From this opening line to the very end, this gentle story of friendship will capture young readers' imaginations. The child assumes that the penguin is lost, which is logical since the lumpy black-and-white bird does look awfully forlorn. Determined to help the creature find its way home, he discovers that penguins come from the South Pole, and the two board a rowboat. During their long sea voyage, the youngster passes the time by telling his companion many stories. However, when they finally reach their destination, he realizes that the penguin was not lost, but just lonely and looking for a friend. The soft watercolor paintings feature simple shapes and a palette that ranges from pale to bold. The boy has a square body, stick legs, and a round head with tiny dot eyes and an expressive mouth. For much of the tale, the characters are placed on crisp white backdrops, while colorful ocean scenes depict their journey. The text's subtle humor and the appealing visuals make this title a wonderful read-aloud.<i>&#x2013;Genevieve Gallagher, Murray Elementary School, Charlottesville, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What does he do in our lives? How can we know him more deeply, and is it possible to tap into his power? Should we pray to the Holy Spirit? Is it possible to be aware of his promptings and speaking into our lives? Dr. Scot McKnight answers these questions and more in this comprehensive examination of what the Bible says about this divinely important, but often confusing member of the Trinity. <br><br>This is the third work in a three-part series examining some of the more mysterious components of the Christian faith. Scot's <i>The Heaven Promise </i>examines the afterlife. <i>The Hum of Angels</i> elucidates the Bible's teaching on God's supernatural messengers and protectors. <i>Now, Open to the Spirit</i> examines the most mysterious member of the Trinity.<br><br>Scot blogs at Patheos, a large multi-perspective blog format. It serves many influential voices from many faith and non-faith traditions. Scot's blog draws primarily a Christian readership; one that is looking for intellectual engagement and thoughtful analysis of Scripture, Theology, and Culture.</p><p><b>Scot McKnight (</b>PhD, University of Nottingham) is professor of New Testament at Northern Theological Seminary in Lombard, Illinois.

Make sure the title is visible to those around you. <br><br>I was on a flight from Colorado Springs to Chicago, and a book about the Spirit was fully visible in the net pouch in front of me. The woman seated next to me was reading a book about finding a new spouse, and during a lull when neither of us was reading, she said something and I said something back and then she tapped my Holy Spirit book. She mentioned that she had grown up in a church that <i>never, ever</i> talked about the Spirit. <br><br>But it turned out that the pastor at her new church in Dallas recently did a sermon series on the Spirit. My fellow passenger said, &#x201c;I never knew how important the Holy Spirit is, and it has rocked my world.&#x201d; <br><br>I&#x2019;m not a person who welcomes commercial-airline conversation. I much prefer silence and even distance from a stranger sitting about as close as the airlines consider tolerable (which is not the same as comfortable). But God&#x2019;s Spirit used the cover of that book and the few things I had told my flight-mate in response to her questions for the woman to tell me about some struggles in her life. Years ago there had been a divorce. My fellow passenger had three daughters, one of whom had been starting a business when her husband &#x201c;came out&#x201d; and abandoned her daughter and their son. With misty eyes, my fellow passenger told me an amazing story of redemption involving her grandson.&nbsp;<br><br>I listened (wishing my psychologist wife, Kris, were present to hear more of what the woman was saying). I felt gratitude to God for caring for this family. The woman finished with, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve learned to hand this all to God and trust God to take care of us all.&#x201d; I had wanted silence in the airspace between Colorado and Illinois, but the Spirit opened me to a story of redemption.<br><br>The Spirit is like that. That is, if we are open to the Spirit. <br><br>As it turned out, the woman seated next to me was more open than I, but the Spirit opened me up to what the Spirit was doing during the flight. <br><br>A sticking point when it comes to our understanding of the Holy Spirit is that humans are <i>not</i> open to the invasive, transcending, and transforming presence of the Holy Spirit. There are, of course, reasons why we are not open. Two that come immediately to mind are (1) we don&#x2019;t want transcending power; and (2) we don&#x2019;t want the transforming presence of God because we&#x2019;d rather stay the way we are.<br><b>A Little Shut, and Pretty Much Not at All Open<br> </b><br>I encountered the Holy Spirit before I knew the Holy Spirit even existed, and back then I was definitely not open. My mother, bless her young-mother heart, believed the Spirit would guide me in my decisions even when I was a preschooler. I was four years old and my family lived in a sleepy village in central Illinois, not far from the Mississippi River. <br><br>Our village wore the name of Roodhouse. My father was a high-school teacher who coached the track-and-field team, and my mother&#x2019;s major responsibility was managing and nurturing three children. I was by far her greatest challenge, not least because our safe village made my wandering away commonplace.<br><br>I was behaviorally conditioned in midafternoon to walk to the high school to join the track team at practice, which is a way of saying my mother was behaviorally conditioned to find some respite from keeping an eye on me. One day she told me there was no track practice that day, and so I was not to walk to the high school. (I failed to mention earlier that walking there entailed crossing a [mostly] sleepy highway.) Sleepy or not, it was a highway, and at age four I was trusted to cross it alone. <br><br>I walked over to the high school three or four times a week during track season, but I was told not to on that particular day. My mother knew I would want to go, so she countered my anticipated wandering by saying, &#x201c;Just listen to the little voice inside you.&#x201d; The little voice was important to my mom. It was her way of referring to a combination of memory, conscience, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. She believed this little voice would remind me to stay home. Which, of course, it did. <br><br>I went to the high school anyway. Once I got there, I realized I was alone, but I preferred being alone at that moment. I ran on the dusty grit of the cinder track, imagining some grand victory. Then I jumped into the long-jump pit with the gusto of a four-year-old, and I did some shadow high jumping, since the contraption wouldn&#x2019;t go as low as I could jump. <br><br>I was having a jolly good time at my own Olympics when I noticed my mother pull up in the family&#x2019;s Nash. She got out abruptly, and this four-year-old knew he was in deep doo-doo. I don&#x2019;t remember the details, but I do recall&#x2014;nearly sixty years later, mind you&#x2014;what my mom said. <br>My mother said, &#x201c;I told you to listen to the little voice inside. Did you?&#x201d; <br><br>I came back with &#x201c;Yes, I did.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And what did that little voice say?&#x201d; <br><br>A four-year-old&#x2019;s disarming moral argument popped into my head: &#x201c;It told me I could go!&#x201d; <br><br>My mother would have none of it, my father would have none of it, and it created a family story that also included my mother&#x2019;s lack of faith in the little-voice theory of moral guidance. On the plus side, though, the little-voice theory was my first encounter with belief in the Holy Spirit. When I told this story to my granddaughter, who is nearly the same age I was at the time of the event, she said, &#x201c;Papa, you didn&#x2019;t have your Listening Ears on!&#x201d; She&#x2019;s right. My ears were shut.<br>Even at the tender age of four I wasn&#x2019;t open.<br><b>Weirdness Led Me to Being Shut Rather Than Open<br></b><br>Move forward about five years. It was a hot Sunday summer evening, and the Apostolic Holiness church in Herrin, Illinois, was holding services. (Herrin was another sleepy town deeper into southern Illinois, near where my grandparents lived in Johnston City.) The service began in a predictably similar fashion to our Baptist church, with greetings, a prayer, and a hymn or two. I had been warned that there would be noticeable contrasts with our anti-charismatic Baptist church. But all I observed was that the Apostolic Holiness folks did what we did but with a little more verve and verbal interaction with the leader. <br><br>Bored as only a preteen could be, I had stopped paying close attention when an odd noise broke out. To swipe words from the inimitable narrative of Andy Griffith, what it was, was Pentecostal worship. The pastor had announced it was prayer time, so everyone prayed&#x2014;out loud. The place erupted&#x2014;suddenly everyone was a chatterbox of prayer. <br><br>I was now fully alert. Some of the people were raising their hands; some walked forward (far too early in the service, at least according to Baptist custom) and knelt at the platform. Others stood at the front with hands raised. One person flattened himself on the floor. The hubbub continued for about five minutes. It sure broke up the boredom. <br><br>While I don&#x2019;t remember a word of the sermon, the invitation was entertaining. Lots of folks came forward to announce they were accepting the Lord&#x2019;s salvation, including a woman whose beehive hairdo drew my attention. My grandmother muttered that it was the woman&#x2019;s third trip to the altar in three weeks. Grandma added that the woman &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t have enough salvation to last her a week.&#x201d; <br><br>Now that I think about it, my father was a mild Calvinist (he was a fan of the English Calvinist Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon as well as Horatius Bonar, another Calvinist). My dad explained that Grandma was an Arminian who thought people could lose their salvation. In contrast, we believed in &#x201c;eternal security,&#x201d; which meant &#x201c;once saved, always saved.&#x201d; Our theory was way more comfortable. Anyway, that was my earliest encounter with Christians who seemed to take for granted that the Holy Spirit was right there during evening worship: they felt the Spirit&#x2019;s presence and acted accordingly. <br><br>My grandmother told me later that she wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201c;charismatic,&#x201d; a word she pronounced with serious displeasure. Rather, she was &#x201c;Pentecostal,&#x201d; which to her was the most serious sort of Holy Spirit Christian. For my grandmother, charismatics were the soft, modern version of old-time, all-in Pentecostals. <br><br>That single experience at my grandparents&#x2019; church just about ruined me on the Holy Spirit. Perhaps because of how I had been nurtured into the faith, that experience struck me as beyond weird. If that was what Holy Spirit religion meant, I wanted no part of it.<br><b>Arguments for Being Shut Off When It Comes to the Holy Spirit<br></b><br>The anti-charismatic context of my home church contrasted sharply with the Apostolic Holiness service. They both played a part in my slamming shut any openness to the Spirit.&nbsp;Little did I know how eccentric these Pentecostals were, nor could I have anticipated that the broader movement of those who are open to the Spirit would end up nearly 600 million strong.&nbsp;So big is this movement that one of America&#x2019;s chief historians of the church, Martin Marty, told <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>writer Laurie Goodstein, &#x201c;If I were to buy stock in global Christianity, I would buy it in Pentecostalism.&#x201d;<br><br>But the world in which I was nurtured opposed Pentecostalism and all its kindred spirits. Not only that, we had theology and arguments and slogans to back up our shutting down of the Spirit. (My church upbringing sheds light on the theme of Francis Chan&#x2019;s book that the Spirit was, for us, the &#x201c;forgotten God.&#x201d;) About the only mention of the Spirit I heard in those days was on the radio listening to Don McLean&#x2019;s famous song &#x201c;American Pie.&#x201d; When he spoke of &#x201c;the three men I admire most,&#x201d; he mentioned each Person in the Trinity, including the Holy Ghost! In his inimitable rhyme, McLean sings: &#x201c;They caught the last train for the coast.&#x201d;<br><br>The Spirit of God might as well have left for the coast, as far as my Baptist fellow believers were concerned. We had a cupboard stocked with arguments against charismatics and their Spirit-based theology. Among them:<br><br>~ &#x201c;The (glitzy) gifts (such as tongues, prophecy, and miracles) were for the apostolic period only.&#x201d;<br><br>~ &#x201c;In the New Testament, not every conversion led to speaking in tongues, so tongues cannot be seen as the sign of conversion.&#x201d;<br><br>~ &#x201c;There are not two baptisms&#x2014;one by water, one by the Spirit&#x2014;but just one baptism.&#x201d;<br><br>~ &#x201c;The Holy Spirit does not want all this attention. The Spirit gives testimony to the Son, so this charismatic stuff must be wrong.&#x201d; <br><br>~ &#x201c;Christians who are obsessed by the Holy Spirit are the most prone to theological error and to chaos. Eventually their enthusiasm and mysticism will cool, and Pentecostals will be like the rest of us. Either that, or they will turn to some kind of heresy.&#x201d;<br><br>~ &#x201c;Those who are most enthralled with the Spirit are the most shaped by their inner experiences&#x2014;emotion and personal feelings. They also are the least theologically trained.&#x201d;<br><br>~ &#x201c;Charismatics believe in a two-stage theory of salvation: first you become a Christian; next you get the second blessing or you get filled with the Spirit or you enter into the Higher Life or you get fully sanctified and perfected and become sinless.&#x201d; <br><br>~ &#x201c;We need to focus on salvation and justification and the cross. All this talk about the Spirit distracts from that focus.&#x201d;<br><br>The sum of the matter in my church context, though not explicitly acknowledged, was this: Our theology was one of the Father and the Son, and the Spirit was ignored, neglected, or minimized. At best the Spirit got &#x201c;third place&#x201d; in the God-contest for supremacy.&nbsp;To put all our nervous-about-the-Spirit rationalizations into one tight bundle, we reduced the Spirit by resorting to reason, to intellect, to the mind, to the Bible. In doing so, we relegated the Spirit of God, the Third Person of the Trinity, to an idea that our superior logic and careful theology had made irrelevant. Behind our avoidance of the Holy Spirit was the fear that if we were to let the Spirit loose, chaos was sure to result. A free-ranging Spirit was unpredictable and uncontrollable. How could we allow such a Being to intrude on our most cherished habits, routines, and ideas? <br><br>Put into another bundle, we believed in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp;Surely God&#x2019;s revelation in the scriptures provided all the teaching, all the guidance, and all the insights we needed pertaining to God and God&#x2019;s ways. <br><br>The arguments were deeply flawed, and reading them now makes me and those who believed as I did seem embarrassingly naive. But back then, it all seemed quite convincing. It justified my natural inclination to remain closed to the Holy Spirit. I learned in my church world to silence the Spirit.&nbsp;<br><b>Unlocking the Closed-In Way of Life <br></b><br>This book attempts to make clear what the Bible reveals about God&#x2019;s Spirit. Readers can also see it as the story of my conversion from the anti-charismatic movement to an affirmation of the centrality of the Holy Spirit and the importance of the Spirit for the Christian life. I have come to believe, along with theologian Clark Pinnock, that the Spirit works in &#x201c;a hundred thousand ways&#x201d; and that it is not my responsibility to do anything but to be open to the radical and sometimes surprising flow of the Spirit in our world. I believe that is what the Bible teaches, and I hope the time we spend pursuing the truth about the Holy Spirit will lead you to a similar belief. <br><br>During World War II, a miracle took place repeatedly in the village of Le Chambon in southern France. Residents of the town, Andr� and Magda Trocm�, were deeply committed Christians who lived out their village&#x2019;s commitment to rescuing Jews who had been displaced from their homes.</p><h2>WorldPerfect: The Jewish Impact on Civilization</h2><p><p>In pursuit of an answer to the question of what would constitute a perfect world, author Ken Spiro questioned more than 1,500 people of various backgrounds and religions. His findings revealed six core elements: Respect for human life; peace and harmony; justice and equality; education; family; and social responsibility. He then set off on a journey to find out why these were such common goals across cultural, economic, social and racial lines, and in the process, traced the history of the development of world religions, values and ethics. </p> <p>As a rabbi, he paid particular attention to how Judaism impacted, and was influenced by, the course of these developments. The result is a highly readable and well-documented book about the origins of values and virtues in Western civilization as influenced by the Greeks, Romans, Christians, Muslims and, most significantly, the Jews.</p> <p>The history of religion, presented in Spiro&#x2019;s highly readable style, is a fascinating and timely subject, especially in today&#x2019;s volatile religious climate. Spiro divides his book into five engaging parts:</p> <ul><li>Where the Quality of Mercy Was Not Strained: The World of Greece and Rome</li> <li>Against the Grain: The Jewish View</li> <li>A Father to Many Nations: Abraham and the Implications of Monotheism</li> <li>With Sword and Fire: The Rise of Christianity and Islam</li> <li>The New Promised Land: Impact of Judaism on Liberal Democracies</li></ul> <p>Readers of all faiths will find that the elements of a perfect world can only be achieved by a common understanding of our mutual backgrounds and that our diverse religions are all merely branches growing from one single tree.</p></p><p>Ken Spiro is a rabbi and dynamic lecturer. He holds a Master of Arts degree in history and a bachelor of arts degree in Russian language and literature. He developed the acclaimed seminar &#34;WorldPerfect: The Jewish Impact on Civilization,&#34; which brings Jewish history alive for thousands of people each year.</p><h2>Walt Disney: Young Movie Maker (Childhood of Famous Americans)</h2><p>A biography concentrating on the boyhood of the cartoonist and film maker who created Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck</p><p>Marie Hammontree (1913&#x2013;2012) was born in Indiana and lived there her entire life.

For some time he had watched the people in the busy Chicago railroad station. Everybody seemed to be in a hurry.

We&#x2019;ll listen for the call together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walt climbed up on the seat beside his brother. He was very quiet as he listened. Somebody was calling a train now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Detroit. Lansing. Flint. Port Huron. Toronto. Montreal. Train on Track Four. All abooo-a-rd!&#x201d; The sound echoed up and down the station and back again.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do they mean, Roy? All aboo-a-rd!&#x201d; Walt spoke in a loud voice, just as if he was calling trains. People all around stopped and looked. Then they laughed.<br> <br>Thirteen-year-old Roy laughed. &#x201c;They mean anybody who wants to ride on that train had better hurry and get on it. The train will leave in just a few minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, come on!&#x201d; Walt tugged at his brother&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to miss it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a minute, Walter.

They sat beside their parents and were glum as could be.<br> <br>Mr. Elias Disney nudged Herbert&#x2019;s foot with his. &#x201c;I wish you boys had a little of Walter&#x2019;s eagerness. I know you will like our farm at Marceline when you see it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seventeen-year-old Herbert shook his head doubtfully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I will like it, Dad. I&#x2019;d like to stay in Chicago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; said Raymond, who was fifteen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we still have a few days left to be in Chicago. I&#x2019;m not at all anxious to leave the city for a farm at Marceline.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, those days are going to be busy ones,&#x201d; said Mr. Disney. &#x201c;We have a lot of packing to do, and we&#x2019;ll have to work fast. We want to join your mother as quickly as possible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll hurry,&#x201d; said Mrs. Flora Disney. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Roy and I will need all the help we can get on the farm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll work as hard as we can,&#x201d; said Herbert. &#x201c;But, Mother, you know our hearts won&#x2019;t be in it. We don&#x2019;t want to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Disney understood. She knew how unhappy her two older sons were. She knew how they hated to leave their friends and their life in the city. She spoke gently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to change homes, but a person can never really tell about a place until he&#x2019;s tried it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother is right. Someday you will be glad you had a chance to live in the country,&#x201d; Mr. Disney said firmly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly why I bought the farm. Why, look at you&#x2014;soft, no muscles! City life is unhealthy for boys. Sometimes city boys get into bad company, too. Then they get into trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Disney could feel another argument coming. Elias was a good father, but he just didn&#x2019;t understand boys. &#x201c;Now, Elias,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t be too hard on Herbert and Raymond. It will take time for them to get used to farm life. They will miss Chicago. They will have to make new friends. It&#x2019;s not going to be easy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Herbert and Raymond didn&#x2019;t say a word. They knew their mother had listened to many arguments between them and their father. They knew she was sorry to leave Chicago too. But Mr. Disney had made up his mind. He had bought the farm, and now they had to move.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe Roy will like the farm,&#x201d; Herbert spoke at last. He knew he must be more cheerful for his mother&#x2019;s sake. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no doubt about it. Walter will like the farm. Walter will love the animals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ruth doesn&#x2019;t care at all that she is leaving the city,&#x201d; Raymond added, trying to make a joke. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s sound asleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Disney hugged the little girl lying in her arms. &#x201c;Well, our Ruth is only two years old. This has been a big day for her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wonder Walter isn&#x2019;t asleep,&#x201d; said Mr. Disney. &#x201c;He must be tired. He was up long before daylight this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It surprises me, too. But I expect Walter is too excited to go to sleep. This is a new experience. After all, this will be his first long ride on a train. You know how curious Walter is about everything he sees.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then Walt jumped from his seat. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re calling our train!&#x201d; he announced.<br> <br>Indeed they were, and loudly! &#x201c;Joliet. Streator. Chillicothe. Galesburg. Fort Madison. Shopton. Marceline. Carrollton. Kansas City. Track Two. All abooo-a-rd!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All abooo-a-rd!&#x201d; yelled Walt. &#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d;<br> <br>Once more everybody laughed. This time Herbert and Raymond laughed. They couldn&#x2019;t help themselves. They were excited too.<br> <br>RAILROAD TALK<br> <br>The whole Disney family hurried to the train. They got on the train too. Of course not all of them stayed on the train. Mr. Disney, Herbert, and Raymond soon said good-bye. They stayed only long enough to make certain the baggage was properly placed and Mrs. Disney and the children were comfortably settled.<br> <br>Walt didn&#x2019;t stay settled for long, however. He ran from one window of the train to another. He didn&#x2019;t want to miss a thing. He especially wanted to see the man in uniform standing by the train steps. &#x201c;Roy, what&#x2019;s that man down there doing?&#x201d; Walt called.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the conductor,&#x201d; Roy explained. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s about to give a signal to start the train.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walt pressed his nose against the window glass.<br> <br>The conductor did appear to be giving a signal. He held his right hand high in the air. At the same time he looked at his watch in his left hand. Then, all of a sudden, he gave a loud call. &#x201c;Booo-a-rd!&#x201d;<br> <br>In a few seconds Walt announced, &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re moving.&#x201d; He was right. The train picked up speed. It creaked and it squeaked. It rounded a bend in the track. It swayed.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re on our way to Missouri!&#x201d; Walt sang. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on our way. We&#x2019;re on our way.&#x201d;</p><h2>Jack Johnson - In Between Dreams</h2><p>(Play It Like It Is).

Lauderdale beach community through psychological, physical and sexual abuse. But on a summer night in 1993, Bobby was lured to the edge of the Florida everglades with a promise of sex and drugs. . .and was never seen alive again. The tormentor had become the victim in a bizarre and brutal act of vengeance carried out with ruthless efficiency and cold-blooded premeditation by seven of his high school acquaintances--including his lifelong best friend--and instigated by one overweight, underloved teenager who believed her life would be perfect. . .if only Bobby Kent were dead.<p>BULLY is a riveting story of adolescent rage and bloody revenge--all the more harrowing and horrific because its true.</p></p><p>Jim Schutze combines natural details about the sawgrass marshes and roaring alligators of the area south of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with keen observations about the fantasy lives of teenagers hooked on surfing, steroids, and instant gratification, to paint a harrowing picture of seven suburban kids who slide all too easily into moral depravity. At the heart of his tale is a kind of love triangle: the &#34;bully,&#34; his best friend Marty, and Marty&#39;s girlfriend, who fiercely desires to rescue Marty from a strangely destructive friendship with strong homosexual undertones. Schutze&#39;s account of the aftermath of the murder includes interesting details on how the police skillfully lured confessions from the kids involved. I found the writing to have a few inconsistencies, and I wished the author had provided more background about how he reconstructed the dialogue, but those are small reservations about an excellent book overall.Told with Jim Schutze's trademark precision and investigative savvy, <b>Bully</b> is a disturbing tale of modern-day teenage revenge. Bobby Kent and Marty Puccio grew up best buddies at opposite ends of a walled Fort Lauderdale community. Beneath the cheery suburban facade, the sinister lure of the Everglades was never far away. Marty was kind, but Bobby was a sadistic bully who dominated his high school friends psychologically, physically, and sexually. When they finally couldn't take it anymore, they set out to kill him. What the kids in Bobby's group did one night on the swampy edge of the Everglades, and how they and their families reacted when they were caught is a harrowing commentary on our society and the intensity of a rage rooted in love. But at the heart of this gripping story is an act of unspeakable revenge and the question of whether such vengeance is ever justified. <p> <b>Bully</b> is a story so unthinkable that it can't be true, but the emotions it evokes are so familiar that it can't be anything but real.</p></p><h2>Maybe Someday</h2><p>Sydney has life sorted.

Today the small island stands alongside Plymouth Rock in our nation's founding mythology as the place where many of our ancestors first touched American soil. </p> <p> <i>American Passage</i> captures a time and a place unparalleled in American immigration and history, and articulates the dramatic and bittersweet accounts of the immigrants, officials, interpreters, and social reformers who all played an important role in Ellis Island's chronicle. In this sweeping, often heart-wrenching epic, Vincent J. Cannato reveals that the history of Ellis Island is ultimately the story of what it means to be an American. </p></p><p><p>Vincent J. Cannato teaches history at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. He is the author of <em>The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York</em> and has written for <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley Ellis Island, through which 12 million immigrants passed between 1892 and 1924, is a museum and tourist attraction now, "a success," according to Vincent J. Cannato, "attracting some 2 million visitors a year." A small patch of land in New York Harbor, known two centuries ago as Gibbet Island because so many pirates were hanged there, it occupies a large but somewhat ambiguous place in American history. On the one hand, it is deservedly celebrated as the country's gateway, not the only one but the largest and most important. On the other hand, it is the place where a deep conflict in American beliefs has been played out: "The nation's immigration law was predicated on the idea that a self-governing people could decide who may or may not enter the country. But that idea came into conflict with other ideals such as America's traditional history of welcoming newcomers. More importantly, it conflicted with the idea that the rights guaranteed in the Constitution were universal rights. How could the Declaration of Independence's basic creed that all individuals were created equal mesh with the idea that some immigrants were desirable and others undesirable? That conflict between American ideals is central to an understanding of why Ellis Island was created in the first place." Obviously, the story of Ellis Island remains pertinent today, for the issues it raises still vex and divide us. In the early years of the 20th century, most immigrants came to the United States from Europe, and the question in the minds of many Americans was whether some of them (British, French, German) were more "desirable" than others (Eastern and Southern Europeans). Now the great wave of immigration is from Latin America, and because many of these people enter the country illegally, the question is whether this makes them "undesirable," even though many of them work productively and contribute to the national economy. Ellis Island was established as a "sieve" through which immigrants could be filtered, the desirable allowed to enter, the undesirable deported back to their countries of origin. But as became plain from almost the moment it opened, defining "desirable" and "undesirable" was difficult and often caused intense controversy. William Williams, director of Ellis Island for many years, was a WASP aristo who "linked undesirability to southern and eastern Europeans," just as many Bostonians regarded the Irish as undesirable. One blue-blooded New England Yankee, discussing the " 'masses of peasantry' from Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Russia in the 1890s," didn't beat around the bush: "These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement. They have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which made it comparatively easy to deal with the immigration of olden time. They are beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence. Centuries are against them, as centuries were on the side of those who formerly came to us." Out of such sentiments grew the Immigration Restriction League, founded in 1894 "to advocate and work for the further judicious restriction or stricter regulation of immigration," i.e., No Italians Need Apply. These and other efforts by Boston Brahmins and their allies stirred up noise and debate but don't seem to have had all that much effect on the decisions made by officials at Ellis Island, who were chiefly preoccupied with questions of physical and mental health, the ability to earn a gainful wage and "moral turpitude," a euphemism for everything from prostitution to adultery to premarital sex. During World War I "alien enemies" -- "any male over the age of fourteen born in Germany, residing in the United States, and not a naturalized U.S. citizen" -- found their rights sharply limited and were at risk of being arrested; after the war, fear of radicals generally, and anarchists specifically, added a new category of "undesirables." A "recurring theme throughout Ellis Island's history," Cannato writes, is "the chasm between immigration law as written and immigration law as enforced." Or, as he puts it elsewhere, "The immigration problem was a conflict between abstract laws and the individual tragedies those laws sometimes created." It was one thing to deny admission to the "feeble-minded," but quite another when an entire family presented itself for admission and one child was deemed to fit that category. How were officials to respond: Deny admission to the entire family, or admit all save the offending girl? In one such case the second course was chosen, leaving the girl to live out the rest of her life -- how she did so we do not know -- on her own. Generally, though, Ellis Island tended toward the permissive. Some of those who worked there were bigoted, and many, it seems, were simply incompetent, but Cannato reports numerous instances in which people who were borderline "undesirable" for one reason or another were granted admission on essentially humanitarian grounds. President William Howard Taft, making a visit to the island, found himself caught up in one such case, though his sympathetic response to the immigrant under examination ultimately was overruled by authorities directly responsible. The immigration center was closed in 1954, by which time a quota system was in effect and overall immigration had declined sharply. Two years later the General Services Administration put the entire 27-acre island up for sale, but reaction against turning over the historic site to private interests -- "the high bidder was a New York builder . . . who wanted to turn Ellis Island into Pleasure Island, a high-end resort with a convention center, marina, and recreational and cultural facilities" -- was strong enough to persuade the Eisenhower Administration to take it off the market. It deteriorated until 1981, when a fund-raising program for its restoration was undertaken, eventually under the leadership of Lee Iacocca, whose parents went through Ellis Island in 1921. Cannato, who teaches history at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, has written a popular rather than scholarly history of Ellis Island, but he resists the temptation to sentimentalize the place. He understands that, now as then, immigration is an issue that leaves Americans uncomfortable and contentious, even as it continues to bring new blood and energy into the country. Ellis Island may have been converted into something of a feel-good theme park, but the questions it raises remain unresolved. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

One way she does that is through her blog project Registrar Trek, aimed at raising awareness for collections care in general and fostering exchange between collections specialists around the world. Another way is this book in which she gathered her own experiences and those of several colleagues to develop a framework for people confronted with a previously unmanaged, only partly managed or just neglected collection.It is her experience of working with a number of collections in varying states of management that led her to write this absorbing and valuable book. At some point in our careers, those of us working in collections care are likely to be confronted with one that has not been cared for to the expected standards. Managing Previously Unmanaged Collections is intended as a practical guide to address these situations. . . .The watchword for the book is practicality. . . .The language is mercifully accessible and shorn of irrelevant buzzwords, yet always clear, knowledgeable and coherent. This alone is remarkable, considering it is written in the author&#x2019;s second language. . . .It is clear that the book is not just the result of one person&#x2019;s experience. Kipp invited contributions and advice from museum professionals on her blog throughout the process of writing the book. This has resulted in a rich base of experience from which to address issues. The real-world examples from contributors across the globe give a realistic context to Kipp&#x2019;s advice and a different voice to the text, all of which adds to the book&#x2019;s accessibility. Even for those yet to confront an unmanaged collection on a meaningful scale, this book is essential for anyone caring for museum objects. Its clear and supportive language, coupled with the many practical nuggets of advice, will make it a valuable companion for all. (<i>Museums Journal</i>)<br><br>This book not only serves as a useful guide on how to approach unmanaged collections, but it also leaves the reader with a sense that they are not alone in their situations. Every collection has room for improvement, and any improvement, no matter how small, can be considered a success. (<i>AASLH History News</i>)<br><br>Managing Previously Unmanaged Collections is a must have for the library of any collections caretaker! This book takes the ideas of project management and applies them to those messy collections that we all face at least once in our career. Kipp provides guidelines that will help both the new collections manager and veterans work their way through those unmanaged collections.

The majority of the book assumes a basic background in logic design and software programming concepts. It is directed at: �students currently in an introductory logic design course that also teaches SystemVerilog, �designers who want to update their skills from Verilog or VHDL, and �students in VLSI design and advanced logic design courses that include verification as well as design topics. The book starts with a tutorial introduction on hardware description languages and simulation. It proceeds to the register-transfer design topics of combinational and finite state machine (FSM) design &#x2014; these mirror the topics of introductory logic design courses. The book covers the design of FSM-datapath designs and their interfaces, including SystemVerilog interfaces. Then it covers the more advanced topics of writing testbenches including using assertions and functional coverage. A comprehensive index provides easy access to the book&#x2019;s topics.The goal of the book is to introduce the broad spectrum of features in the language in a way that complements introductory and advanced logic design and verification courses, and then provides a basis for further learning.Solutions to problems at the end of chapters, and text copies of the SystemVerilog examples are available from the author as described in the Preface.</p><p>Donald Thomas is Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University where he has taught logic design, RT-level design, design languages (Verilog and SystemVerilog), verification, and computer-aided design algorithms for the design of integrated circuits and systems.</p><h2>The Funny Thing</h2><p>Wanda Gag is a sequel to Millions of Cats.</p><p>Wanda Gg (1893-1946) was born in New Ulm, Minnesota, the daughter of an artist and the eldest of seven children.

And that had been ten years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he wasn't interested in Whit. He was interested in the diminutive woman on his arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward knew her almost jet black hair, deep blue eyes, and creamy English complexion so well.<br><br> And she looked well now, even in newsprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed tanned.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was finally back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her absences always seemed interminable to Edward.&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper said that she had just come from Marbella, where she had been seen over the weekend, staying at the Spanish summer home of her aunt, the Contessa di San Ricamini, n*e Hilary Saint Martin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that Kezia had summered in the South of France, in "almost total seclusion."&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward laughed at the thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had seen her column regularly all summer, with reports from London, Paris, Barcelona, Nice, and Rome.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had had a busy summer, in "seclusion."<br><br> A paragraph further down the same page mentioned three others who had arrived on the same flight as Kezia.&nbsp;&nbsp;the so suddenly powerful daughter of the Greek shipping magnate, who had left her, his only heir, the bulk of his fortune. And there was mention as well of the Belgian princess, fresh from the Paris collections for a little junket to New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezia had been in good company on the flight, and Edward wondered how much money she had taken from them at backgammon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kezia was a most effective player.&nbsp;&nbsp;It struck him too that it was once again Kezia who got most of the press coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that way for her. Always the center of attention, the sparkle as she walked into restaurants and out of theaters.&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been at its cruelest peak when she was in her teens; the photographers and reporters were always hungry, curious, prying, then.&nbsp;&nbsp;For years it had seemed that she was followed everywhere by a fleet of piranhas, but that was when she had first inherited her father's fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they were used to&nbsp;&nbsp;her, and their attention seemed kinder. <br><br> At first Edward had tried hard to shield her from the press. That first year. That first, godawful, intolerable, excruciating year, when she was nine.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the scavengers had only been waiting. And they hadn't waited long.&nbsp;&nbsp;It came as a shock to Kezia when she was thirteen, to be followed by a red-hot young woman reporter into Elizabeth Arden's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezia hadn't understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reporter had.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had understood plenty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward's face grew hard at the memory. Bitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;How could she do that to a child? She had asked her about Liane, right there in front of everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you feel when your mother..." The reporter was four years late with her story.&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of a job by noon the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward was disappointed: he had hoped to have her job by the same night. And that was Kezia's first taste of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notoriety.&nbsp;&nbsp;Power.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;A name.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents with histories.&nbsp;&nbsp;And grandparents with histories and power and money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine generations of it on her mother's side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only three worth mentioning on her father's.&nbsp;&nbsp;History.&nbsp;&nbsp;Power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things you can't conjure up, or lie about, or steal.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to be born with them running thick in your veins.&nbsp;&nbsp;All three.&nbsp;&nbsp;And beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;And style.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then with some other magical ingredient dancing in you at lightning speed, then...and only then, are you Kezia Saint Martin.&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was only one.<br><br> Edward stirred the coffee in the white-and-gold Limoges cup on his desk, and settled back to look at the view.&nbsp;&nbsp;The East River, dotted with small boats and barges, was a narrow gray ribbon far below on his right.&nbsp;&nbsp;He faced north from where he sat, and gazed peacefully over the congestion of midtown Manhattan, past its skyscrapers, to look down on the sturdy residential fortresses of Park Avenue and Fifth, huddled near the clump of browning green that was Central Park, and in the distance, a blur that was Harlem.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was merely a part of his view, and not a part that interested him a great deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward was a busy man.<br><br> He sipped the coffee, and turned to "Martin Hallam's" column to see who among his acquaintances was allegedly in love with whom, who was giving a dinner party where, who would attend, and who would presumably not show up because of the latest social feud.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew only too well that there would be an item or two from Marbella.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew Kezia's style well enough to knew that she would mention herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was thorough and prudent.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was right.&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the list of returning refugees after a summer abroad: Scooter Hollingsworth, Bibi Adams-Jones, Melissa Sentry, Jean-Claude Reims, Kezia Saint Martin, and Julian Bodley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, hail, the gang's all here!

S. Lewis cannot be fully understood apart from a grasp of his formative adolescent years. Unfortunately, many biographies speed over this important season of Lewis&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Slowing down to focus on his younger years, this detailed portrait of &#x201c;Jack&#x201d; Lewis helps us discover seeds of what would inform his later writings&#x2015;such as his delight in literature, his key relationships, his suffering and struggles, and his intense pursuit of joy.</p><p>The chapters unfold the habits and tastes he developed while at boarding school, in college, and in the army, revealing where we see these themes appear in his works&#x2015;bringing to life the man readers have come to know as C.

Poe hosts regular Inklings Weekend retreats and is a speaker on Lewis at major libraries worldwide.</p><p>&#x201c;Harry Lee Poe&#x2019;s biography of Lewis&#x2019;s early years is an engaging book filled with glimpses of the celebrated author that cannot be found in any other biography of Lewis.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Lyle W.

Wade Center</p><p>&#x201c;A unique coming-of-age biography of C. S. Lewis that stands out in revealing how his early life shaped the future Lewis: body, mind, and soul. It vividly captures the whole person of Lewis&#x2015;not only an aspect of him but also the variety and depth of his defining features. The result is an eye-opening, important, and rich portrait that benefits from the teeming knowledge and thorough research of the author. It includes the often-neglected, lasting significance of the people who impacted the often-solitary young Lewis, with illuminating flash-forwards to the future Lewis.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Colin Duriez,</strong>&nbsp;author, <em>C.

Lewis</i> breaks new ground in the study of Lewis&#x2019;s life. Specifically, Poe concentrates on the early years of Lewis&#x2019;s life&#x2015;an area largely neglected or glossed over by other biographers&#x2015;and explores in rich detail the people, ideas, and experiences that shaped Lewis&#x2019;s adult life. Mining the fertile cache of material available in the Lewis Papers&#x2015;the eleven-volume archive compiled by Lewis&#x2019;s brother, Warren&#x2015;Poe offers convincing arguments about how Lewis&#x2019;s earliest interests find expression in his adult writings. The themes found later in Lewis&#x2019;s magisterial works had their inception in Lewis&#x2019;s youthful writings, particularly in his lifelong correspondence with his boyhood friend Arthur Greeves. Readers intent on obtaining a deeper understanding of the most important Christian writer of the last hundred years will find <i>Becoming C. S.

This portrait of an artist as a young man is based on remarkably rich information that we have concerning Lewis&#x2019;s formative experiences and influences. Harry Lee Poe adds much helpful context and commentary.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>George M. Marsden,</strong> author, <em>C. S.

Lewis&#x2019;s tremendous achievements later in life&#x2015;as a writer of imaginative fiction and poetry, a literary critic, and a Christian apologist&#x2015;we should look to his formative years. Harry Lee Poe&#x2019;s <i>Becoming C. S.

The elderly patrons, biting at pipes and smelling of turf smoke, rolled in amusement.<br>"Ye&#x2019;re thinking of walking an ass about Ireland?" jawed Hugh Mannion from a high stool. "I have two at home that won&#x2019;t cross Derrane Bog!"<br>"Arragh, Hughie, now, be fair to your man," chimed Willie Cassidy from behind a hand of playing cards. "There&#x2019;d only be the one ass that could circle the Ring of Ireland, and that&#x2019;d be Johnny Rabbitt&#x2019;s jackass who swallowed the umbrella!"<br>I soothed my throat with a generous swallow of the black native Guinness, and sought refuge by the potbellied stove, flashing back to my inaugural pint here when I was seventeen. That long-ago summer, my younger brother Dermot and I were unwillingly sworn into the Celtic race in a drunken stupor. Now, on this cold winter night in 1979, thirteen years later, nothing had changed in this illustrious parish pub but the Harp calendar.<br>My uncle Vincent, to whom I had sketchily mentioned my plans, had warned that my "donkey proposal" would be greeted with ridicule by these age-old pensioners, who gathered every Friday evening at Rattigan&#x2019;s. But who else knew more about a donkey&#x2019;s strengths and limitations than themselves?<br>I took another gulp of the milk-warm stout, thinking back on that wondrous incident days earlier. Pedaling home to my grandmother&#x2019;s on the Knockcroghery Road, I was knocked off my bike like Saul from his horse when I saw a farmer smoothly tipping his donkey and cart down the road. "That&#x2019;s it," I gasped at the vision. "That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m going to travel the whole of Ireland."<br>Now, taking a deep breath and another fortifying sip, I mustered the courage to speak above their merriment.<br>"But say, for instance, I was truly willing to go through with it. Could a donkey, a good one, travel the coast of Ireland? I&#x2019;d take it easy, eight to ten miles a day, and I&#x2019;d give myself eight months to travel the eighteen hundred miles."<br>Rheumy eyes glinted and glanced. The Yank wasn&#x2019;t having them on: he was dead serious. The house went silent. Playing cards were flattened. Miserable March rattled outside the panes. Pints were called for and collected as the old gentry of the parish circled their stools to gather their wisdom.<br>"A jackass, cut-jack, or a mare?" asked Mickey Owens, still eyeing me with suspicion.<br>"Never a jack," voiced Jack Rattigan, lifting the cap off his brow. "A jack would be braying sonnets in June, bugling day and night in August, and downright altogether mad in the snows of December."<br>"A cut-jack, then?" suggested Joe Hickey.<br>"A cut-jack is neither useful nor ornamental," mused Jim Tiernan. "A cut-jack has no heart. Nipped. Dry as polished glass. &#x2019;tis a mare the Yank would need, young and well-handled."<br>"The very thing," agreed the tall and scholarly Headmaster D&#x2019;Alton. "A young mare sound of wind and limb, and a fine temperament. You wouldn&#x2019;t want her kicking the stars from the sky."<br>"A good mouth and square feet," added Hugh Mannion, "free of spavins, curbs, and sidebones. And she&#x2019;d need to be well-shod with pony shoes and frost nails to cover those miles."<br>I stood among these wizened fellows&#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s former schoolmates&#x2014;nodding my head in agreement, but not having a blooming idea what they were on about.<br>"A double fistful of oats every morning would do her kindly," continued Willie Cassidy. "But don&#x2019;t go giving her a bucket of water after a good feed, or she&#x2019;ll cripple up and die with the gripe."<br>"Search Roscommon and Westmeath for your mare," offered Paddy Tiernan, "and don&#x2019;t go to any knackers or horse jobbers. With your Yankee accent, they&#x2019;d sell you a mule without a tooth in its head."<br>"Better still," added Dan Madden, "if you&#x2019;re sincere in setting out on this caper, go see the horseman, Jimmy McDermott, in Kilteevan. If there&#x2019;s ever a mare that can circle Ireland, Jimmy Mac would be the one to find her."<br>"And keep a safe distance from the Spanish jacks," jabbed a smart aleck from the corner, "or your mare will be carrying extra baggage on the road home!"<br>The donkey seminar ended abruptly as the playing cards, itching in the hands of Willie Cassidy, were reshuffled and dealt again: the quarter-final round of "25" for an Easter turkey was at stake. Jim Tiernan, however, joined me by the stove. My grandmother&#x2019;s neighbor in the village of Ballincurry, he told me how his donkey could travel twenty Irish miles&#x2014;twenty-five English miles&#x2014;a day on a pinch of oats.<br>"An ass would go forever if you gave her her time," said old Jim, rubbing a plug of tobacco in his hands. "Pity is, too many farmers hurried and abused them. The only worry I see in you traipsing the world with a mare is that she could easily become homesick and lose heart. And when a mare loses heart, nothing will set her going again."<br>"What makes a mare lose heart?" I asked the affable man.<br>"&#x2019;Tis easy enough, I&#x2019;m afraid," he continued, packing his yellowed briar pipe with his thumb. "Mare asses worked a hard long day in Roscommon. But whether they were off to market with a sow, to the creamery with a can or two, to the bog for a cartload of turf, or to the fields to draw in the hay, they always knew they&#x2019;d be home by nightfall to be fed and watered. Your mare won&#x2019;t have that luxury, for she&#x2019;ll be traveling the roads day after day, over mountain and bog, and at night be tethered in a different field or placed in some stinking byre. Nor will she be able to make any sense of your wanderings.<br>"I suppose a jack would be right for your journey if they weren&#x2019;t so ornery," he went on, lighting his pipe. "A jack is a common rogue, a rambler, but a mare likes her home. I heard a story years back of how a County Longford man sold his mare heavy in foal to a County Fermanagh man. The deal was settled over a jar of stout and the mare was boxed and carted up through Longford, Leitrim, and beyond the border town of Enniskillen. Fifty miles, if not more. Well, wouldn&#x2019;t you know, three days later this same Longford farmer was walking his fields, only to spot the sold mare feeding her downy foal. The poor creature had made good her escape and traveled fifty miles in two days to give birth on the third. Now, doesn&#x2019;t that give you some idea of their homing instincts?"<br>Of course, not everyone at Rattigan&#x2019;s was as helpful as Jim Tiernan. There was a scrum of old wags who brayed and whinnied throughout the seminar, asking one another if both my oars were cleaving the sea and other opprobrious remarks better left forgotten. But, all in all, it had been a fine evening. My proposed journey, however whimsical, now seemed at least plausible.<br>I sat on a wooden bench by the doorway, finishing my drink and tucking my pants into my socks for the bike ride home, when Hugh Mannion addressed the happy crowd, saying I&#x2019;d be nothing short of a folk hero if I managed to circle Ireland with a donkey and cart.<br>"He&#x2019;d be much like those wise men," he exclaimed, raising his bottle of barley wine, "who climbed Faerymount one</strong></em></strong></strong></p></p><h2>The Ledge: An Inspirational Story of Friendship and Survival</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;&#x201c;The authors bring extreme climbing to life. . . . Perhaps no author can rationalize why some choose to risk their lives . . . for the thrill of conquering a mountain. <i>The Ledge</i> comes perilously close and tells a ripping true story at the same time.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Denver Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> In June 1992, best friends Jim Davidson and Mike Price stood atop Washington&#x2019;s Mount Rainier, celebrating what they hoped would be the first of many milestones in their lives as passionate mountaineers. Then their triumph turned tragic when a cave-in plunged them deep inside a glacial crevasse&#x2014;the pitch-black, ice-walled hell of every climber&#x2019;s nightmares.<br> &nbsp;<br> An avid adventurer since youth, Davidson was a seasoned climber at the time of the Rainier ascent. But the harrowing free fall left him challenged by nature&#x2019;s grandeur at its most unforgiving. Trapped on a narrow frozen shelf, deep below daylight, he desperately battled crumbling ice, snow that threatened to bury him alive, and crippling fear of the inescapable chasm below&#x2014;all the while struggling to save his fatally injured friend. Finally, alone, with little equipment and rapidly dwindling hope, he confronted a fateful choice: the certainty of a slow, lonely death or the near impossibility of an agonizing climb for life. A story of heart-stopping adventure, heartfelt friendship, fleeting mortality, and implacable nature, <i>The Ledge</i> chronicles the elation and grief, dizzying heights and punishing depths, of a journey to hard-won wisdom.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;Plunges readers into a dark, icy chasm from which escape seems impossible.

Tabor</strong> earned an MFA from Johns Hopkins University and is a former Contributing Editor to </em>Outside<em> and </em>SKI Magazines<em>. His writing has also appeared in </em>TIME<em>, </em>The Wall Street Journal<em>, </em>The Washington Post<em>, </em>Smithsonian<em>, </em>Barron's<em>, and many other national magazines. He was the writer and host of the national PBS series, </em>The Great Outdoors<em> and in 2007 was the co-creator and Executive Producer for the History Channel Special, </em>Journey to the Center of the World<em>. His first book was the international-award-winning </em>Forever on the Mountain<em> (2007) and his most recent was </em>Blind Descent.<em> A former Washington, DC police officer, Tabor now lives in Vermont where he is at work on his first novel, </em>The Deep Zone. <p>On June 21, 1992, Jim Davidson, 29, and his best friend and climbing partner, Mike Price, 34, summited 14,410-foot Mt. Rainier via the challenging Liberty Ridge route. While descending, Davidson plunged into an 80-foot-deep crevasse and pulled his rope-partner Price in, too. Price died, Davidson survived, and <em>The Ledge</em> is Davidson&#x2019;s painstakingly detailed account of their accident, written 19 years <em>post facto</em>.</p> <p>Hundreds of books have described climbing tragedies in such detail. Two things set the best apart. One is the attempt to look beyond obvious vagaries of gear, weather, and happenstance to discover tragedy&#x2019;s true, dark roots. The other is an equally strong determination to bring something of value back from the brink. These are much harder quests and, to his credit, Davidson tackles both.</p> <p>That detail, first. Davidson recreates the fatal fall and aftermath as though they happened yesterday, thanks to hours of recollections tape-recorded shortly after the event. That&#x2019;s important, because on one level, such the success of such narratives depends on details as sharp as ice shards. An example will suffice. After he hit bottom, buried beneath and completely immobilized by cascading snow and ice, Davidson could not breathe.</p> <p><em>I suck in hard, trying to grab a breath, but my mouth is half-filled with crunchy snow, so I pull in only a small gulp of air. I try chewing the snow to clear it away, but it is too much, as if someone has stuffed a Popsicle into my mouth. I work my jaw and tongue, struggling to push out the rapidly hardening snow clump. But it turns into a dense lump the size of a plum. When I rest for a second, the snowball settles back in my throat and gags me. </em></p> <p>Having had no chance to save his friend, Davidson had to save himself by climbing out of the crevasse, and the odds against him were long. Davidson was injured, exhausted, and probably in shock. He lacked both the requisite technical aid-climbing experience and most of the proper gear. But he drew strength from recollections of Joe Simpson&#x2019;s against-all-odds self-rescue in <em>Touching the Void</em>. After many hours of struggle, Davidson finally climbed back to the surface. Even then, the ordeal was far from over. It was late and getting dark. He was hurt and had no gear and was alone on a glacier riddled with more crevasses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m out, but I&#x2019;m not safe,&#x201d; Davidson acknowledged.</p> <p>That turned out to be true in more ways than one. Though he survived and eventually recovered physically, Davidson continued to suffer from psychic injuries, survivor&#x2019;s guilt chief among them. In his journal, he wrote, &#x201c;How am I to carry this load alone--the self-doubt, the endless questioning? How can I hope to carry it alone?&#x201d; Mike Price haunted his thoughts and dreams and, laudably, Davidson eschewed the more common rites of exorcism: chemical, alcohol, and compensatory self-sacrifice. Instead, over the months, he went <em>mano a mano</em> with every painful &#x201c;what if&#x201d; and found his measure of solace:</p> <p><em>Each decision, action, and bit of luck is a fork leading to different outcomes, different branches. Some are sturdy and hold fast, some creak under your weight, some fracture and drop you into unexpected turmoil.</em></p> <p>Not perfect, perhaps, but certainly good enough to live with.</p> <p>Making personal peace with the tragedy was good, but left missing one last arc in the circle of healing. Could something of value be distilled from all the loss and agony? As it turned out, yes. &#x201c;While I was in the crevasse, Joe Simpson&#x2019;s survival tale convinced me that there was a remote chance to escape, and that belief helped spur me to action. Perhaps I have an obligation to share my story...&#x201d;</p> <p>After securing permission from Mike Price&#x2019;s parents, Davidson spoke to his first live audience in September, 2003 at the annual Rainier Mountain Festival. Afterward, among the many grateful listeners was a middle-aged mother with two daughters. &#x201c;I wanted them to hear it,&#x201d; she told Davidson. &#x201c;Now if they&#x2019;re in an accident...they&#x2019;ll know how much people can do, that we can do incredible things if we try our hardest.&#x201d; And with that, the circle was complete. Since then, according to his publisher, Davidson has delivered his message to more than 30,000 people. <em>The Ledge</em> is part of his ongoing commitment to Mike Price--and to himself--to find meaning in the heart of tragedy.</p> <p>Someone once said that for true value, &#x201c;a book must be about more than it is about.&#x201d; Jim Davidson&#x2019;s <em>The Ledge</em> is. You can read it as a thrilling, chilling tale of adventure and death in the mountains, but it is, ultimately, about more than that. As, come to think of it, are climbing and mountains themselves.</p> <p></p><b>Jim Davidson</b> is an accomplished climber, speaker, and science writer.

Explore functional programming without the academic overtones (tell me about monads just one more time). Create concurrent applications, butget them right without all the locking and consistency headaches. Meet Elixir, a modern, functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir's pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interestedfor the long haul. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it's Elixir.</p> <p>Functional programming techniques help you manage the complexities of today's real-world, concurrent systems; maximize uptime; and manage security. Enter Elixir, with its modern, Ruby-like, extendable syntax, compile and runtime evaluation, hygienic macro system, and more. But, just as importantly, Elixir brings a sense of enjoyment to parallel,functional programming. Your applications become fun to work with, and the language encourages you to experiment.</p> <p>Part 1 covers the basics of writing sequential Elixir programs. We'll look at the language, the tools, and the conventions. Part 2 uses these skills to start writing concurrent code-applications that use all the cores on your machine, or all the machines on your network! And we do it both with and without OTP. Part 3 looks at the more advanced features of the language, from DSLs and code generation to extending the syntax.</p> <p>This edition is fully updated with all the new features of Elixir 1.6, with a new chapter on structuring OTP applications, and new sections on the debugger, code formatter, Distillery, and protocols.</p> <p><b>What You Need:</b></p> <p>You'll need a computer, a little experience with another high-levellanguage, and a sense of adventure. No functional programmingexperience is needed.</p></p><p><p><b>Dave Thomas</b>, is a programmer who likes to evangelize cool stuff.

When Giordano moved to DC, O'Neil soon followed. At DC, O'Neil scripted several series for Giordano and Julius Schwartz, quickly becoming one of the most respected writers in comics. O'Neil earned a reputation for being able to "revamp" such characters as Superman, Green Lantern, Captain Marvel -- and Batman, whom O'Neil (with the help of Neal Adams and Giordano) brought back to his roots as a dark, mysterious, gothic avenger. Besides being the most important Batman writer of the 1970s, O'Neil served as an editor at both Marvel and DC. After a long tenure as Group Editor of the Batman line of titles, he retired to write full-time.<br><br>Born on June 15, 1941 in New York City, Neal Adams began his comics career immediately after high school and has worked in the field ever since. He joined DC Comics in 1965, where he quickly became one of their top cover artists, contributing radical and dynamic illustrations to nearly every title the company published. His first interior work was done for editor Robert Kanigher's war titles, but it was his celebrated run on a new title called DEADMAN that began to build his reputation as a revolutionary creative force. In addition to his pivotal artistic and business roles, Adams has also been an outspoken supporter of creators' rights in the comics industry and was influential in convincing comic book publishers to return original artwork to the artists who created it.</p><h2>Raising My Rainbow: Adventures in Raising a Fabulous, Gender Creative Son</h2><p><b><i>Raising My Rainbow </i>is Lori Duron&#x2019;s frank, heartfelt, and&nbsp;brutally funny&nbsp;account of her and her family's adventures of distress and happiness raising a gender-creative son. </b><br><br>Whereas her older son, Chase, is a Lego-loving, sports-playing boy's boy, Lori's younger son, C.J., would much rather twirl around in a pink sparkly tutu, with a Disney Princess in each hand while singing Lady Gaga's "Paparazzi."<br><br>C.J. is gender variant or gender nonconforming, whichever you prefer.

Duron lives with her husband and two children in a happy, messy home in Orange County, California.Chapter 1<br><br>My five-year-old son, C.J., is ready for school. He&#x2019;s wearing his favorite pink-and-white striped polo shirt and khaki shorts. His teeth are brushed and so is his short auburn hair. He&#x2019;s standing in front of the full-length mirror in my bedroom, where he feels close to me, as I get dressed for work. I brush my brown hair, create a side part, and pull it back into a low ponytail. He pretend-braids his imaginary long blonde hair and ties a bow at the end. I slip on silver hoop earrings and fasten them. He pretends to do the same. I zip up the back of my dress as he slides on a few revolutions of imaginary lipstick. I put on my black high heels and he straightens his imaginary tiara. I give myself a spritz of perfume as he arrives beside me and puffs out his chest. I give him a pretend spray or two. I grab my computer bag, he grabs his Monster High lunch box, and we head out the door--he to kindergarten and I to the office.<br><br>As we part ways for the day, I say to him, &#x201c;I love you no matter what.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the absolute truth. There are no conditions or expectations. I love him no matter what.<br><br>Hours later, I load my smiling son into the car. As I drive home, he pulls papers out of his folder to show me. He holds up a worksheet on which he has been practicing writing the letter B. &#x201c;B is for Bear,&#x201d; the worksheet says. C.J. colored his bear pink and purple with long blonde hair, hoop earrings, red lipstick, and long pink fingernails.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, Mommy, my bear&#x2019;s fingernails match my fingernails!&#x201d; he squeals in giddy delight, kicking his feet, which dangle down from his booster seat, his pink polka-dot Minnie Mouse socks peeking out from his mint green tennis shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;They sure do,&#x201d; I say as I stop at a traffic light and turn to smile at my special boy. His pink glitter fingernails sparkle in the sun as he holds them next to his bear&#x2019;s fingernails for me to compare and admire.<br><br>&#x201c;I picked the color special. My teacher said we could color the bear any colors we wanted. I made sure I asked. I didn&#x2019;t want to color mine brown like real bears. Brown is boring,&#x201d; he says. I will learn later that all of the other kids colored their bears traditional colors like white, brown, and black. My son has always shied away from the traditional, the &#x201c;boring.&#x201d;<br><br>When we get home, C.J. dashes up the stairs to his Monster High&#x2013;themed bedroom to change out of his school clothes and into his pink Hello Kitty skirt and white lace tank top. Every day I can almost hear and feel him exhale when he changes out of his &#x201c;school clothes&#x201d; and into his &#x201c;dress-up clothes.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s as if, for the first time all day, he is truly comfortable. He clips on his pink rhinestone butterfly earrings and, as he flits down the stairs holding a Barbie doll, I catch a glimpse of his Superman boxer briefs.<br><br>As I cook dinner, he helps himself to a fresh piece of white paper and sketches what looks like a girl with long red hair, full pink lips in the shape of a puffy heart, a blue dress, rainbow tights, red shoes, a purple tiara, hazel green eyes, and a dozen freckles that rest on the bridge of her feminine nose. I don&#x2019;t have to ask who the girl in the picture is; I know that it is my son. I&#x2019;d recognize him anywhere.<br><br>C.J. is gender nonconforming, gender creative, gender fluid, gender independent, gender variant, has gender identity disorder, or whatever you prefer to call it. For more than half of his life, my son hasn&#x2019;t conformed to traditional gender norms. As C.J. explains it, he&#x2019;s &#x201c;a boy who likes girl stuff and wants to be treated like a girl.&#x201d;<br><br>My firstborn son, Chase, arrives home from flag football practice, bounding through the door, dropping his backpack in the middle of the kitchen floor as he moves toward the fridge for a snack. As I tell him that dinner is almost ready and snacking is not an option, I kiss the top of his head. He is sweaty and smells like elementary school and pigskin practice--a mix of playground, lunch, number-two pencils, leather, and wet grass.<br><br>Chase is all boy and always has been. He&#x2019;s like his dad in that respect. My husband, Matt, is my high-school sweetheart and has been for more than eighteen years. He&#x2019;s an Irishman with a heart of gold hidden underneath his tough-guy facade and ever-present scowl. He has delicious strawberry blonde hair, light blue eyes, and broad, strong shoulders. He&#x2019;s a guy&#x2019;s guy with a motorcycle, oversized truck, classic car, pool table, dartboard, and kegerator.<br><br>Matt and I thought, when we had a second boy, that we would just get more of the same, that when Chase finished a particular phase or stage, C.J. would enter it and we&#x2019;d do it all over again. We thought wrong.<br><br>We thought that our two boys might have slightly different interests. One might like baseball more, while the other preferred soccer. One might like LEGOs, while the other preferred Hot Wheels. We anticipated that their taste in &#x201c;boy things&#x201d; might differ slightly. What we didn&#x2019;t anticipate was that one of our boys might like &#x201c;girl toys,&#x201d; &#x201c;girl clothes,&#x201d; and hanging out with girls in general. We never, in a million years, thought that we would have a boy who was a girl at heart.<br><br>On the gender-variation spectrum of super-macho-masculine on the left all the way to super-girly-feminine on the right, C.J. slides fluidly in the middle; he&#x2019;s neither all pink nor all blue. He&#x2019;s a muddled mess or a rainbow creation, depending on how you look at it. Matt and I have decided to see the rainbow, not the muddle. But we didn&#x2019;t always see it that way.<br><br>Initially, the sight of our son playing with girl toys or wearing girl clothes made our chests tighten, forged a lump in our throats, and, at times, made us want to hide him. There was anger, anxiety, and fear. We&#x2019;ve evolved as parents as our youngest son has evolved into a fascinating, vibrant person who is creative with gender. Sometimes, when I think of how we behaved as parents early in C.J.&#x2019;s gender nonconformity, I&#x2019;m ashamed and embarrassed.<br>Chapter 2<br><br>It was like watching somebody come alive, watching a flower bloom, watching a rainbow cross the sky. It was the day that C.J. discovered Barbie. He was two and a half years old.<br><br>One late fall afternoon, as I was doing some cleaning, I found a boxed Barbie in the depths of my closet and tossed her on my bed.<br><br>&#x201c;WHAT DAT?!&#x201d;<br><br>I wobbled and nearly fell off my stepladder at C.J.&#x2019;s shriek.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Barbie,&#x201d; I said, regaining my balance.<br><br>This particular Barbie was pretty fabulous. It was Mattel&#x2019;s 50th Anniversary Bathing Suit Barbie. She was a modernized version of the original 1959 doll, with a two-piece, black-and-white bikini trimmed with her signature color pink; pink hoop earrings; a long blonde ponytail; and a pink cell phone.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to open she!&#x201d; C.J. declared.<br><br>He held the box as he jumped up and down, up and down, up and down. I&#x2019;m sure he gave Barbie a concussion. I hesitated. I had been trained well by my mother; you don&#x2019;t open a boxed Barbie if you can at all help it. I was a little annoyed; I was going to open the box and take Barbie out, and my son was going to play with her for a few seconds and move on to something else bright and shiny. Then I&#x2019;d be left with a depreciated piece of plastic. But his face, his sweet excited face could convince me to do worse things. We opened her.<br><br>In that instant, our lives changed forever in a way that we never expected. In our family&#x2019;s history there is now B.B. (Before Barbie) and A.B. (After Barbie). Never underestimate the power of an eleven-and-a-half-inch woman.<br><br>Of course, at that exact moment, I wasn&#x2019;t aware that our lives were changing. I couldn&#x2019;t have predicted the magnitude of C.J.&#x2019;s actions or mine. I figured that C.J. would play with Barbie for a day, maybe two, and lose interest--as he had with all of the other toys he had encountered in his short life. I was wrong; Barbie has been a constant in his life since that day. Oh, my son wasn&#x2019;t dabbling; he was hard-core from the start. C.J. had found his life&#x2019;s passion--and he wasn&#x2019;t even three.<br><br>Matt arrived home from work at the police department to spy a big-busted blonde in his youngest son&#x2019;s grip. He shot me a look that said, What the hell is that? I replied with a glance that whispered, Settle down. We&#x2019;ll talk about it later.<br><br>Matt changed out of his uniform and sat on the living room floor next to C.J., who was sitting criss-cross-applesauce and trying his hardest to put clothes back on a naked Barbie.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you got there, buddy?&#x201d; Matt asked C.J.<br><br>C.J.&#x2019;s eyes lit up and a huge grin crossed his face as he excitedly described the doll in great detail to his father. I smiled from my spot at the kitchen sink.<br><br>Later that night, after C.J. and Chase were asleep, Matt shared with me the unease he&#x2019;d felt when he saw his son playing with a doll. Having grown up with no sisters, he&#x2019;d never even had a Barbie in his house before and couldn&#x2019;t remember ever touching one. It didn&#x2019;t feel right to him, though it didn&#x2019;t feel completely wrong either. After all, C.J. was just a child and Barbie was just a toy.<br><br>It was the first of thousands of conversations we&#x2019;ve had in the privacy of our bedroom late at night as we&#x2019;ve tried to figure out how best to parent a boy who, at times, is clearly more girl.<br><br>&#x201c;My brother played with Barbies,&#x201d; I reasoned with Matt, reminding myself and trying to squash the indescribable feelings of unease we were flirting with. &#x201c;And he turned out fine.&#x201d;<br><br>Matt gave me a look that expanded on my last sentence. Fine and gay.<br><br>Of course C.J.&#x2019;s zeal for Barbie reminded me of my brother, Michael.<br><br>My brother and I had a bad Barbie habit as kids. While other kids we knew were committed to karate, baseball, piano, and dance, we were committed to playing with Barbies. We did it all the time, just as I assumed all brothers and sisters did. I didn&#x2019;t realize until much later in life that my family&#x2019;s definition of &#x201c;normal&#x201d; was different from other families&#x2019;.<br><br>On any given weekend Michael and I would convert the entire floor of the front family room into a fabulous world for our Barbies. There was a wardrobe area and a styling area for accessories, hair, and makeup. We arranged the miniature furniture to create a spacious four-bedroom, one-story, ranch-style home, since we weren&#x2019;t fortunate enough to possess the Dream House or even the Malibu Beach House. We convinced ourselves that ours was way better anyway, because it was custom-built, our lot size was bigger, and we could keep our brown plastic horse in our backyard.<br><br>Sometimes we&#x2019;d create a mall, and our Barbies, Kens, Skippers, and Midges would all go shopping and eat in the food court, where some one-off Barbie who had suffered some sort of disfigurement (such as a bad haircut, a lost limb, or general disrepair) would take their order and serve them lunch from Hot Dog on a Stick.<br><br>I called my brother.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess what C.J. found when I was cleaning out my closet?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Your vibrator?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, you idiot, he found one of my Barbies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You still have Barbies?! How come you never get them out when I come over?&#x201d; he said, his feelings genuinely hurt, as if I sat my thirtysomething-year-old ass around playing Barbies all day every day and then hid them when he visited.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one Barbie. Mom just gave it to me. It&#x2019;s the fiftieth-anniversary Barbie,&#x201d; I said, trying to get to the point.<br><br>&#x201c;How come she didn&#x2019;t get me one? This is just like when we were kids; you always got the Barbies and I didn&#x2019;t. I got footballs. I hate footballs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about you. C.J. found the Barbie and loves her. He&#x2019;s obsessed,&#x201d; I explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; my brother said quietly. &#x201c;What do you think it means?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said, although I knew exactly what I thought it meant: my two-and-a-half-year-old son was gay.<br>Chapter 3<br><br>For days after C.J. discovered her, Barbie never left his side. When I&#x2019;d do a final bed check at night before I retired for the evening to watch reality television and sneak chocolate when no one was looking, I&#x2019;d see his full head of auburn hair sticking out above his covers. Next to him there would be a tiny tuft of blonde hair sticking out as well.<br><br>The next time we were at Target and near the toy aisle--which I&#x2019;ve always tried to pass at warp speed so the kids don&#x2019;t notice and beg me to buy them something--C.J. wanted to see &#x201c;Barbie stuff.&#x201d; I led him to the appropriate aisle and he stood there transfixed, not touching a thing, just taking it all in. He was so overwhelmed that he didn&#x2019;t ask to buy a single thing. He finally walked away from the aisle speechless, as if he had just seen something so magical and majestic that he needed time to process it.<br><br>He had, that day, discovered the pink aisles of the toy department. We had never been down those aisles; we had only frequented the blue aisles, when we ventured down the toy aisles at all. As far as C.J. was concerned, I had been hiding half of the world from him.<br><br>I felt bad about that, like I had deprived him because of my assumptions and expectations that he was a boy and boys liked boy things. Matt and I had noticed that C.J. didn&#x2019;t really like any of the toys we provided for him, which were all handed down from his brother. We noticed that C.J. didn&#x2019;t go through the normal boy toy addictions that Chase had gone through: he couldn&#x2019;t care less about balls, cars, dinosaurs, superheroes, The Wiggles, Bob the Builder, or Thomas the Tank Engine. What did he like to play with? We didn&#x2019;t worry ourselves much about finding the answer (a case of the second-born child not getting fussed over quite like the firstborn); we trusted that in time something would draw him in. Which it did. It just wasn&#x2019;t at all what we were expecting.<br><br>At about the eighteen to twenty-four-month mark of a child&#x2019;s life, the gender-neutral toys disappear and toys that are marketed specifically to boys or to girls take over. We didn&#x2019;t realize it until later, but that divide in the toy world and our house being filled with only boy toys left C.J. a little lost at playtime. We and the rest of society had been pushing masculine stuff on him and enforcing traditional gender norms, when all he wanted was to brush long blonde hair and dress, undress, and re-dress Barbie, occasionally rubbing her boobs for comfort as some rub a rabbit&#x2019;s foot for good luck.</p><h2>The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs</h2><p><p> Does America, as George W. Bush has proclaimed, have a special mission, derived from God, to bring liberty and democracy to the world? How much influence does the Christian right have over U.S. foreign policy? And how should America deal with violent Islamist extremists? </p> <p> Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state and bestselling author of <i>Madam Secretary</i>, offers a thoughtful and often surprising look at the role of religion in shaping America's approach to the world. Drawing upon her experiences while in office and her own deepest beliefs about morality, the United States, and the present state of world affairs, a woman noted for plain speaking offers her thoughts about the most controversial topics of our time. </p></p><p><p>Madeleine Albright served as America&#x2019;s sixty-fourth secretary of state from 1997 to 2001.&nbsp; Her distinguished career also in-cludes positions at the White House, on Capitol Hill, and as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.&nbsp; She is a resident of Washington D.C., and Virginia.</p>After 9/11, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright decided to examine the role of religion in modern politics. THE MIGHTY &amp; THE ALMIGHTY is the interesting result. Albright's experience as a public speaker and professor is evident in this eminently listenable audiobook. While one wishes that she had audibly smiled when reading the book's humorous anecdotes, she does everything else right. She makes good use of her modulated, pleasantly raspy voice, varying her tone and rhythm to lighten the dense information and pacing the narration so that listeners have time to digest the material. An informative author interview is an added benefit at the end. This is an excellent production of a timely volume.

His program, The Michael Savage Show, airs on four hundred radio stations coast to coast (including WOR in New York and KNEW in San Francisco) and enjoys ten million weekly listeners, the nation&#39;s third largest talk radio audience. A man of the people, Savage has labored as a factory worker, teacher, social worker, medicinal plant explorer, and biologist, earning master&#39;s degrees in both medical botany and medical anthropology and a Ph.D. in epidemiology and nutrition science from the University of California at Berkeley. He is the founder and director of the Paul Revere Society, which supports our nation&#39;s right to defend and protect its borders, language, and culture.On his nationally syndicated radio show, Michael Savage's rhetoric makes Rush Limbaugh seem tame in comparison. Savage's style is memorable, provocative, and inimitable. Reader Mark Warner clearly understands Savage's style and seeks to represent it as closely as possible. Warner comes close to capturing Savage's outrage, irony, and humor, but he doesn't capture it completely. Nevertheless, Warner's reading is clear and even-paced. As for the text, Savage offers his views on a wide range of issues, from the war on terrorism ("We need more Patton and less patent leather") to why the American people, whom he regularly calls "sheeple," are so gullible. M.L.C. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Flicker: A Novel (2) (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p>From the golden age of art movies and underground cinema to X-rated porn, splatter films, and midnight movies, this breathtaking thriller is a tour de force of cinematic fact and fantasy, full of metaphysical mysteries that will haunt the dreams of every moviegoer. Jonathan Gates could not have anticipated that his student studies would lead him to uncover the secret history of the movies&#x2014;a tale of intrigue, deception, and death that stretches back to the 14th century. But he succumbs to what will be a lifelong obsession with the mysterious Max Castle, a nearly forgotten genius of the silent screen who later became the greatest director of horror films, only to vanish in the 1940s, at the height of his talent. Now, 20 years later, as Jonathan seeks the truth behind Castle's disappearance, the innocent entertainments of his youth&#x2014;the sexy sirens, the screwball comedies, the high romance&#x2014;take on a sinister appearance. His tortured quest takes him from Hollywood's Poverty Row into the shadowy lore of ancient religious heresies. He encounters a cast of exotic characters, including Orson Welles and John Huston, who teach him that there's more to film than meets the eye, and journeys through the dark side of nostalgia, where the Three Stooges and Shirley Temple join company with an alien god whose purposes are anything but entertainment.<br></p><p><b>Theodore Roszak</b> was a professor of history at California State University&#x2013;Hayward and the author of 18 books, including the international bestseller <i>The Making of a Counter Culture.</i> He has twice been nominated for the National Book Award. His articles have appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, and <i>Harper's</i>. Roszak died in July 2011.<br>This latest effort by the author of the seminal The Making of the Counterculture is a quirky, sexy, sprawling novel that comprises, among other things, a magical mystery tour of the history of cinema, an acid satire on Hollywood and what passes for today's cultural avant-garde, a metaphysical puzzle, an exploration of the psychological impact of films and a parable about the modern spiritual wasteland. UCLA film scholar and critic Jonathan Gates becomes obsessed with legendary German expressionist filmmaker Max Castle, who went to Hollywood in the mid-1920s and whose vampire and ghoul B-movies are viewed by cult fans as deeply troubling evocations of evil. On the trail of Castle's dark past, Gates and his ex-girlfriend, tough-minded film critic Clare Swann, encounter medieval gnostic heresies, secret societies, a teenage genius albino movie producer and an aged Dutch ex-vamp who practices tantric-like sex. Crammed with film lore that will regale cinema buffs, the narrative segues from its realistic beginning into a bizarre, apocalyptic fantasy that eventually spins off the reel, illuminating in the end only a very private, muddled vision. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>US Super Carrier: All makes and models * Insights into the design, departments, flight operations and daily life of the US Navy&#39;s greatest warships (Operations Manual)</h2><p>The US Navy&#x2019;s fleet of aircraft carriers are at the heart of global American military force.

In explaining this important doctrine, Sergius Bulgakov begins by surveying the field of Christology with special reference to the divine humanity. He considers the role of the Divine Sophia, examines the foundations of the Incarnation, explores the nature of Christ's divine consciousness, and ponders Christ's ministries while on earth. A profound discussion of Christ's&nbsp;<i>kenosis</i>&nbsp;as a model for humanity rounds out this comprehensive and valuable study.<br><br><i>The Lamb of God</i>&nbsp;is one of the greatest works of Christology in the twentieth century and a crowning achievement in the examination of the theology of divine humanity.</p><p>Sergius Bulgakov (1871-1944) is widely regarded as the twentieth century's leading Orthodox theologian.<br><br>Boris Jakim is the foremost translator of Russian religiousthought into English. His published translations includeworks by S.L. Frank, Pavel Florensky, Vladimir Solovyov,and Sergius Bulgakov.<b>David Bentley Hart</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Beauty of the Infinite</i><br> "This book is quite simply the most remarkable and impressive work of Christology produced in the twentieth century, and its appearance in English is long overdue. In Bulgakov's vision of Divine-Humanity, the inner coherence of the doctrines of Incarnation and of the transformation of human beings in Christ becomes startlingly visible, in a way both deeply grounded in patristic tradition and profoundly original."<br><br><b>John Chryssavgis</b><br> &#x2014; editor of&nbsp;<i>Cosmic Grace, Humble Prayer</i><br> "The mystery of the christological doctrine inevitably involves traversing waters that are difficult to chart. Yet few people could ever perceive dimensions or discern connections in classic theological formulations as Fr. Sergius Bulgakov did. His creative and imaginative vision &#x2014; despite philosophical controversy or ecclesiastical suspicion &#x2014; was well before and beyond his time. In&nbsp;<i>The Lamb of God</i>&nbsp;Bulgakov develops his unique intellectual argument with the subtle, sacred, and humble art of a skilled iconographer."<br><br><b>Paul Valliere</b><br> &#x2014; Butler University<br> "<i>The Lamb of God</i>&nbsp;is the first volume of Bulgakov's trilogy&nbsp;<i>On Divine-Humanity</i>, the most ambitious and intellectually generous work of Orthodox dogmatic theology in modern times. The theme of this volume is the incarnation and&nbsp;<i>kenosis</i>&nbsp;(self-emptying) of the Word, which Bulgakov explicates from a vast ecclesial and cosmic perspective. But the pleasures of reading Bulgakov are more than intellectual. On page after page the reader can sense the passion and piety of a Christian who is awestruck at the miracle of the Gospel. . . Something else to marvel at here is the achievement of the translator, Boris Jakim, who with this book completes his gift of Bulgakov's dogmatic theology to the English-speaking world. Jakim's devotion to his craft and the degree of difficulty of the works he has dispatched are unsurpassed in the annals of scholarly translation in any discipline."</p><h2>Letting Go of Your Past (Transformation)</h2><p><p>The third book in The Transformation Series, this sequel to Transforming the Inner Man and God's Power to Change focuses on relationships and events that disable us from being able to relate and communicate with others effectively.

It is a complete, practical guide to eating for good health.</li></p><p>As Hippocrates said, "Leave your drugs in the chemist's pot if you can heal the patient with food." Seems people didn't listen to him, because as the U.S. Surgeon General said more than 2,000 years after him, "Two-thirds of all deaths in 1997 in this country could be attributed to diet." They'd both likely advocate the information contained in <i>Prescription for Dietary Wellness</i>, a massive reference aimed at preventing and treating disease through diet. The Balchs, authors of the 3-million-plus bestseller <i>Prescription for Nutritional Healing</i>, which focuses mainly on supplements and herbs, have created another masterpiece. This book gives a solid education in nutrition basics, with references to the latest research. It also includes flavorful, antioxidant-packed recipes, and adds advice that has been proven effective for treating various ailments using specific foods and supplements. The book also includes: <ul><li>Charts with warning signs of disease and nutrient deficiency, along with guidelines to help start the healing process </li><li>Charts that detail the nutrient needs of various organs, and which foods best supply the nutrients </li><li>Lengthy chapters on specific categories of foods, such as beans, cruciferous vegetables, oils, and grains, explaining how best to cook them and the health benefits they confer </li><li>More than 100 pages of quick, healthy, mostly low-fat recipes designed to pack the most nutritional punch for the calories</li></ul> The Balchs add advice about live juice and herbal preparations and cleansing (i.e., fasting and enemas, including a specific six-day cleansing diet). While this guide can feel a bit overwhelming at times (there are so many nutrients to consider, so many veggies and whole grains to consume), it's certainly not too technical, even for folks who could use a copy of <i>Nutrition for Dummies</i>, and it certainly succeeds in its mission of helping foster better dietary habits for good health.Phyllis Balch was author of the bestselling <b>Prescription for Nutritional Healing</b>, as well as of <b>Prescription for Nutritional Healing: The A-to-Z Guide to Supplements</b>, and <b>Prescription for Herbal Healing</b>.</p><h2>Laika</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. From the dog&#39;s point of view, follows the adventures of the dog sent into space by the Soviet Union.</p><p>Laika was the abandoned puppy destined to become Earth's first space traveler. This is her journey. <p>Nick Abadzis masterfully blends fiction and fact in the intertwined stories of three compelling lives. Along with Laika, there is Korolev, once a political prisoner, now a driven engineer at the top of the Soviet space program, and Yelena, the lab technician responsible for Laika's health and life. This intense triangle is rendered with the pitch-perfect emotionality of classics like <i>Because of Winn Dixie</i>, <i>Shiloh</i>, and <i>Old Yeller</i>. Abadzis gives life to a pivotal moment in modern history, casting light on the hidden moments of deep humanity behind history. Laika's story will speak straight to your heart. </p><p> <strong>Questions for Nick Abadzis</strong> </p><p> <strong>Jeff VanderMeer for Amazon.com:</strong> What inspired you to pick this particular topic for a graphic novel? And why, for example, a graphic novel as opposed to a strictly written account? </p><p> <strong>Abadzis:</strong> I'd known it was a good story since I was about six years old. It had always been at the back of my mind as a story to tell. In 2002, new information came to light about the Sputnik II mission and specifically Laika's death. That was the spark, although back then I envisaged something much shorter. It, uh, grew. Why a graphic novel? Well, comics are my language. It's the medium that I'm most familiar and comfortable...so it was first choice. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What most surprised you while researching Laika? </p><p> <strong>Abadzis:</strong> There were a few things. I had no idea there were so few Soviet engineers and scientists involved in the nascent space program--not to trivialize their incredible achievement but, in many senses, they just winged it, borne along in great part by Korolev's force of will and political maneuvering. Also it was interesting to find out how much the Soviet scientists cared for their cosmodogs. Events conspired to make Laika a sacrificial passenger on board Sputnik II, but they really did honor their canine cosmonauts. There's even a statue of Laika in Moscow. Perhaps this book will go some small way to re-establishing her position in history: whatever the circumstances, and whether you agree with what they did or not, she was the first earthling in orbit around this planet. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Was there anything that didn't make it into the graphic novel because it just didn't fit? </p><p> <strong>Abadzis:</strong> There was quite a bit, actually. I could have done with another hundred pages. But I'd taken a bit of time to write and thumbnail it (which I do at the same time) and when that stage was finished, the publisher and I realized that the 50th anniversary of the Sputnik launches was fast approaching. When I first pitched the idea to Mark Siegel at First Second, neither of us realized that it was so close. It felt like we needed to be a part of that, so I drew it extremely fast--two hundred pages in a little over eight months. It's an understatement to say that it was extremely hard work. What got left out was a longer explication of Laika's origins; the scenes with Mikhail, her first owner were much longer.... Originally, I did have an idea of doing three books: Laika would be the first, Gagarin the second, and a full-on comic strip biography of Korolev [the driven engineer on the project] would be the final part that would bind together events seen in the first two. Maybe one day. Certainly, elements of Korolev's life that I felt were important to the story made it into the final version of the book. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Did you worry about the sentimentality inherent in the situation? How did that affect your decisions in creating the graphic novel? </p><p> <strong>Abadzis:</strong> I suppose it would have been easy to make it another cutesy, twee, and overly saccharine dead-dog story but that wouldn't have been true either to my taste or to the socio-political system and culture I was attempting to portray. Laika--the real Laika--was a cute dog, as photographs attest. There's no getting away from it, and there's plenty of evidence to suggest her owners thought so, too. I didn't want to anthropomorphize her, at least not to the extent that she was spouting speech/thought balloons like, say Tintin's Snowy (which works just fine for those books). Having made that decision--which I didn't really feel was an option, in any case--I knew that to really do it justice, I'd have to do a lot of research. The sentiment of the story, such as it is, would take care of itself and be implicit in certain character's actions or words (or not, as the case may be).... All that said, it'd be disingenuous to suggest that, in dealing with a true story that involves dogs and their owners (even if they happen to be scientists in a Soviet cosmodog program), there wouldn't be a bit of emotion. There's plenty (and I hope the reader feels it). But there's also the harsh reality of the time, the place and the confluence of events that put Laika into space. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What are you currently working on? </p><p> <strong>Abadzis:</strong> I'm currently working on a new graphic novel for older readers called <i>Skin Trouble</i>, which is also for First Second. I'll leave it to your imagination as to what that's all about, suffice to say it'll be an ensemble piece, character-wise. I've also got a children's graphic novel in the works. Can't say anything about that at all, but I'm looking forward to drawing it. </p><p>Nick Abadzis is a British comics creator whose work has been published across the globe&#x2015;from the U.S. to Japan. He based his book on the true story of the Sputnik 2: there was really a dog named Laika, and she touched the stars before she died. In writing his graphic novel, Nick Abadzis did thorough scientific and historical research, including traveling to Russia, visiting special Sputnik 2 archives, and interviewing experts in the field. He lives in London with his wife and daughter.</p></p><h2>Fashion History: A Global View (Dress, Body, Culture)</h2><p><p><i>Fashion History: A Global View</i> proposes a new perspective on fashion history. Arguing that fashion has occurred in cultures beyond the West throughout history, this groundbreaking book explores the geographic places and historical spaces that have been largely neglected by contemporary fashion studies, bringing them together for the first time.</p><p>Reversing the dominant narrative that privileges Western Europe in the history of dress, Welters and Lillethun adopt a cross-cultural approach to explore a vast array of cultures around the globe. They explore key issues affecting fashion systems, ranging from innovation, production and consumption to identity formation and the effects of colonization. Case studies include the cross-cultural trade of silk textiles in Central Asia, the indigenous dress of the Americas and of Hawai'i, the cosmetics of the Tang Dynasty in China, and stylistic innovation in sub-Saharan Africa. Examining the new lessons that can be deciphered from archaeological findings and theoretical advancements, the book shows that fashion history should be understood as a global phenomenon, originating well before and beyond the fourteenth century European court, which is continually, and erroneously, cited as fashion's birthplace. </p><p> Providing a fresh framework for fashion history scholarship, <i>Fashion History: A Global View</i> will inspire inclusive dress narratives for students and scholars of fashion, anthropology, and cultural studies.</p></p><p><p><b>Linda Welters</b> is Professor of Textiles, Fashion Merchandising and Design and Director of the Graduate Program at the University of Rhode Island, USA. </p><p><b>Abby Lillethun</b> is Associate Professor of Fashion Studies in the Department of Art and Design at Montclair State University, USA.</p></p><h2>Planning Small Groups with Purpose: A Field-Tested Guide to Design and Grow Your Ministry</h2><p>Small groups are a great way to promote the spiritual formation of church attendees.

Now the bestselling author of <b>A Bull in China, Hot Commodities</b>, and <b>Adventure Capitalist</b> shares a heartfelt, indispensable guide for his daughters (and all young investors) to find success and happiness. In <b>A Gift to My Children</b>, Jim Rogers offers advice with his trademark candor and confidence, but this time he adds paternal compassion, protectiveness, and love. Rogers reveals how to learn from his triumphs and mistakes in order to achieve a prosperous, well-lived life. For example:<br><br>� Trust your own judgment: Rogers sensed China&#x2019;s true potential way back in the 1980s, at a time when most analysts were highly skeptical of its prospects for growth.<br>� Focus on what you like: Rogers was five when he started collecting empty bottles at baseball games instead of playing.<br>� Be persistent: Coming to Yale from rural Alabama, and in over his head, Rogers never stopped studying and wound up with a scholarship to Oxford.<br>� See the world: In 1990, Rogers traveled through six continents by motorcycle, gaining a global perspective and learning how to evaluate prospects in rapidly developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China.<br>� Nothing is really new: anything deemed &#x201c;innovative&#x201d; or &#x201c;unprecedented&#x201d; is usually just overhyped, as in the case of the Internet or TV, airplanes, and railroads before it<br>� And not a bit off the subject, and very important: Boys will need you more than you&#x2019;ll need them!<br><br>Wise and warm, accessible and inspiring,<i> </i><b>A Gift to My Children</b> is a great gift for all those just starting to invest in their futures.</p><p>Jim Rogers co-founded the Quantum Fund before he turned 30 and retired at age thirty-seven.

You will find many people ready to offer you advice if you ask for it (and even if you don&#x2019;t), but always remember that the life you lead is yours and nobody else&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s important to decide for yourself what&#x2019;s important to you and what you want before you turn to others. Because while there will be times when outside advice proves wise, there will be at least as many times when it proves utterly useless. The only way to really evaluate other folks&#x2019; advice is to first learn everything that you can about whatever challenge you are facing. Once you&#x2019;ve done that, in most cases you should be able to make an informed decision on your own anyway.<br><br>You were born with the ability to decide what is and what isn&#x2019;t in your best interest. Most of the time, you will make the right decision and take the appropriate actions, and in thinking for yourself, you will become far more successful than had you gone against your own judgment. Believe me, I know.<br><br>Early on in my investment career, I made the mistake of basing a few important business decisions on colleagues&#x2019; opinions instead of conducting the research necessary to make an informed decision. It wasn&#x2019;t due to laziness on my part; no one could ever accuse me of that. But, being new to Wall Street, I tended to assume that my more senior colleagues knew more than I did, and so I attributed too much significance to their opinions. You know what happened? Each of those investments ended in failure. Eventually I stopped allowing myself to be influenced by others and began doing the work myself and making my own decisions. Talk about an epiphany. It took me until I was almost thirty years old to realize this&#x2014;and also to see that it&#x2019;s never too late for a person to change his approach both to business and to life.<br><br>I remember once reading a magazine interview with American swimmer Donna de Varona, winner of two gold medals at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The reporter pointed out that earlier in her career, she had been a good swimmer, but not a great one. Now the seventeen-year-old had just placed first in two four-hundred-meter events. What happened? She replied, &#x201c;I always used to watch the other swimmers, but then I learned to ignore them and swim my own races.&#x201d;<br><i><br>If anybody laughs at your idea, view it as a sign of potential success!</i><br><br>If people around you try to discourage you from taking a certain course of action, or ridicule your ideas, take that as a positive sign. Sure it can be difficult not to run with the herd, but the truth is that most long-term success stories are written by folks who&#x2019;ve done exactly that. Let me give you an example.<br><br>When I was thirty-two years old or so, a Wall Street colleague of mine invited me to join a smart and successful group of financial guys who regularly got together to swap ideas over dinner. At the time, I and a partner were in the early years of our hedge fund called the Quantum Fund. It was a big deal to be invited to these dinners, and, I must admit, I was a little nervous. After all, these were the big guys in my field, and most of them had a great deal more experience than I did.<br><br>We were sitting in the private room of a fancy midtown Manhattan restaurant when the host asked each guest at the table to recommend an investment. Most of them touted so-called growth stocks. When my turn came, I recommended Lockheed, the aerospace company. Once extremely prosperous, by the 1970s it had fallen on hard times. A fellow sitting opposite me smirked and, making sure that I heard him, stage-whispered, &#x201c;Who buys stocks like this? Why buy a bankrupt company?&#x201d;<br><br>About six years later, I ran into this schoolyard bully. I resisted the urge to remind him of his condescending remark. It wasn&#x2019;t easy, given that Lockheed Corporation stock had since increased in value a hundredfold, and for all the reasons that I had explained over dinner: The company shed a huge money-losing division and instead concentrated on the exciting new area of electronic warfare systems. Furthermore, as could have been predicted, defense spending had grown rapidly following a period of decline.<br><br>I had a similar experience with my investments in China. People used to call the country a graveyard for investors, and as recently as the late 1990s, few Westerners invested there. But those who did made a fortune. What did I know that others didn&#x2019;t? Well, back in the 1980s, I sensed China&#x2019;s potential and decided to learn everything I could about it and start investing my money there. Many people told me I was insane; that the rigidly Communist Chinese government would confiscate money earned by successful people, especially outsiders. But I followed my instincts, learned as much as I could about political trends in China, and studied as many documents as I could find. Most valuable of all, I drove across the country&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s a big country&#x2014;several times. Here&#x2019;s what I learned by seeing it with my own eyes:<br><br>China had more than one billion workers, and over one-third of their annual income went into savings. That&#x2019;s astoundingly high. In contrast, the savings rate in the United States was a mere 4 percent. (Today it&#x2019;s just half that, at 2 percent.) Everywhere I traveled, I saw that the capitalism, drive, and entrepreneurship that had characterized China for centuries had at long last reemerged following the failure of Communism. And there was no going back.<br><br>I was struck by how the Chinese people worked from dawn to dusk. In one town, I met a farmer known locally as the &#x201c;Apple King&#x201d; because of his huge orchards. In another town, I talked to a successful restaurateur-hotelier who proudly told me how he&#x2019;d started out by selling bread to farmers as they walked to work every day at dawn. China&#x2019;s cities were full of college kids determined to forge their own futures and enjoy greater prosperity than their parents&#x2019; generation. People were learning English and Japanese instead of Russian; they could see who had the money. Meanwhile, the Western media persisted in referring to the country as &#x201c;Mao Tse-tung&#x2019;s China,&#x201d; even though the Communist dictator had died in 1976. They were blind to the changes taking place&#x2014;and I would have been too, had I not gone there myself and immersed myself in Chinese society. I came away thinking, How could a country like this not grow? Since then, China&#x2019;s economic development has far exceeded not only that of the United States but of nearly every other nation in the world.<br><i><br>Be who you are. Be original! Be bold!</i><br><br>Take a good look at men and women who have been successful in their fields. Now, anyone can get lucky once, but I&#x2019;m talking about people with a sustained record of success. Whether they are artists or musicians, high school teachers or college professors, they all approach their work in a refreshingly original way. This is true of companies too. For example, look at Apple Computer. Steve Jobs and Company refused to accept the conventional wisdom that they would be flattened by the giants IBM and Microsoft. Apple continued to produce high-quality, innovative products and has since been removed from the corporate endangered-species list. In fact, the company is thriving.<br><br>I want you to pursue your own desires and aspirations with that kind of courage and devotion. Your father succeeded as an investor, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that you must be investors too. What I want is for both of you to be your true, original, unique selves.<br><i><br>Above all, be ethical.</i><br><br>As you continue to grow to adulthood, I will continue to offer you guidance. There may be times when I disagree with your choices, but you do not have to accept my advice merely because I am your father. I look at you as independent human beings. Others may say that you are too young to decide for yourselves. I say do what you want, as long as you use your own judgment to determine what is right ethically.<br><br>But while you need not concern yourself with conventional wisdom and other so-called established notions, you must respect and follow the rules, laws, and ethical practices without which society cannot exist. This is expected of everyone. It is not simply the proper way to live, it&#x2019;s the smart way. Honorable people don&#x2019;t find themselves entangled in legal problems, and they always come out on top in the long run. There are smart people who have gotten themselves in serious trouble because they tried to make money the easy way, or sometimes illegally. Had they applied themselves, they probably would have earned even greater profits legally.<br><i><br>Save.</i><br><br>You will meet people who will urge you to spend your money freely; they will tell you, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t take it with you!&#x201d; As you get older, you will probably have friends who eat at expensive restaurants every night, buy the latest gad- gets or fashion trends, and spend vacations at fancy beach resorts. You must avoid the trap of spending money willy-nilly simply because you can. Not only is this a road to financial ruin, it can cause you to forget what&#x2019;s important in life.<br><br>I am not saying that you should never travel or buy anything nice. I am merely suggesting that you should think wisely about whether the thing you are contemplating doing or buying is really worthwhile or whether its benefits will be, at best, fleeting. I was once married to a woman who was always nagging me to buy a new sofa, a new TV, and so on. I&#x2019;d explain that if we saved and invested wisely, one day we could afford ten sofas or whatever. Needless to say, we did not stay married long, and now I am lucky to have your mother, who shares the same attitude toward personal finances.<br><br>Happy, you already have five piggy banks, and you love putting money into them. Please continue to save. Those who save and invest wisely will face fewer financial woes throughout life. And please help us teach your new sister, Baby Bee, the importance of saving.</p><h2>White House Warriors: How the National Security Council Transformed the American Way of War</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;The NSC, part star chamber, part gladiator arena, and part <em>Game of Thrones</em> drama is expertly revealed to us in the pages of Gans&#x2019; primer on Washington power.&#x201d; &#x2015; Kurt Campbell, Chairman of the Asia Group, LLC</strong></p><p>Since its founding more than seventy years ago, the National Security Council has exerted more influence on the president&#x2019;s foreign policy decisions&#x2015;and on the nation&#x2019;s conflicts abroad&#x2015;than any other institution or individual. And yet, until the explosive Trump presidency, few Americans could even name a member.</p><p>&#x201c;A must-read for anyone interested in how Washington really works&#x201d; (Ivo H. Daalder), <em>White House Warriors</em> finally reveals how the NSC evolved from a handful of administrative clerks to, as one recent commander-in-chief called them, the president&#x2019;s &#x201c;personal band of warriors.&#x201d;</p><p>When Congress originally created the National Security Council in 1947, it was intended to better coordinate foreign policy after World War II. Nearly an afterthought, a small administrative staff was established to help keep its papers moving. President Kennedy was, as John Gans documents, the first to make what became known as the NSC staff his own, selectively hiring bright young aides to do his bidding during the disastrous Bay of Pigs operation, the fraught Cuban Missile Crisis, and the deepening Vietnam War.</p><p>Despite Kennedy&#x2019;s death and the tragic outcome of some of his decision, the NSC staff endured. President Richard Nixon handed the staff&#x2019;s reigns solely to Henry Kissinger, who, given his controlling instincts, micromanaged its work on Vietnam. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s NSC was cast into turmoil by overreaching staff members who, led by Oliver North, nearly brought down a presidency in the Iran-Contra scandal. Later, when President George W. Bush&#x2019;s administration was bitterly divided by the Iraq War, his NSC staff stepped forward to write a plan for the Surge in Iraq.</p><p>Juxtaposing extensive archival research with new interviews, Gans demonstrates that knowing the NSC staff&#x2019;s history and its war stories is the only way to truly understand American foreign policy. As this essential account builds to the swift removals of advisors General Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon in 2017, we see the staff&#x2019;s influence in President Donald Trump&#x2019;s still chaotic administration and come to understand the role it might play in its aftermath.</p><p>A revelatory history written with riveting DC insider detail, <em>White House Warriors</em> traces the path that has led us to an era of American aggression abroad, debilitating fights within the government, and whispers about a deep state conspiring against the public.</p> 8 pages of black and white photographs</p><p><strong>John Gans</strong>, PhD, runs the Global Order Program at the University of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Perry World House. A former chief speechwriter at the Pentagon and frequent teacher at John Hopkins University, he lives near Philadelphia.&#x201c;This forceful historical account is a much-needed published assessment, given that NSC members are generally not known to the public. . . . This book is essential reading for all interested in politics, government, and contemporary history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Booklist</i> [starred review]</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is an especially lucid account of how Washington came to deal with the rest of the world, full of lively anecdotes that make the book not just good history but a good read. John Gans is one of the most knowledgeable experts we have on the National Security Council staff, how it works, and how it doesn&#x2019;t. He's studied foreign policy both as a scholar and a public official, and the lessons he learned have gone into this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Mann, author of <i>Rise of the Vulcans</i> and <i>The Obamians</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Serving at the pleasure of the president is a one-of-a-kind experience. With keen insights, deep research, and just the right amount of empathy, John Gans takes us inside the long and sometimes crisis-filled days of some of the lucky few who have worked in the White House. Readers will come away better informed about the successes and setbacks not just of the public servants so adroitly profiled here but the United States itself.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alyssa Mastromonaco, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, New York Times bestselling author, and co-host of the <i>Hysteria</i> podcast</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the White House briefing room, I was often asked about the power of the National Security Council. John Gans was one of my best sources to help explain the ways this unique and elusive institution has served the American president, including the one I worked for. In <em>White House Warriors</em>, Gans proves as good a guide for readers as he was for me, taking all of us inside the staff's daily work as well as the debates and decisions that continue to transform America's relationship with the world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Josh Earnest, former White House Press Secretary</strong><br><br>&#x201c;When it comes to US national security policy, some of the most powerful and consequential people in Washington are also the least well known. John Gans shines a bright light on these National Security Council staffers and shows how they have influenced presidential decisions on war for decades. <em>White House Warriors</em> is must-read for anyone interested in how Washington really works.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ivo H. Daalder, former US Ambassador to NATO and coauthor of <i>In the Shadow of the Oval Office</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the tradition of David Halberstam, John Gans Jr. has provided an essential account of one of Washington's most consequential, but also most misunderstood, working parts.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Graeme Wood, author of <i>The Way of the Strangers: Encounters with the Islamic State</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This insightful and compelling book helps make sense of how the White House&#x2019;s powerful National Security Council staff works and also why it often doesn&#x2019;t&#x2015;sometimes helping presidents make sound foreign policy, but all too frequently getting the policy wrong with terrible human consequences. Richly detailed from interviews with White House staffers, the book disproves Donald Trump&#x2019;s feverish claims of a &#x2018;deep state&#x2019; out to undermine the presidency.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gary J. Bass, author of <i>The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>White House Warriors</em>, John Gans superbly describes how the National Security Council (NSC) &#x2015; the most secretive and powerful institution in the country &#x2015; shapes America&#x2019;s role in the world, particularly during periods of conflict. The NSC, part star chamber, part gladiator arena, and part <em>Game of Thrones</em> drama is expertly revealed to us in the pages of Gans&#x2019; primer on Washington power.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dr. Kurt M. Campbell, Asia Group, LLC and former Obama Administration Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific</strong><br><br>&#x201c;John Gans shows us how the staff of the National Security Council has gradually accumulated or been given extraordinary influence over American national security policy. Sharply critical of this development, the author understands and even admires the people whom he believes have, less through ambition than the abdication of others, inadvertently undermined democratic governance. Controversial, compellingly written, and above all an essential read for anyone who wants to know not only why the United States goes to war, but how.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Eliot Cohen, professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and author of <i>Supreme Command</i></strong></p><h2>Unrelenting Prayer</h2><p>This book helps to explain why God sometimes bears long with His elect, it articulates God&#39;s purpose in the wait, expounds on how justice involves both restoration and restitution, and ignites faith to believe God to avenge us of our adversary. Not only is this message fresh from Bob&#39;s heart, we believe it is a message that is especially relevant to the body of Christ in this final hour.</p><p></p><h2>Fallingwater: The Building of Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s Masterpiece</h2><p><p>In Bear Run, Pennsylvania, a home unlike any other perches atop a waterfall. The water's tune plays differently in each of its sunlight-dappled rooms; the structure itself blends effortlessly into the rock and forest behind it. This is Fallingwater, a masterpiece equally informed by meticulous research and unbounded imagination, designed by the lauded American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. </p><p>This book guides young readers through Wright's process designing Fallingwater, from his initial inspirations to the home's breathtaking culmination. It is a exploration of a man, of dreams, and of the creative process; a celebration of potential. Graceful prose and rich, dynamic illustrations breathe life into the story of Frank and Fallingwater, a man and home utterly unlike any other.</p><p><b>A <i>Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books </i>2017 Blue Ribbon Book</b><br><b>A National Council for the Social Studies Notable Social Studies Trade Book for Young People</b></p></p><p><p><b>Marc Harshman</b>&#x2019;s collection of poems, <i>Believe What You Can</i> (West Virginia University Press), and his thirteenth children&#x2019;s book, <i>One Big Family </i>(Eerdmans), were both published in 2017.

Since the publication of The Joy of Sex in 1972, the sexual landscape&#x2019;s boundaries have been expanded to include a host of practices that are unthinkable in that classic tome. Although it also covers the basics, The Boudoir Bible fills those niches missing from other sex guides nicely, with full, elaborated chapters on rope bondage, restraints of sound and sight, erotic flagellation, and the stimulation of new erogenous zones, among innumerable other offerings. Well-researched, The Boudoir Bible is written from a joyful, sex-positive point of view. Going beyond the "lovemaking" of older guides, this witty and uninhibited tome expands the sexual act to encompass "verboten" topics, with chapters entitled "The Genital Gym," "Nipple Tease," "Male Ejaculation Control," and "The Anthems of Anal Sex." Illustrated by the renowned artist Fran�ois Berthoud, whose provocative creations have graced both Prada campaigns and museum exhibitions, The Boudoir Bible provides a fresh view of sexuality in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Betony Vernon is a sex educator based in Paris and Milan.

In some ways, Albert Jay Nock has summed it all up in this astonishing book Our Enemy the State, the influence of which has grown every year since its publication. Albert Jay Nock was a prominent essayist at the height of the New Deal. In 1935, hardly any public intellectuals were making much sense at all. They pushed socialism. They pushed fascism. Everyone had a plan. Hardly anyone considered the possibility that the state was not fixing society but destroying it bit by bit. And so Albert Jay Nock came forward to write what needed to be written. And he ended up penning a classic of American political commentary, one that absolutely must be read by every student of economics and government, Our Enemy the State. Consider his opening two paragraphs: If we look beneath the surface of our public affairs, we can discern one fundamental fact, namely: a great redistribution of power between society and the State. This is the fact that interests the student of civilization. He has only a secondary or derived interest in matters like price-fixing, wage-fixing, inflation, political banking, &#34;agricultural adjustment,&#34; and similar items of State policy that fill the pages of newspapers and the mouths of publicists and politicians. All these can be run up under one head. They have an immediate and temporary importance, and for this reason they monopolize public attention, but they all come to the same thing; which is, an increase of State power and a corresponding decrease of social power. It is unfortunately none too well understood that, just as the State has no money of its own, so it has no power of its own. All the power it has is what society gives it, plus what it confiscates from time to time on one pretext or another; there is no other source from which State power can be drawn. Therefore every assumption of State power, whether by gift or seizure, leaves society with so much less power; there is never, nor can there be, any strengthening of State power without a corresponding and roughly equivalent depletion of social power. The theory is good enough and strong enough for the forging of an entire apparatus of libertarian thought, which he does here. But then he pushes the envelope. He discusses American history in a way that you will never read in the civics texts. He praises the Articles of Confederation as the closest model of American freedom. And he blasts the men who hammered out the Constitution as nothing but usurpers engaged in a coup d&#39;etat. Far from heralding the drafters, he exposes them as public creditors, land speculators, money lenders, and industrialists looking for privilege. They tossed out the Articles and used unscrupulous methods to ram the Constitution down the public&#39;s throat. It was in this stage of American history, Nock says, that the state was unleashed. Next came the party system, and the dynamics of statism that causes &#34;every intervention by the State&#34; to enable another so that &#34;the State stands ever ready and eager to make&#34; interventions through deceit and lies. One realizes many important points about Albert Jay Nock when reading this. First, he was brilliant, original, and courageous. Second, he hated politics -- indeed he hated politics so much that he wanted a society that was completely free of it. This is why he is often described as anarchist. Third, he surely was one of the great stylists of the English language in the history of 20th century writing. Those who have read Nock know that there is something about his writing that tugs very deeply on one&#39;s conscience and soul. This book will linger in your mind as you read the daily headlines. He makes his points so well that they become unforgettable. This book is the ultimate handbook of the political dissident. If you aren&#39;t one yet, you may find that Albert Jay Nock is a very persuasive recruiter into his informed army that makes up the remnant who know.</p><p><p>How wonderful to have this book back in print! If any libertarian work is to graced with the word "classic," this is it. Nock was without a doubt one of the most learned and eloquent spokesmen for individual liberty who ever lived. Our Enemy, the State, published in 1935, combines history, politics social theory into a poignant appeal for natural rights, free markets, and peace. The style sores. The power of this work has never been matched.<br> This edition includes an extra treat: Nock's wonderful essay "On Doing the Right Thing," a profound affirmation of man's fitness for freedom and nobility. Also included here are two stunning pieces from Walter E. Grinder of the Institute for Humane Studies: an introduction on Nock's life and the meaning of his work, and a bibliography that anyone interested in liberty should be familiar with.<br> For Nock, the state is not some faceless institution that somehow appears and works its will mysteriously. Drawing on Franz Oppenheimer's The State, Nock notes that "the State invariably had its origins in conquest and confiscation" and is a tool used by one class to exploit another. Here he stands foursquare in the tradition of the earlier French classical-liberal class analysts Comte and Dunoyer, who originated the view that the State is the source of the classes that later came to be called taxpayers and tax-eaters.<br> The barely touches the surface of Nock's analysis, however, which is endlessly rich and powerful. Buy Our Enemy, the State; be inspired by it. You will read it many times. -- Sheldon L. Richman</p><p>Nock's Our Enemy, the State is a great and seminal work, in which Nock, in his justly renowned style, introduces the vital libertarian concepts of "State power" and "Social power," an applies them to American history. "Social power" is people freely creating and voluntarily exchanging and interacting, and is responsible for Western prosperity and civilization. "State power" is the age-old process by which force and theft combine to cripple and confiscate the fruits of Social power. Nowhere can the reader find a clearer or more forceful portrayal of the libertarian position than in this book.--Murray N. Rothbard in Laissez Faire Review -- Murray N.

This book is completely waterproof. Swimmers can take the book pool-side and plan their workout as they swim. Each page of workouts is cut into three segments--the first segment contains a warm up, the second a main set, and the third a cool down. The book can easily be configured into over 6,700 different workouts by combining any warm up with any main set and any cool down. In other words, if the book is used three days a week, it would take over 40 years before the same workout is repeated! The book presents three levels of workouts, from beginner to intermediate. The three segments allow swimmers to mix and match their workouts by combining any of the levels together. Swimmers can vary their routine by simply flipping the segments. (The Waterproof Swimmer, the sequel to the Waterproof Coach, was published in 2018. The Waterproof Swimmer is more appropriate for advanced swimmers.) (Sadly we recently had to raise the price--production costs have risen a good bit. This is the first price increase in 22 years!)</p><p>I thought about the concept for The Waterproof Coach for five years before I wrote the book. I had heard many a bored swimmer complaining about doing the same workout over and over again, many using index cards wrapped in plastic! I decided to create a book with which the swimmer could create thousands of workouts merely by arranging the segmented pages. I also decided to make the book waterproof so that the swimmer could take the pool right on deck. I hope you enjoy the result!Thomas Denes competes in Masters swimming competitions at both the national international levels, placing in events as diverse as the 50 meter freestyle and the 2 mile open water swim.

Marvellous Underground Journey</h2><p><p>Complete and unabridged with all original illustrations.</p><p>The Collected Works of Ingersoll Lockwood: The Baron Trump Novels &amp;&nbsp; 1900; Or, The Last President, have seen a resurgence in interest since Donald Trump&#x2019;s election to President of the United States in 2016. All of these titles were written before the turn of the 20th Century, but both contain eerie similarities with modern day political events. For the first time, all the works are presented in a single volume so readers can decipher for themselves whether Lockwood&#x2019;s words were a telling of things to come, or just a curious coincidence of American literature.</p><p>In the 1890s, Ingersoll Lockwood authored a series of children&#x2019;s books about the escapades of his character, the young Baron Trump: Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and his Wonderful Dog Bulger, and Baron Trump&#x2019;s Marvellous Underground Journey. The series followed a literary trend of the time, which had child protagonists adventuring to enchanted lands and encountering fantastic beings. Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Alice in Wonderland, and L. Frank Baum&#x2019;s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz are two famous examples of this genre.</p><p>Lockwood&#x2019;s Baron is an aristocratic youth bored with his life of luxury in Castle Trump. Searching for adventure, Baron travels to Russia to discover an underground world beneath his feet. He journeys downward and finds himself lost in peculiar settings surrounded by the strange inhabitants of this new world. The stories follow his adventures and eventual struggle to find his way back to the surface he left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Baron Trump novels were obscured by the more successful children&#x2019;s books of the time. Lockwood&#x2019;s tall tales seemed destined for the literary dust bin, but the election of Donald Trump in 2016 renewed interest in these works due to the President&#x2019;s youngest son&#x2019;s name: Barron Trump. Now, back in print, the Baron Trump series is enjoying considerable interest and success.</p><p>In 1900; Or, The Last President, Ingersoll Lockwood paints the picture of a politically charged New York City, where a political outsider has overcome stiff opposition to be elected President of the United States. Mob rule threatens, and marching protests rove up and down Fifth Avenue. The scene is an uncanny reflection of what happened as Donald Trump spent his days as President Elect holed up in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue as he awaited his inauguration.</p></p><p>Ingersoll Lockwood was born at Ossining, New York, in August 1841 to a well-known legal family. His father, Munson Lockwood, was a brigadier general in the New York State Militia, a lawyer, and also went on to hold the position of Warden at the famous Sing Sing prison. Both of Ingersoll&#39;s uncles, Ralph and Albert Lockwood, were also attorneys. Ingersoll was trained in the law, but before establishing a practice, he was appointed Consul to the Kingdom of Hanover by the Lincoln Administration - becoming the youngest member of a U.S. delegation. After his federal service, Ingersoll came back to New York City where he established a successful firm with his brother Henry. In addition to his legal work, Ingersoll began a writing career, which included political essays, fiction and poetry. His most successful works were his children&#39;s novels surrounding the character of Baron Trump. He retired to Saratoga Springs New York where he continued to write, publishing his last book of poetry five years before his death in 1918.</p><h2>Ending Female Pain, A Woman&#39;s Manual, Expanded 2nd Edition: The Ultimate Self-Help Guide for Women Suffering From Chronic Pelvic and Sexual Pain</h2><p>Isa Herrera, MSPT, CSCS, women&#x2019;s health physiotherapist, has written the quintessential self-help book for women suffering from chronic pelvic and sexual pain.

This volume, for leaders and emergent leaders in religious and other settings, sets forth the context and principles for ethical leadership, particularly for ministries and other professions whose mission directly advances the common good. Fluker&#39;s volume grounds leadership in story, the appropriation of one&#39;s roots, as a basis for personal and social transformation. He then explores the key values of character, civility, and community for ethical action on the personal, public, and spiritual realms. From these considerations he develops a model of the specific virtues that embody each realm of ethical leadership before applying them to the practical aspects of leadership and decisionmaking.</p><p>Walter Earl Fluker is Executive Director of the Leadership Center at Morehouse College, Atlanta; the Coca-Cola Professor of Leadership Studies there; and editor of the Howard Thurman Papers Project.</p><h2>Behavioral Consultation and Primary Care: A Guide to Integrating Services</h2><p><p><i>&#x201c;In this 2</i><i>nd</i><i> edition, Robinson and Reiter give us an updated blueprint for full integration of behavioral health and primary care in practice.

Environmental problems are, first and foremost, people problems. Without better understandings of the people involved, solutions are often hard to come by, regardless of expertise in biology, ecology, or other traditional conservation sciences. This novel book provides an accessible survey of a broad range of theories widely applicable to environmental problems that students and practitioners can apply to their work. It serves as a simple reference guide to illuminate the value and utility of social science theories for the practice of environmental conservation.

At its heart is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It is an approach that is ideally suited to making initial assessments based on incomplete or imperfect information; as that information is gathered and disseminated, the Bayesian approach corrects or replaces the assumptions and alters its decision-making accordingly to generate a new set of probabilities. As new data/evidence becomes available the probability for a particular hypothesis can therefore be steadily refined and revised. It is very well-suited to the scientific method in general and is widely used across the social, biological, medical, and physical sciences. Key to this book's novel and informal perspective is its unique pedagogy, a question and answer approach that utilizes accessible language, humor, plentiful illustrations, and frequent reference to on-line resources. <br><br><em>Bayesian Statistics for Beginners</em> is an introductory textbook suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students, professional researchers, and practitioners seeking to improve their understanding of the Bayesian statistical techniques they routinely use for data analysis in the life and medical sciences, psychology, public health, business, and other fields.<br></p><p><br>Therese Donovan, <em>Wildlife Biologist, U.S. Geological Survey, Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, University of Vermont, USA</em>,Ruth M.

It was late spring, just before the arrival of the swarms of rowers, hikers, and campers that descend on the region each summer. I did not know at the time that in eons past this appealing landscape had also attracted groups of the earliest humans. Their ancient campsites, usually found under the rock overhangs in the limestone cliffs that line the rivers, have kept archaeologists happily busy since they were first discovered more than 150 years ago. <br><br>As the archaeologists dig deeper, they find layer upon layer of occupation, the date of each layer receding further into the past. Occasionally, in the upper levels, which can be 15,000 to 20,000 years old, these digs turn up tiny beads patiently crafted from ivory, an engraving of an animal on a rock, or some reindeer&#x2019;s teeth with a hole drilled at the root that were once part of a necklace. The people who made these delicate objects were the same ones who ventured into the caverns in the hillsides, sometimes crawling through narrow passages for hundreds of yards, to create the paintings, engravings, and bas-relief sculptures that still touch the soul of everyone who sees them. <br><br>During our trip Vivian and I stopped at Les Eyzies-de-Tyac, a village on the banks of the V�z�re River. We turned out our horses in a small pasture conveniently across the road from our hotel and went to visit Font-de-Gaume, then as now the only cave with polychrome paintings that is still open to the public. After a surprisingly steep climb, we arrived at the entrance&#x2014;a narrow, upright gash in the rock near the top of a cliff. Three or four other tourists were waiting when Vivian and I arrived. <br><br>In a few moments the guide to the cave arrived and unlocked the metal door that covered the entrance. We walked in single file down a tall, narrow passageway that proceeded roughly in a straight line despite a few slight twists and turns. A narrow metal grille placed in sections along the way protected the cave floor. There were rather dim lights hidden in the walls on both sides. The guide turned them on in a given section as we arrived there and then turned them off as we passed through. After about seventy yards, the guide stopped. Using a red laser as a pointer, she began talking about the first painting. <br><br>I was tremendously excited. The little I knew about prehistoric painted caves came from photographs in books and magazines. Now, some of the real paintings were right in front of me in all their glory. There were round, fat bison drawn in gentle curving lines. They had deep, expressive eyes and tiny legs drawn in perfect perspective. Mammoths with long, curved tusks stood placidly among the bison. Horses outlined in black, now partially obscured by natural excretions, galloped across the cave wall. Most impressive of all were two large reindeer facing each other. The one on the right, a female, was on her knees. The male on the left, whose antlers formed a magnificent long arc, had gently lowered his head toward her and had just begun licking the top of her brow. The grandeur of the male and the delicacy of the female in this quiet moment, so intimate and tender, made the painting touching and irresistible. <br><br>Beauty in art or in nature or in a person is always surprising because it is stronger and more affecting than you could have anticipated. That&#x2019;s why, even though I was prepared for the paintings in Font-de-Gaume to be beautiful, seeing them was startlingly intense, like having a flashbulb ignite two inches from your eyes. I was reeling a little, since there was so much about the paintings I hadn&#x2019;t expected. <br><br>For one thing, they were punctuated with indecipherable signs. The simplest ones consisted of a horizontal line and a vertical one, like an upside-down T. Other signs had lines added to this basic shape. Some had slanted lines at the top and others had parallel vertical lines that made the sign look like a stick-figure house. And there were signs in different styles. Some were grids of straight lines inside a rectangle. Others were simply two circles below two arcs. They resembled a cartoon ghost peering above the horizon. Often the signs appeared alone, but they might also appear near or even within a painting. They weren&#x2019;t writing, since the signs didn&#x2019;t repeat the way writing would. Instead they must have been an elaborate code, with each variation having a specific meaning&#x2014;a number or clan or time of year. In fact, they could be anything. But the presence of the signs proves that the paintings meant more to the people who made them than the paintings alone could convey. The signs marked the paintings in some way. They classified them or ordered them or attributed them according to . . . what? It gave me a start to realize that for their creators, these paintings by themselves were not enough. They needed a gloss, elaboration, <i>captions!</i> <br><br>Also, I was astounded by the way the cave artists used the contours of the cave wall to enhance their work. This is a special quality of cave art that photographs rarely convey. The powerful shoulders of bison, for instance, are often painted over a bulge in the rock that makes the muscles of the animals seem to swell realistically and gives the work a dimension that would have been impossible on a flat surface. This happens so often that it&#x2019;s clear that the artists weren&#x2019;t simply taking advantage of the contours they happened upon as they painted. Instead they must have examined the wall closely first so as to find the places where the shape of the wall suggested animals or parts of animals before they began to paint. This meant that, at least some of the time, the cave artists had painted the animals suggested by the wall rather than imposing their own ideas onto the surface. <br><br>Photographs in books or magazines make the paintings look random, and even in the cave there isn&#x2019;t any apparent order at first. The animals seem lumped together according to whims of the ancient artists, and they are often painted one on top of the other in ways that are impossible in nature. The guide pointed out a red bison facing left that had a mammoth engraved over it facing right. The size of the two animals was roughly the same even though a real mammoth would have been immensely larger than a real bison. And, with the exception of the male reindeer licking the female, the animals didn&#x2019;t seem to be doing anything. They were just there on the rock. Sometimes they faced each other head on, but even then they stood stoically and without any sign of aggression. And the mix of animals&#x2014;bison, mammoths, horses, and even a rhinoceros&#x2014;seemed random as well. <br><br>That is, they seemed random until you looked a second time. We were in the cave only forty-five minutes that afternoon, but that was just long enough to begin to see some order despite the apparent chaos. Female animals are painted red, for example, although not every red animal is a female. When animals face each other, one is red and one is black. The black animal is on the right in the paintings nearer the entrance but appears on the left in the paintings farther in the interior. Late in the tour, I looked back at a frieze of bison that I had seen straight on a few moments earlier. Now the animals curved around the wall of the cave and appeared three-dimensional. Their legs were in perfect perspective, which added to the strong illusion that they were moving away down the corridor. Clearly the artist had planned for the painting to be seen from the spot where I stood. <br><br>That spot, provocatively, was before a tall but shallow cavity in the wall that is known as the Bison Cabinet. It was located in a spacious oval room that opened at the end of the long corridor we had followed from the entrance. The room reminded me of a nave in a small church. It even had a domed roof. And the Bison Cabinet, which was a curving recess, had the air of an adjoining chapel. As the name suggests, it is filled with paintings of bison. Five are well preserved and easy to see, but originally there were ten or more. The bison swirl about as if floating in the clouds. They face right, left, up, or down, and just below them is a wide horizontal fissure in the wall. Were they emerging from the fissure or were they being sucked down into it? And wasn&#x2019;t there some connection between these bison in the Cabinet and the bison receding down the hallway that were best seen from a spot just before the Cabinet? <br><br>Vivian had looked as long and hard as I had, and we both found ourselves put into a kind of emotional swirl by the experience. Happy but set slightly off-kilter by what we had just seen, we left the cave to visit the museum of prehistory. In the summer of 2004 the museum moved to a dramatic new building located just below the old one. But in 1986, the museum was still in an old chateau high in the cliffs behind Les Eyzies. The rooms were filled with polished wood-and-glass cases that seemed left over from the nineteenth century. Some of them held the tedious, repetitive displays of chipped stone tools&#x2014;meaningless to a layman&#x2014;that are inevitable in a museum devoted to ancient humans. But other cases contained rocks or pieces of antler with engravings of bison or horses. There were a few rocks with engravings of vulvas that were so faint it was a wonder that even archaeologists on the lookout for artifacts had noticed them. We wandered about listlessly. In Font-de-Gaume we had just seen the heights Ice Age civilization could reach. In the museum we were seeing the detritus of daily life. <br><br>At last we walked back outside. In front of the museum there was a long, narrow terrace with a white limestone statue of a Neanderthal in one corner. Perhaps seven feet tall, streaked and stained by wind and rain, he stared out of sunken eyes. His square head sunk down in his neck, he held his arms stiffly at his sides, and his face was contorted. Everything about his expression and posture conveyed tension, anger, and threat. He frightened and embarrassed my daughter, who declined to have her picture taken with, as she said, &#x201c;a naked cave man.&#x201d; <br><br>Instead we turned away and looked out across the valley below. The village was just at our feet. In front of it, the V�z�re River made a long slow bend. Trees whose branches bent down to the water lined both riverbanks. Beyond them a wide, level valley stretched out until, in the distance, another wall of cliffs rose up. Gray clouds, threatening rain, covered the sky and made the valley look lush and green, and for just a moment everything I had seen that afternoon made sense. <br><br>If you looked at the landscape the way early humans might have, it became clear why they had made their homes in the cliffs where my daughter and I now stood. The overhangs gave shelter. The height of the cliffs prevented any approach from the rear by threatening animals or by other humans. The river below would attract herds of migrating animals and other game, and anyone living high in the cliffs could follow their movements for miles across the valley. Here was a safe place to live where food was plentiful. <br><br>But surely those practical reasons weren&#x2019;t everything. There was something else about the landscape before us, something that would have been surpassingly important to people who could paint masterpieces on the walls of a cave. The landscape was beautiful. Sometime long ago, hadn&#x2019;t our distant ancestors stood where we now stood and paused, as we did now, to relish the scene below, to revel in the trees by the river flowering in springtime, to watch the flight of birds or the patterns of animal herds crossing the valley, or to marvel as a storm front moved in over the distant hills, as one was doing now? <br><br>In that moment when the three of us&#x2014;the angry statue, my daughter, and I&#x2014;all looked across the same green, ancient, and seductive landscape, this book was born.<br>During my research, every time I entered a cave the same excitement I&#x2019;d felt the day I first saw Font-de-Gaume with Vivian returned undiminished. It happened even when I revisited Font-de-Gaume itself many times, often arranging to go alone with just a guide. The solemn mammoths, the tender reindeer, and the swirling bison in the Bison Cabinet never failed to make me pause in wonder. <br><br>But, as the caves became more familiar, I was also able to assume scientific neutrality. As a result, I began to see much more. I would stand by a wall while the guide shone a light at oblique angles, and figures that had been invisible rose into view as if they had been summoned from the solid rock behind the surface of the wall. Sometimes these images were beautiful, but sometimes they appeared to be just doodling&#x2014;strange animals, funny human shapes, or a line of red painted in a small crevice to make it look like a vulva. Such great variety in a single cave proved that many people had ventured inside for a variety of reasons. Not everyone who drew on the walls was a great master&#x2014;although many were. And not everyone who entered the cave kept his or her mind on solemn thoughts. While some painted grand images of their society&#x2019;s history or myths or visions, others seemed to have scratched their own private musings in the corners. Everything that&#x2019;s there&#x2014;not just certain images or groups of images&#x2014;must be considered in order to understand the meaning of the art in the caves. <br><br>This book contains two narratives, one considerably shorter than the other. The shorter one covers several million years as Homo sapiens arose in Africa, migrated out, and, about 50,000 years ago, pushed across Europe from east to west. Some groups went on clear to the Atlantic Ocean. But those who stopped short of the ocean and lived on either side of the Pyrenees were the ones who began to paint in the caves. Their work was the most impressive part of an outflowing of creativity by <i>Homo sapiens</i> that began about 45,000 years ago and has continued ever since.</p><h2>History of the Liturgy: The Major Stages</h2><p><p>How great the differences between the Last Supper celebrated by Jesus and a pontifical High Mass at St. Peter's in Rome! And also, between the early baptisms by immersion described in the Acts of the Apostles and the baptisms of newborns in our parishes today. Why such a change in the celebration of the Christian mystery? Why the recent reforms, often misunderstood? In History of the Liturgy, Marcel Metzger answers such questions and offers an understanding of this evolution through a carefully documented historical survey.</p> <p>The essential forms of the liturgy were fixed very early according to the tradition received from the apostles. But the place given to biblical readings, teaching, singing, and ritual has varied in the course of the centuries.</p> <p>In History of the Liturgy, Metzger describes the most important phases of these changes. In describing the first millennium, he focuses on liturgy's essentials common to the Eastern and Western Churches. In describing the second millennium, he explains the deviations of the Western Churches which called for the effort of reform and renewal begun by Vatican II.</p> <p>Metzger studies the development of the liturgical institutions and distinguishes liturgy's five main stages that correspond to the situations of the Churches in ancient, medieval, and modern societies. He begins by focusing on the apostolic period, roughly the first century of our era, until the death of the apostles. He follows by studying the period of minorities and semi-clan destiny until the beginning of the fourth century. He then focuses on the Peace of the Church," which grants public status to the churches in the Empire, fosters their growth, and organizes the collaboration between Empire and Church. The work concludes by studying the stability, rigidity, renewals, and reforms of the Roman liturgy, from the end of the Middle Ages to Vatican II.</p> <p>This clear and accurate survey of the history of liturgy is designed to awaken readers' interest, on a solid yet introductory level, in the realities that have made and still make up the Church's liturgical life: assemblies, Eucharist, baptism, reconciliation, dally praise, the Church's calendar, and its architecture.</p> <p>In History of the Liturgy, Metzger stresses that if history is the teacher of life, the eyes of Christian faith allow us to recognize in it as well the mysterious presence of God, who, through the Spirit, guides his people. And this happens, above all, in the liturgy.</p>"</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French. . . goes to the heart of what is Liturgy and why it has developed to the point at which we celebrate it today.The Priest</p><h2>Magician&#39;s End: Book Three of the Chaoswar Saga (Chaoswar Saga, 3)</h2><p><p>Three decades...Five Riftwars...One magnificent saga: Magician's End is the final book in <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Raymond E.

Rather than burdening the reader with difficult or arcane references and arguments, he writes of familiar feelings and situations and allows the theology to unfold naturally. In <i>First Comes Love</i>, Hahn turns his attention to the search for a sense of belonging, revealing the intimate connection between the families men and women create on earth and the divine family, the Holy Trinity. <br><br>Delving into the Gospels, Hahn shows that family terminology--words like <i>brother</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>father</i>, and <i>home</i>--dominates Jesus' speech and the writings of His first followers, and that these very words illuminate Christianity's central ideas. As he explores the fatherhood of God, the marriage of the Church to Christ, and the all-enveloping role of the Holy Spirit, Hahn deepens readers' understanding of the sacraments, teaches them how to create a family life in the image of the Trinity, and demonstrates the ways in which the analogy of the family applies to every aspect of Catholicism and its practices--from the role of "father" embodied by the ancient patriarchs and contemporary parish priests, to the comfort and guidance offered by the brothers and sisters who comprise the Communion of Saints, to the nurturing embrace of Mary, the mother of all Christians. <br><br>Through real-life examples (both humorous and compassionate) and quotations drawn from the Scriptures, Hahn makes it clear that no matter what sort of family readers come from--no matter what sort of "dysfunction" they have experienced--they can find a family in the Church. Reaching out to newcomers and to lifelong Christians alike, <i>First Comes Love </i>is an invitation to discover a true home in the divine.</p><p>Scott Hahn, in <i>First Comes Love</i>, uses the idea of family to explain Catholic thought about the Trinity. Hahn believes that the relations among the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are a model for the relations among every nuclear unit composed of father, mother, and child. And he believes that the family of the Church helps people emulate the Trinitarian family and can heal them when they fall short of such holiness. Hahn moves easily from personal anecdote to Scriptural analysis, making his case that Jesus understood all of humanity as part of one family when he called his followers brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. <i>First Comes Love</i> makes the salutary point that neither romance nor parenthood alone can give us a sufficient sense of belonging. "God built us all to live in a much larger family, to experience a much larger love ... a love that extends infinitely." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Hahn reflects simply yet profoundly on the nitty-gritty of life, love, relationships, marriage, and family in the context of the bedrock doctrines of Christian Faith. His retelling of the story of our salvation in Jesus Christ opens up to the truth of our origin and destiny in the one God, a Trinity of divine Persons who abide in a communion of love--a love stronger than sin and death. This book is full of good news and solid answers to life&#x2019;s tough questions."<br>--Most Reverend Charles J. Chaput, OFM Cap., Archbishop of Denver<br><br>"It is a joy to recommend this most recent accomplishment of Scott Hahn to anyone looking for a faith-filled, Spirit-driven, and completely delightful exposition of the meaning of family in all of its divine and human implications." <br>--Most Reverend Donald W. Wuerl, Bishop of Pittsburgh</p><h2>Dogs on Duty: Soldiers&#39; Best Friends on the Battlefield and Beyond</h2><p><p>When the news of the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound broke, the SEAL team member that stole the show was a highly trained canine companion. Throughout history, dogs have been key contributors to military units. Dorothy Hinshaw Patent follows man's best friend onto the battlefield, showing readers why dogs are uniquely qualified for the job at hand, how they are trained, how they contribute to missions, and what happens when they retire. With full-color photographs throughout and sidebars featuring heroic canines throughout history, <i>Dogs on Duty</i> provides a fascinating look at these exceptional soldiers and companions.</p></p><p><p><b>Dorothy Hinshaw Patent</b> has written more than a hundred books including <i>Saving Audie: A Pit Bull Puppy Gets a Second Chance</i>; <i>When the Wolves Returned: Restoring Nature's Balance in Yellowstone</i>, an ALA Notable Children's Book; and <i>The Right Dog for the Job: Ira's Path from Service Dog to Guide Dog</i>.<br>www.dorothyhinshawpatent.com<br>www.inkthinktank.com</p>Gr 3-6-The invaluable contributions of Military Working Dogs are well documented in this book. Patent discusses their special attributes such as the night vision and sense of smell that help MWDs to keep their human partners safe. The roles they have played in World Wars I and II, in Vietnam, and in Iraq and Afghanistan are highlighted. Brief histories of individual dogs such as Stubby from World War I and Eli in Afghanistan are touchingly told. Present-day training and equipment are also explained. The excellently selected, full-color photos constantly capture these devoted canines selflessly performing their duties and sometimes just offering comfort and affection to their human counterparts. The author points out that the military continues to classify these dogs as equipment in spite of their unique service, and many were abandoned in Vietnam when the U.S. left the country. Today, more are returning home and being adopted or continuing to serve in other capacities. Their story is impressive and the author has told it well.-Carol Schene, formerly at Taunton Public Schools, MA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

"Mr. Piggott and his sons are a male chauvinist lot who, outside of yelling for their dinner, don't exercise themselves much around the house. When Mrs. Piggott finally tires of the endless chores that sandwich her workday, she leaves the menfolk on their own, with a note saying, 'You are pigs.' With the cooking and housework untended, they soon turn genuinely porcine, a transformation Browne foreshadows with pig faces on the wallpaper, vases, fireplace, phone. As in most of Browne's art, there is more than a touch of irony and visual humor here. Fun to read aloud."--<i>Bulletin, Center for Children's Books.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>Anthony Browne is rightly regarded as one of the world's leading picturebook creators.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in England with his wife and two children.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has won awards in many countries, including the Kate Greenaway Medal of England for GORILLA and ZOO,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Kurt Maschler Award of Germany for GORILLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;His inspiration for GORILLA came from a combination of things -- a greeting card he'd designed of a huge macho gorilla holding a teddy bear, a very lonely boy he knew whose father lived in New Zealand, his own fascination with gorillas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The behavior of a real family provided the idea for PIGGYBOOK (not his own, however!)&nbsp;&nbsp;When the book was completed, he presented the family with a copy, without comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn't see any relevance to themselves!&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Gr 1 - 3 A wickedly feminist tale if there ever was one, this is the story of Mrs. Pigott, domestic drudge to her husband and two sons. Tired of her lot, she leaves them for a few days, her only message being a note on the mantel: ``You are pigs.'' As the days pass and the menfolk fail miserably at fending for themselves, a unique transformation occurs: they become pigs in fact as well as in habit. Never fear, though; Mrs. P. returns, chores are divided up democratically, and peace and tranquility are restored. The feminist theme would bludgeon the plot were it not for the exceedingly clever illustrations: even before the porcine evolution of the males, there are hints of piggery everywherein the father's lapel carnation, the boys' upturned noses, a piggy bank, a light switch. After the transformation, pigs turn up everywhere, including on the wallpaper (which was formerly a rose design). Browne also uses a sly before-and-after technique in his portrayal of Mrs. Pigott, who starts out as a drab, shadowy figure, face averted, while the males are brightly drawn in full light and full-face. After the victory for women's rights, however, Mrs. P. is drawn in an equal style. In terms of cleverness and style, this one brings home the bacon. Kathleen Brachmann, Highland Park Pub .

In&nbsp;<em>Edwards on the Christian Life</em>, Dane Ortlund invites us to explore the great eighteenth-century pastor&#x2019;s central passion: God&#x2019;s resplendent beauty. Whether the topic was the nature of love, the preeminence of Scripture, or the glory of the natural world, the concept of beauty stood at the heart of Edwards&#x2019;s theology and permeated his portrait of the Christian life. Clear and engaging, this accessible volume will inspire you to embrace Edwards&#x2019;s magnificent vision of what it means to be a Christian: enjoying and reflecting of the beauty of God in all things.</p><p>Martin Luther&#x2019;s historical significance can hardly be overstated. Known as the father of the Protestant Reformation, no single figure has had a greater impact on Western Christianity except perhaps Augustine. In&nbsp;<em>Luther on the Christian Life</em>, historian Carl Trueman introduces readers to the lively Reformer, taking them on a tour of his historical context, theological system, and approach to the Christian life. Whether exploring Luther&#x2019;s theology of protest, ever-present sense of humor, or misunderstood view of sanctification, this addition to Crossway&#x2019;s Theologians on the Christian Life series highlights the ways in which Luther&#x2019;s eventful life shaped his understanding of what it means to be a Christian. Ultimately, this book will help modern readers go deeper in their spiritual walk by learning from one of the great teachers of the faith.</p><p>John Newton is best known as the slave trader turned hymn writer who penned the most popular English hymn in history: &#x201c;Amazing Grace.&#x201d; However, many Christians are less familiar with the decades he spent in relative obscurity, laboring as a &#x201c;spiritual doctor&#x201d; while pastoring small parishes in England. In the latest addition to Crossway&#x2019;s growing Theologians on the Christian Life series, Tony Reinke introduces modern readers to Newton&#x2019;s pastoral wisdom by leading them through the many sermons, hymns, and&#x2015;most importantly&#x2015;letters that he wrote over the course of his life. Considered by many to be one of the greatest letter writers of all time, Newton has valuable insights to offer modern Christians, especially when it comes to fusing together sound doctrine, lived experience, and godly practice.</p><p>Widely recognized as a pillar of 20th-century evangelicalism, J. I. Packer has had a profound impact on millions of Christians living today. Now in his late eighties, Packer still exerts an enormous influence on pastors and laypeople around the world through his many books, articles, and recorded lectures&#x2015;works that overflow with spiritual wisdom related to the Christian life. In the latest addition to Crossway&#x2019;s growing Theologians on the Christian Life series, well-known pastor Sam Storms examines Packer&#x2019;s legacy when it comes to the Christian and sanctification. Whether exploring Packer&#x2019;s insights into prayer, Bible study, the sovereignty of God, or the Christian&#x2019;s fight against sin, this accessible book offers readers the chance to learn from the best of Packer&#x2019;s thinking on what true godliness really entails.</p><p>The importance of Dutch theologian Herman Bavinck to Reformed theology is difficult to overstate. Bavinck's comprehensive four volume systematic theology,&nbsp;<em>Reformed Dogmatics</em>, is a modern classic that has influenced countless pastors and theologians over the past 100 years. In&nbsp;<em>Bavinck on the Christian Life</em>, scholar John Bolt brings the great Dutch theologian&#x2019;s life and work to bear on following Jesus in the 21st century. By practically applying Bavinck's systematic works to the Christian life and looking at the life of the man himself, this book shows the direct connection between robust theology, practical holiness, and personal joy.</p><p>John Owen is widely hailed as one of the greatest theologians of all time. His many works&#x2015;especially those encouraging Christians in their struggle against sin&#x2015;continue to speak powerfully to readers today, offering much-needed spiritual guidance for following Christ and resisting temptation day in and day out. Starting with an overview of Owen&#x2019;s life, ministry, and historical context, Michael Haykin and Matthew Barrett introduce&nbsp;readers to the pillars of Owen&#x2019;s spiritual life. From exploring his understanding of believers&#x2019; fellowship with the triune God to highlighting his&nbsp;teaching on justification, this study invites us to learn about the Christian life from the greatest of the English Puritans.</p><p>Part of the&nbsp;Theologians on the Christian Life&nbsp;series.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dane C.

In the last two centuries, however, this area of theological inquiry seems to have dropped off the radar for Christian theologians and practitioners, which may explain why students of Edwards&#x2019;s corpus of writings have not tackled the subject. Ortlund&#x2019;s study nicely fills this lacuna, for he rightly shows, from a multitude of angles, that beauty is the fulcrum of Edwards&#x2019;s thinking.

Serious students, like Dane Ortlund, have long known he was much more. In this book Ortlund puts his careful research to good purpose as he demonstrates convincingly that the center of Edwards&#x2019;s concern was always and supremely beauty&#x2015;in God, from God, and for God. Grateful readers will find this book highly informative on Edwards and deeply encouraging for the Christian life today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark A. Noll,</strong> Francis A.

And how beautiful it is that it depicts the Christian life as ordered by and to the beauty of God.

I couldn&#x2019;t agree more. And one would be hard-pressed to find a more engaging introduction to this universe for the church. Even the final chapter, on ways in which we should not follow Edwards, offers crucial Christian wisdom.

How do we know there is a God?<br>The most obvious question anyone asks a believer is "How do you know God exists?" It's a simple question that has both a simple and a complicated answer. First, the easy part: faith is believing in something or someone you cannot see or believing in what cannot be proven. In other words, faith depends on not having any evidence; otherwise, it would not be faith. So those who believe in God or in a supreme being are taking the word of others or just trusting their own instincts that such an almighty divinity does exist. Many people, whether they are Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, whether Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant, believe in God because they believe in the revealed Word of God, called Sacred Scripture or the Bible.<br>A more complicated answer is that Catholic Christianity does believe you can prove the existence of God. Reason can conclude that a supreme being exists and is necessary, but only faith (believing what cannot or is not known) tells us that there is but one God (monotheism). Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe in only one God, and Christianity is the only of the three to believe that there are three Divine Persons in that one God. Human reason could never figure out the mystery of how there can be three persons but not three gods. Faith is needed to believe that doctrine, and some people never embrace that faith.<br><br>The fact that God exists can be known by reason alone, or it can be believed by faith. The ancient Greeks and Romans used philosophy (logic and reason) centuries before Christ to prove the existence of God or a supreme being. Saint Thomas Aquinas was a Catholic philosopher and theologian in the thirteenth century AD who used that same ancient reasoning to demonstrate the reasonableness of anyone "knowing" that God exists, regardless of whether or not they have faith. He showed that the existence of God can be proved by reason, but after that, one needed supernatural faith to believe the supernatural revelation about the nature of God (for example, the Trinity).</p><h2>Cuentos para pensar (EDICI�N ESPECIAL DE LUJO) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>During his long and plentiful professional career, Jorge Bucay has always recounted stories not only as a means to teach his patients, but also to reflect with them on common worries and concerns of human beings.

How the taste of a Fuji apple differs from a Spartan? For most of us, this is a difficult task: flavor remains a vague, undeveloped concept that we don&#x2019;t know enough about to describe&#x2015;or appreciate&#x2015;fully. In this delightful and compelling exploration of our most neglected sense, veteran science reporter Bob Holmes shows us just how much we&#x2019;re missing.</p><p>Considering every angle of flavor from our neurobiology to the science and practice of modern food production, Holmes takes readers on a journey to uncover the broad range of factors that can affect our appreciation of a fine meal or an exceptional glass of wine. He peers over the shoulders of some of the most fascinating food professionals working today, from cutting-edge chefs to food engineers to mathematicians investigating the perfect combination of pizza toppings. He talks with flavor and olfactory scientists, who describe why two people can experience remarkably different sensations from the same morsel of food, and how something as seemingly unrelated as cultural heritage can actually impact our sense of smell.</p><p>Along the way, even more surprising facts are revealed: that cake tastes sweetest on white plates; that wine experts&#x2019; eyes can fool their noses; and even that language can affect our sense of taste. <em>Flavor</em> expands our curiosity and understanding of one of our most intimate sensations, while ultimately revealing how we can all sharpen our senses and our enjoyment of the things we taste.</p><p>Certain to fascinate everyone from gourmands and scientists to home cooks and their guests, <em>Flavor</em> will open your mind&#x2015;and palate&#x2015;to a vast, exciting sensory world.</p></p><p>Bob Holmes has been a New Scientist magazine correspondent for more than two decades.

The units' existence and missions were protected by cover stories, their operations were secret.&nbsp;<br>The massive armies of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies posed a huge threat to the nations of Western Europe. US military planners decided they needed a plan to slow the juggernaut they expected when and if a war began. The plan was Special Forces Berlin. The first 40 men who came to Berlin in mid-1956 were soon reinforced by 60 more and these 100 soldiers (and their successors) would stand ready to go to war at only two hours' notice, in a hostile area occupied by nearly one million Warsaw Pact forces, until 1990.<br><br>Their mission should hostilities commence was to wreak havoc behind enemy lines, and buy time for vastly outnumbered NATO forces to conduct a breakout from the city. In reality it was an ambitious and extremely dangerous mission, even suicidal. Highly trained and fluent in German, each man was allocated a specific area. They were skilled in clandestine operations, sabotage, intelligence tradecraft and able to act as independent operators, blending into the local population and working unseen in a city awash with spies looking for information on their every move.<br><br>Special Forces Berlin was a one of a kind unit that had no parallel. It left a legacy of a new type of soldier expert in unconventional warfare, one that was sought after for missions such as the attempted rescue of American hostages from Tehran in 1979. With the U.S. government officially acknowledging their existence in 2014, their incredible story can now be told.</p><p>Their enemy: the Armies of the Warsaw Pact - over 1 million strong.<br>Their mission: Buy NATO time in the event of a Soviet attack against Europe.<br>The odds against them: Suicidal.<br><br>These days we often hear of the exploits of special military units like "Delta" and the SEALs. But what about the unit that led the way in the field of unconventional warfare and counterterrorism?<br><br>"No force of its size has contributed more to peace, stability and freedom."<br><br>That's what the former head of US Army Special Operations Command, Lieutenant General Charles Cleveland said about the unique subject of this book.<br><br>This is the history of a unique US Army Special Forces Detachment and the men who served in it. Known initially as Detachment "A" Berlin, it was stationed far behind the Iron Curtain in West Berlin, inside the Soviet-controlled German Democratic Republic. This unit existed for one reason: to cause havoc behind the enemy's lines.<br><br>Like all American Special Forces units, Detachment "A" traced its origins to the Office of Strategic Services, but its methods of operation were unlike those of any other "SF" unit. The book describes the unit's origins and the reasons for its existence through recently declassified files and first person histories of those who served there. These voices will show the unit's evolution as the enemy and the environment changed.&nbsp;The men relate the details of their improbable mission, how they prepared, and how it was to be accomplished. It is told from the soldiers' viewpoint along with the strategic overview from the top.&nbsp;<br><br>Special Forces Berlin's wartime mission was classified Top Secret and was largely unchanged throughout its existence, but it had a second important peacetime mission. In the late 1960s, unrest struck the capitals of Europe as left-wing radicals and Palestinian nationalists began to use terrorism to achieve their political goals. In response, the US European Command ordered the unit to prepare for a new mission: Counterterrorism. The level of expertise it achieved, along with its skills in urban unconventional warfare, led to its participation in the attempted rescue of the American hostages in Teheran, Iran.<br><br>Although the ill-fated Iran Hostage Rescue Raid has been generally covered elsewhere, this book tells an aspect of the story that has never been covered - the Detachment's mission and its men on the ground who led the way for the main force. The history ends with the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the unit left a legacy that served as a guide for the creation of a new kind of Special Mission Unit.&nbsp;<br><br>How can I tell the story? I was there. I served in the unit twice and know the men, mission, and environment well. But this is not my story or my history - it is the history of everyone who served in the unit before, with, and after me. It is told with their stories alongside the history from the unit's files and with images to illustrate the activities from the early days until the end.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a history that may only be told once. Few records remain and many of the men who served in the units are gone. No official history was written and the words contained in this work may well be the definitive history of this very unique US Army unit.The previously untold history of a highly classified US Army Special Forces Detachment&nbsp;covertly stationed in West Berlin, Germany during the Cold War, poised to act if war ever&nbsp;broke out.<br><br>"With this excellent telling, James Stejskal has made an important contribution on several&nbsp;levels to our acknowledged history of US Army Special Forces and the development of&nbsp;today's American special operations capability. The book recognizes a unit, the members of&nbsp;which were among the most impactful of giants on whose shoulders the current special&nbsp;operators stand, whether in the SF groups or in the most clandestine of our special&nbsp;operations "SMU" outfits. ... Their exploits, known to few by design, but long rumored&nbsp;can now be shared with the public and SOF professionals. It is fi tting too that the unit be&nbsp;recognized and her members honored before time finishes with these great men."<br><br>- LTG Charles T. Cleveland, US Army Retired<br><br>"Jim has done an exceptional job capturing and portraying the operational challenges and&nbsp;spirit of commitment by unit members to the mission. Det A was my third Special Forces&nbsp;duty assignment and 4th ODA experience. ... Special Forces existed to make the seemingly&nbsp;impossible feasible and it was a technically sparse time where only the men made success&nbsp;possible. ... The teams going over the wall, I did not envy. However, the psychological&nbsp;pressures of potentially operating in an urban unconventional warfare environment under&nbsp;Soviet occupation were far different that operating in mountains or jungle and many fine&nbsp;folks preferred the open cross wall mission or chose to move on to 1/10 SFGA in Bad&nbsp;Tolz and we recruited from them in return. A great time, outstanding folks, and cherished&nbsp;memories. Special mention for SGM Jeff Raker who was a mentor to all and the glue that&nbsp;bound us together.

This special reissue of a classic work of spirituality from the author of A Wrinkle in Time offers life-transforming insights on the rich heritage of the Bible and shows how the characters of this ancient text are relevant for living the good life now. Includes a new reader's guide.<br><br>In the first book of her Genesis Trilogy, beloved author Madeleine L'Engle casts long, loving, and perceptive glances not only at the created universe but also at its Creator. L'Engle often crafted stories that dealt with the complexities of the universe, navigating time and space, religion and science, with uncanny ease and insight. This skill--most famously demonstrated in A Wrinkle in Time--is showcased in this nonfiction work, And It Was Good, through her ability to see the connection between Made and Maker at every level. She examines the vast beauty, order, and complexity of our world with enthusiasm and reverence, illuminating the characteristics of God, the first poet.<br><br>Madeleine L'Engle possesses the same ambidextrous skill of storytelling as other literary giants, including C.S. Lewis and George MacDonald. Her fictional stories appeal to generations of readers, and are equally embraced in both the secular and religious markets. But it is her ability in her nonfiction to engage with the historical text of the Bible through a dynamic unpacking of protagonists, antagonists, and matters of faith that establishes The Genesis Trilogy as a highly treasured collection of spiritual writings. And It Was Good beautifully approaches both the biblical text and creation itself with an intelligence and sensitivity that appeals to all seekers looking for a fresh communion with God in the natural world.</p><p><b>Madeleine L'Engle</b> was the author of more than forty-five books for all ages, among them the beloved <i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> awarded the Newbery Medal; <i>A Ring of Endless Light,</i> a Newbery Honor Book; <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> winner of the American Book Award; and the Austin family series of which <i>Troubling a Star</i> is the fifth book. L'Engle was named the 1998 recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards award, honoring her lifetime contribution in writing for teens.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle was born in 1918 in New York City. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. After a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York.<br><br>After splitting her time between New York City and Connecticut and acting as the librarian and writer-in-residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle died on September 7, 2007 at the age of 88.</p><h2>Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas</h2><p>Over the centuries, Northern mythology has exerted much influence on Western customs, language, and literature. Its principal theme of the perpetual struggle of the beneficent forces of nature against the injurious, and its twin characteristics of dark tragedy and grim humor, tinge much European literature and music, most notably Wagner&#x2019;s Ring Cycle.<br>In this volume, a noted scholar of myth and folklore has assembled a rich collection of Northern mythology as preserved in the Eddas and sagas of Iceland. These are perhaps the purest versions of the original myths, thanks to the island&#x2019;s remoteness and lack of contact with outside influences. Both grand and tragical, the age-old tales tell of the creation of the world; the heroic deeds of such gods and heroes as Odin, Thor, and Siegfried; the machinations of the evil Loki; the fantastical adventures of giants, dwarfs, and elves; the twilight of the gods; and much else. Sixty-four marvelous, atmospheric illustrations add an additional dimension of charm.<br>In this convenient, reliable edition, <i>Myths of the Norsemen</i> offers not only hours of reading entertainment but also valuable insights into the nature and meaning of myth and how it constitutes part of the deep and ancient wellspring of Western culture.</p><p>H�l�ne Adeline Guerber (1859 &#x2013; 1929), better known as H.A.

But when one of the guests turns up dead, owner Cecily Sinclair Baxter realizes it is not only the Pennyfoot that is back in business&#x2014;the hotel's Christmas curse is, too...</b></b><br><br>The Pennyfoot halls are decked with boughs of holly, a magnificently decorated tree graces the lobby, and the hotel's bookings are finally looking up. Owner of the Pennyfoot, Cecily Sinclair Baxter is in high holiday spirits until disaster strikes, threatening to ruin yet another Yuletide. Her chief housemaid Gertie McBride has found a man's body in the hotel laundry room&#x2014;with a woman's scarf wrapped around his neck and a note in his pocket from the hotel's new maid. <br><br>Cecily is determined to track down the culprit, but with multiple suspects icing her out of crucial clues, she realizes this killer may be more slippery than most. With Christmas right around the corner, it is up to Cecily to prevent this holiday season at the Pennyfoot from turning out more fatal than festive.</p><p><b>Kate Kingsbury</b> is a pseudonym for Doreen Roberts Hight, a full-time writer who lives near Portland, Oregon. She is also the author of the Manor House Mysteries and the Bellehaven House Mysteries (written as Rebecca Kent), the Raven's Nest Bookstore Mysteries (written as Allison Kingsley), and many romance novels written under her own name.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pausing to catch her breath at the top of the backstairs, Gertie McBride shifted the pile of linens she carried higher in her arms. From the kitchen below, she could hear the clatter of pots and pans, and Michel's strident voice bitterly complaining in his stupid French accent that didn't fool anyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The volatile chef always got frantic at Christmastime, and today was no exception. Mrs. Chubb could be heard screeching at him to shut up. Shaking her head, Gertie thanked the heavens that, for a change, she wasn't the one on the business end of the housekeeper's wrath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Breakfast had been served over an hour ago, but already the midday meal was being prepared. Gertie could detect a faint whiff of onions, but the smell was overwhelmed by the fragrant aroma of pine and cedar that wafted across the hotel lobby.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In just a few days it would be Christmas Eve. She cast a glance at the grand curving staircase leading to the upper floors, where huge boughs of evergreens hung on the railings. Bright red ribbons decorated the wreaths as well as little silver bells that tinkled when Gertie's skirts brushed against them on the way down from the guest rooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the far corner the magnificent Christmas tree glowed a welcome to the arriving visitors. Gold and silver stars covered the branches, while little white angels with silvery gowns and red and green balls sparkled in the light from the massive chandelier above. A couple of guests passed by the tree, pausing to admire the decorations before strolling on toward the staircase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heaving a sigh, Gertie stomped down the stairs. The sooner she got the linens down to the laundry room the better. Mrs. Baxter, or madam as everyone called her, would get testy if she saw her chief housemaid carrying dirty washing across the foyer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Pennyfoot's owner was always kind and considerate to the downstairs staff, as long as they obeyed the rules and minded their manners. She could be an ogre, however, if one of them did something to upset the hotel guests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Normally the sheets and pillowcases would be sent down the chute to the downstairs hallway, but the upstairs door was stuck again and Archie would have to mend it. Thinking about the new handyman reminded Gertie of Clive, who used to have the job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She tried not to think about Clive these days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had always loved this time of year. Besides the housekeeping, Mrs. Chubb also baked, and nothing spelled "Christmas" like the enticing smell of her mince pies and plum puddings. Unless it was the sound of Phoebe Fortescue's dance group practicing their horrible out-of-tune singing in the ballroom, or the decorations brightening the halls of the Pennyfoot, or the excitement in her own twins' faces as they eagerly awaited the visit from Father Christmas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This year, however, was different. It didn't seem possible that it had been a whole year since Clive had proposed. She'd been so excited and happy. She's accepted on the spot, and by rights she should be celebrating the season with a new husband and father to her twins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was only three months later when everything fell apart. Clive-the gentle, considerate man she'd fallen in love with-had turned into a domineering, selfish bugger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When she'd told him that after she was married she still wanted to work at the Pennyfoot, he'd thrown a bleeding fit. He'd told her no wife of his would be anyone's maid, and that her place was in the home, taking care of him and her children. He'd made it sound as if her work was too blinking beneath him to be worth anything. As if she wasn't worth anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, that did it. Just because he'd left his job as the Pennyfoot's handyman and bought that flipping toy shop didn't make him bleeding royalty. He was no better than she was, and she'd wasted no time in telling him that. They'd had a good old blowup and she'd told that snot to shove off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reaching the floor, she closed her eyes for a moment to picture the scene, as she had done so many times since the spring. She'd missed him at first, but she'd kept reminding herself that she'd had a lucky escape. He would have dominated her whole life, and no one dominated Gertie Brown McBride. Still, the memories kept coming back to taunt her, making her wonder what might have been if she'd done what he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the next instant she heard a grunt of pain as she smacked into something soft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Opening her eyes, she stared into the gaunt face of Lilly Green, one of the latest maids to have been hired at the Pennyfoot. Lilly was almost as tall as Gertie, who towered over the rest of the staff with the exception of Michel. While Lilly was as skinny as a rake, however, Gertie was fighting a tendency to balloon out of her clothes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was built like a bloody bull to begin with, but had always managed to keep everything in proportion until this last year. No matter how little she ate now, it all seemed to end up on her blinking hips. She'd soon be as plump as Altheda Chubb. The bossy housekeeper was always complaining that her corset was pinching her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You smacked me in the stomach with those," Lilly said, frowning at the linens in Gertie's arms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sorry, luv. I wasn't looking where I was flipping going, was I." Gertie paused for a moment, silently chiding herself. She'd promised herself so many times that she'd try to stop the curse words that seemed to explode from her lips with no way to stop them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd grown up hearing that language from her dad all day long, and sometimes all night, too, and it had become so much part of her speech, she didn't even know she was doing it until someone said something. Usually Mrs. Chubb, who was always on at her to talk like a lady. Some bleeding hope of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why weren't you?" Lilly seemed about to cry. Then again, Lilly looked like that much of the time. She'd been working at the Pennyfoot for over a year, and she still acted like she'd wandered into a house of mirrors and couldn't escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was an air of desperation about her that Gertie simply couldn't understand. It had taken Lilly months to get used to the work, and at times she still turned her nose up at some of the tasks, as if the whole thing was beneath her. She was finicky about everything, and went out of her way to avoid contact with the guests. Especially the men.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gertie tried to get along with her, but was irritated by such a lack of gumption. As for herself, she would tackle anyone or anything that got in her bloody way. Besides, it irked her that Lilly always had her cap on straight and the straps of her apron sitting firmly on her shoulders. Gertie, on the other hand, rarely accomplished either. "Why wasn't I what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Looking where you were going."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh!" Gertie frowned. "I was thinking about something, that's why. Where are you off to anyway? Aren't you supposed to be cleaning the silver?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lilly raised her hand to tuck her hair more securely beneath her cap. "Mrs. Chubb sent me to tell madam that she's baking the Christmas puddings. She wants to know how many madam wants her to make."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Then you'd better get on with it, hadn't you." Gertie stepped past her, adding over her shoulder, "You don't want Chubby after you for loitering. She'll have your bloody guts for garters." Bugger it, she thought. She was swearing again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She could hear Lilly's black patent leather shoes clicking on the stairs as she hurried up them. Shaking her head, Gertie headed for the laundry room. If she didn't get back to the kitchen right away, it would be her guts turning into bloody garters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs. Chubb was like a mother to her, and to the rest of the maids. Her sharp tongue, however, would give them all a lashing if they got behind in their work. Gertie grinned as she shoved the door open with her shoulder. Chubby didn't take no nonsense from anyone. Not even madam, or Mr. Baxter. Gertie liked that. You knew where you was with her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stepping inside the empty room, she marched over to one of the sinks and dumped the linens into it. Three of the ironing boards were stacked against the wall, while a fourth stood a few feet from the window. One of the maids had forgotten to put it away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gertie was tempted to leave it there and get back to the kitchen. She had actually turned toward the door when habit, engrained by years of following the strict rules of the Pennyfoot Hotel, forced her to turn back and fold up the ironing board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As she carried it over to its place against the wall, something caught her attention in the dark corner by the sinks. A bundle of dirty clothes. Someone must have been in a hurry, chucked them at the sink, and missed. She probably hadn't even noticed that they'd landed on the floor. Most likely it was the same bloody twit who'd left the ironing board in the middle of the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cursing under her breath, Gertie stomped across the room to pick up the bundle. As she drew closer, however, cold shock slammed into her chest. It wasn't a bundle of clothes after all. It was a man, lying curled up on his side, his eyes open and staring blankly into space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Here!" Gertie demanded, backing up a step or two. "What the bloody hell are you doing in here? You'd better get out of here before I call the copper and have you thrown in the bloody clink."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man didn't even twitch, and looking at the bloodless face, Gertie thought she knew why. This man wasn't getting up again. He was bleeding dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Upstairs in the lavish suite overlooking the bowling greens, Cecily Sinclair Baxter watched her husband settle into his comfortable armchair with the latest edition of the Illustrated London News.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had been almost a year since a bout of pneumonia had come close to taking Baxter's life. Every time she looked at him, she felt again the anxiety and dread that had filled her very soul when Dr. Kevin Prestwick had turned to her in that dim, candlelit room, his face grave with concern. She had lost her first husband in that same room. She could not bear to lose another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baxter had survived, thank the good Lord, but the illness had left him weak and depressed for months. So much so that he had officially declined the position offered to him as a director of overseas acquisitions-work that would have taken them to all four corners of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baxter had declared one evening over dinner that he had come to the conclusion he was too old to be taking on such a monumental task. "I am much more suited to managing one hotel in one place, rather than chasing all over the world taking on one headache after another," he'd told her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd pretended to be dismayed, but had fallen to her knees later that night and given thanks for this reprieve. The only reason she'd agreed to the opportunity in the first place was because Baxter had come close to being seriously hurt while aiding her in a murder investigation. She had decided they would both be on safer ground away from the Pennyfoot and her penchant for tangling with villains. The possibility of seeing her sons again, both of whom lived abroad, was also an incentive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, she'd hated the very thought of leaving her home and the staff who had become as close as family to her. She had become even more overjoyed when Baxter had surprised her later with a suggestion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I think we should purchase the Pennyfoot from your cousin," he'd said, and for a long moment Cecily had stared at him, afraid to believe what she was hearing in case she was mistaken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When she didn't answer him, Baxter had added, "We could turn it from a country club back into a hotel. The memberships have been dwindling in the last year or so, and with a hotel we would attract a more diverse and hopefully a more abundant clientele."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had leapt at the idea with so much enthusiasm, Baxter had told her he wished he'd thought of the idea sooner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So now that they were once again the owners of the Pennyfoot Hotel, Baxter seemed happy and content and, more important, healthy again. He had maintained his business in London, though he had cut back a good deal of it and now did most of the work at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Christmas was less than a week away, and the aroma of seasonings and spice from the kitchen, blending with the fragrance of fresh greenery from the woods, filled the halls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was her favorite time of the year, and Cecily was so overjoyed, she felt a strong urge to hug her husband. She had actually stretched out her arms to do just that when a sharp rap on the door halted her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baxter sighed and rattled his newspaper as she turned toward the door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come in!" Cecily seated herself on her gold Queen Anne armchair as the door opened and Gertie edged into the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry, m'm," she said, dropping a slight curtsey. "I got some bad news."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baxter groaned, and lowered his newspaper. "What now?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gertie's gaze seemed to fix on Cecily's face. "I was in the laundry room and I thought it were a bundle of clothes lying on the floor, but it weren't." She appeared to have something to add, but apparently had trouble getting it out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cecily was already getting a nasty feeling in her stomach. Every year at this time they seemed to have some kind of disaster. She called it the Christmas Curse, and for years the name had been whispered among the downstairs staff with the same dread that she felt right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She tried to sound calm as she gave Gertie an encouraging smile. "So, what is it, Gertie?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baxter, who had none of his wife's patience and restraint, growled, "Come on, girl. Spit it out."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gertie swallowed, heaved air into her lungs, and announced in a voice hoarse with anxiety, "It were a dead body, m'm. Mr. Baxter. Mrs. Chubb has already sent for the police constable."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, Lord," Baxter muttered, folding his newspaper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cecily could feel her heart pumping. Not again. Not now. Just when they were beginning to see a large increase in bookings. They were already taking reservations for next year. They didn't need another calamity to frighten off prospective guests, or the ones still due to arrive for the holidays, for that matter. "Who is it, Gertie? Is it one of the staff? A footman? Could you tell how he'd died?"</p></p><h2>A Guide to Transfer Factors and Immune System Health: 2nd edition, Helping the body heal itself by strengthening cell-mediated immunity</h2><p>In the second edition of this popular book, Dr. White takes readers on a tour of transfer factors, small peptides found in colostrum and white blood cells that are capable of transferring cell-mediated immunity to pathogens. In language that is easy to follow, the author explores nearly 60 years of research on transfer factors, beginning with their discovery by famed immunologist, H Sherwood Lawrence, in 1949. Evidence suggests that transfer factors, which are generated by the immune system in response to infections and passed from mothers to newborns in pre-milk, carry information that can help the body fight viruses (herpes, hepatitis C, HPV, HIV), bacteria, mycobacteria (tuberculosis), cancers, and perhaps certain autoimmune diseases. Like vaccines, transfer factors could help immunize the public against pathogens before they spread. Dr. White makes a compelling case that larger scientific studies of transfer factors are needed given their potential importance to public health. This book is an enjoyable read about a fascinating topic. Whether you are a patient, doctor, health enthusiast or just a fan of good science writing, this is one to keep on your book shelf. Bound to become a classic.</p><p>Aaron White is a neuroscientist with an interest in how the brain and immune system interact and how to improve the health of both. He has a PhD in biological psychology from Miami University (in Ohio) and currently is an Assistant Professor in Psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center. He stumbled across the topic of transfer factors while reading about emerging treatments for immune disorders and diseases. Amazed by the wealth of research behind this little known but already proven means of treating and immunizing people against diseases he wrote this book about them. The book contains a summary of what we know about transfer factors and the roles they could play in 21st century medicine and public health. And the news is even better the second time around!In this second edition of his book, White continues to raise awareness of the important role transfer factors play in responding to potential threats to the health of the human body. Transfer factors, found in white blood cells, carry information that helps coordinate the immune system&#39;s response to these threats. Transfer factors from one person (or animal) can be introduced into the immune system of another person, potentially transferring an improved ability to combat threats to the recipient&#39;s health. The author presents sufficient evidence that transfer factors are effective weapons against disease and should be more widely used. White encourages physicians to consult the abstracts of published studies he has included in this book. With so many medical mysteries still unsolved, it doesn&#39;t make sense to ignore treatment possibilities. A convincing plea to consider an untapped resource in the fight against disease. --Kirkus Discoveries</p><h2>Ecclesiastes: Annotated &amp; Explained (SkyLight Illuminations)</h2><p><p><strong>Koheleth's powerful guidebook for living without certainty and security in a world of constant change can become a companion for your own spiritual journey.</strong></p><p>Twenty-three hundred years ago, an unnamed Hebrew sage known only as Koheleth, the Assembler of Wisdom, rocked the ancient Jewish world with a critique of society that shattered conventional notions of God, piety, politics and power. Koheleth lived in a world of change and challenge not unlike our own. His teachings, known as the Book of Ecclesiastes, sought to empower people not unlike ourselves, which is why this book of the Hebrew Bible still speaks to us&#x2015;people of all faiths&#x2015;today.</p><p>In this contemporary and accurate translation, Rami Shapiro presents the Book of Ecclesiastes as neither revelation nor prophecy but as a rational and inspirational guide to living well in the midst of uncertainty. Beginning with its opening broadside, <em>"Havel havalim!"</em>&#x2015;not "futility" or "vanity" as most translations would have it, but &#x201c;breath,&#x201d; &#x201c;vapor&#x201d; and &#x201c;impermanence&#x201d;&#x2015;Shapiro opens up Koheleth's approach to living in a world where nothing lasts and justice is illusory; a world devoted to accumulating power, wealth, pleasure and even knowledge that leaves you drowning in anxiety and needless suffering. He shows how Koheleth's God demands neither sacrifice nor adherence to commandments, offering instead a practical lifestyle rooted in moderation, meaningful work and friendship.</p><p>Now you can experience the Book of Ecclesiastes and understand Koheleth&#x2019;s teachings with no previous knowledge of the Hebrew Bible. This SkyLight Illuminations edition presents insightful commentary that restores this ancient text to its timeless place as a guide to living sanely in an often insane world.</p></p><p><p><strong>Rami Shapiro,</strong> a renowned teacher of spirituality across faith traditions, is an award-winning storyteller, poet and essayist.

She heads The Geranium Farm, an online institute for the encouragement of spiritual growth.</p><p>Rabbi Rami Shapiro is a gifted translator and teacher and provides a text that is clear and easy to understand. In his extensive preface he clearly outlines his own presuppositions and his approach to the text of Ecclesiastes. Heavily influenced by Buddhism, he understands the references to "God" in the text as referring to nature or the way things are "under the sun." He tempers his views by noting his understanding that the author is writing for people of all faiths and backgrounds. The book also includes a foreword by Rev. Barbara Cawthorne Crafton.</p><p>Shapiro's notes compare the text of Ecclesiastes with <em>Pirke Avot</em>, as well as with the classic wisdom literature of other religions, and of classical philosophy. According to Rabbi Shapiro, Ecclesiastes is the one book of the Hebrew Bible that speaks to those who may be alienated from traditional religion. The text never uses the Tetragrammaton, and does not discuss devotional practices or life after death. It hews to a simple but thought provoking message that says that the key to a happy and well lived life is to eat and drink simply and moderately, to find good and satisfying work and to cultivate a few close relationships. Rabbi Shapiro emphasizes this point over and over again in his comments.</p><p>Not all will agree with all of his interpretations and conclusions. Nonetheless Rabbi Shapiro's book is a serious, well thought out, and well written contribution to a perplexing part of the Hebrew Bible. His work deserves to be included in all collections devoted to Biblical Studies and Jewish thought, and is appropriate for all adult students of the Bible whether in academia or in the general community.</p> (<i>Association of Jewish Libraries</i>)</p><h2>Fatal Secrets: A Novel of Suspense (FBI Trilogy)</h2><p>DEADLY QUEST <br><br>When a top lieutenant in a notorious ring of human traffickers agrees to turn state&#x2019;s evidence, Immigration and Customs Enforcement senior agent Sonia Knight believes she&#x2019;ll finally take down the illegal operation&#x2019;s devilish mastermind, Xavier Jones.

If Jones gets even a whiff that Vega is turning state&#x2019;s evidence, he and his pregnant wife are dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know it. He hasn&#x2019;t checked in for three days, which isn&#x2019;t like him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kendra Vega is fine. We checked on her yesterday afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For now. But Vega could be getting spooked. It&#x2019;s one thing to talk about getting out of the business, but doing it is another story. These people are ruthless. Vega knows it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you pulled every string and called in every favor to get them into witness protection when he delivers the goods. You can&#x2019;t do squat for him unless he comes back with the promised intel.&#x201d;<br><br>True, but Sonia feared that Xavier Jones was untouchable. He&#x2019;d been getting away with trafficking in humans for years because his instincts were sharp and he trusted no one. That one of his top security men came to her three weeks ago to make a deal was a miracle. She wasn&#x2019;t going to blow it&#x2014;she wanted Jones in prison and the Vegas safe. That&#x2019;s why not hearing from Greg Vega for the last three days disturbed her. Where was he? Why hadn&#x2019;t he checked in?<br><br>&#x201c;I wish we had better information,&#x201d; Trace said, not for the first time.<br><br>They were hiding among the pine trees near Devils Lake, appropriately named considering the son of the devil, Xavier Jones, owned hundreds of acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills abutting the lake. She could see his house with field binoculars, and tonight, like the last two nights, it was dark.<br><br>&#x201c;It will happen this week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is our third night watching Jones&#x2019;s place. He&#x2019;s out of the state, like Vega reported last time he checked in. The kid could be wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d contacted the Transportation Security Administration. Xavier Jones hadn&#x2019;t used his passport. He usually traveled by private plane, both retaining a pilot and having a license himself. Tracking small craft was much more difficult, making the last few days even more frustrating. He could be back in northern California now for all they knew.<br><br>Sonia had spent long days talking with ten-year-old Andres Zamora just to get him to trust her. He told her everything he remembered about his family&#x2019;s abduction and his brother&#x2019;s murder. It all held together, and he had the scars to prove it.<br><br>&#x201c;I should never have run.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You did the right thing. Your brother told you to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should have stayed to find Maya. She is all I have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give up on your sister.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How could she survive what they do to her? I don&#x2019;t even know where they took her.&#x201d;<br><br>Sonia didn&#x2019;t have an answer, because she didn&#x2019;t know if she could find his sister. Eight days was a long time in the vile underworld, and thirteen-year-old Maya had most likely been sold before she ever set foot in the United States. If she even ended up here. They&#x2019;d been separated during the journey, and Andres had no idea where they&#x2019;d been when she&#x2019;d been taken away. He&#x2019;d ended up being smuggled in by truck, then boat.<br><br>Sonia frowned at Trace. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re worried about a reprimand, I&#x2019;ll tell them I lied to you like I lied to the rest of the team.&#x201d; She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to be dishonest, but she felt as if she had no choice. Her boss wouldn&#x2019;t have authorized this stakeout on the word of a pint-sized illegal immigrant.<br><br>Trace slammed his fist on the ground. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you said that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; She stared through the binoculars at the dark house. She didn&#x2019;t want to hurt Trace, but he hadn&#x2019;t been in the trenches long enough to know how brutal this business was. That the buying and selling of humans was even thought of as a business angered Sonia and kept her focused on the prize: slapping cuffs on Jones and getting him into an interrogation room.<br><br>&#x201c;No you&#x2019;re not. You think you&#x2019;re protecting the team, but you&#x2019;re only hurting yourself. Don&#x2019;t be the martyr, Sonia. You&#x2019;re too damn good. I&#x2019;m a big boy, and I could have told you to fuck off, or told Warner that Vega didn&#x2019;t give you this intel. I backed you up because I trust your instincts.

Red, white, and blue.&#x201d;<br><br>Sonia slammed her fist against the nearest tree trunk. She watched the road and seconds later red and blue lights flashed intermittently through the trees lining the private road off Lake Amador Drive. She heard someone&#x2014;it sounded like veteran Joe Nicholson&#x2014;say, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gonna fuckin&#x2019; blow like Mount Vesuvius.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wish I could see it,&#x201d; his partner replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Wish I were on vacation.&#x201d;<br><br>They were talking about her, and they were right. She had had more problems with the fucking FBI than any other law enforcement agency. And now they&#x2019;d blown her operation. How did they get wind of the stakeout? Why didn&#x2019;t they call and find out if anyone was investigating Jones? They acted as if they were the only federal law enforcement in the country. Jones was ICE territory, and Sonia was going to make damn sure the FBI knew it. Innocent children were going to die if they screwed this up.<br><br>She watched as three black Suburbans drove onto the wide, circular drive in front of Jones&#x2019;s towering home, lights flashing, screeching to a halt as if they were in some B movie.<br><br>Federal heads were going to roll. Sonia would see to it. Personally.<br><br>She issued orders to her team, then turned to Trace. She was about to tell him to stay put, but shut her mouth. He was no longer a rookie, having been with her team for two years. &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be rash.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the first time the Fibbies have screwed up one of our ops.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to tell me that, but don&#x2019;t forget: more flies with honey, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to catch them, I want to swat them.&#x201d;<br><br>She and Trace ran low to the ground toward the residence. They were a good hundred yards or more off, but made it to the rock-strewn edge of the drive through sparse foliage without being seen by the feds. They halted behind a boulder where they could watch the action. Doors opened and at least eight Fibbies oozed from the interior, black bulletproof vests with bold white letters proclaiming their authority: FBI.<br><br>Homeland Security trumped the FBI every time, and she&#x2019;d make sure the idiots who had driven into her stakeout damn well knew it.<br><br>They were dressed in black tactical gear, and she pulled her hat from her pocket that identified her as ICE, peeled down the flap on Trace&#x2019;s back revealing the same acronym, and clipped her badge to her belt. Trace did the same. She motioned to her partner and mouthed &#x201c;On three.&#x201d; They emerged from the large, decorative rocks only feet from the nearest agent. If she had been one of the bad guys, she&#x2019;d have an ideal head shot. Hell, with her weak hand she could have taken out three of them without breaking a sweat. Incompetent jerks. Did they know who they were up against in Xavier Jones?<br><br>She strode toward three agents surveying the layout. One black-vested agent tried to stop her, flashing his badge and saying, &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, we&#x2019;ll have to ask you to speak with&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She pointed to her badge, glanced at the name sewn onto his vest. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s in charge, Ivers? Elliott? Richardson?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>A black-haired agent approached. Sonia recognized Sam Callahan, Sacramento FBI&#x2019;s SSA for white-collar crimes. Political bribery and money laundering. What was he doing here when Jones&#x2019;s crime was far more international&#x2014;and deadly&#x2014;in scope? &#x201c;Callahan. Surprised to see you here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right back at you, Sonia.&#x201d; He nodded at Trace. &#x201c;Anderson.&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t hold back her frustration. &#x201c;You just destroyed nearly two years&#x2019; work!

Motivated partially by his deep-rooted antagonism toward his enemies (both the Northern victors and his Southern detractors), partially by his continuing obsession with the "cause," and partially by his desperate pecuniary and physical condition, Davis devoted three years and extensive research to the writing of what he termed "an historical sketch of the events which preceded and attended the struggle of the Southern states to maintain their existence and their rights as sovereign communities." The result was a perceptive two-volume chronicle, covering the birth, life, and death of the Confederacy, from the Missouri Compromise in 1820, through the tumultuous events of the Civil War, to the readmission of the Southern states to the U.S. Congress in the late 1860s. Supplemented with a new historical foreword by the Pulitzer Prize-winning James M. McPherson, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Volume I</i> belongs in the library of anyone interested in the root causes, the personalities, and the events of America's greatest war.</p><p>Davis devoted three years and extensive research to the writing of what he termed &#39;an historical sketch of the events which preceded and attended the struggle of the Southern states to maintain their existence and their rights as sovereign communities.&#39; The result was this perceptive two-volume chronicle, covering the birth, life, and death of the Confederacy, from the Missouri Compromise in 1820 through the tumultuous events of the Civil War, to the readmission of the Southern States to the U.S. Congress in the late 1860s.<b>Jefferson Davis</b> (1808-1889) was an American politician who served as the only President of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865.</p><h2>Clare of Assisi: A Heart Full of Love</h2><p>Although this is a small book on the spirituality of a medieval woman from a glorious past, it is also a book about Christian life today. Clare's decisive emphasis on the person of Jesus Christ is an emphasis on the human person as well, what we are and what we are called to be. &#x2014;From the Introduction <br><br> <i>Clare of Assisi: A Heart Full of Love</i> explores Clare's deep desire to live the gospel life, more precisely, her desire for all of us to reflect on Christ and his crucifixion in order to see our own strengths and weaknesses, and most importantly, our capacity to love. Ilia Delio illustrates how Clare, through her life, her writings, letters, prayer and example, is truly a mystic who helped generations of Catholics clearly see how Christ took on human flesh, not just to suffer and die for us, but to help us all in turn reflect back the face of Christ to the world. <br><br> Clare was not simply a follower of Francis, she was a formidable, resolute, devout and loving saint whose life centered on this essence of human identity&#x2014;Christ is in each of us&#x2014;and who sought to teach us to just be ourselves and to let God dwell within us. In <i>Clare of Assisi: A Heart Full of Love</i>, Ilia Delio shows us just how Clare's simple, but powerful beliefs transformed the way we all think about Christ&#x2014;even today.</p><p><b>ILIA DELIO,O.S.F.</b>, is associate professor of ecclesiastical history and director of spirituality studies at the Washington Theological Union in Washington, D.C.

Kjell of Jeru had always known who he was. He&#39;d never envied his brother or wanted to be king. He was the bastard son of the late King Zoltev and a servant girl, and the ignominy of his birth had never bothered him. But there is more to a man than his parentage. More to a man than his blade, his size, or his skills, and all that Kjell once knew has shifted and changed. He is no longer simply Kjell of Jeru, a warrior defending the crown. Now he is a healer, one of the Gifted, and a man completely at odds with his power. Called upon to rid the country of the last vestiges of the Volgar, Kjell stumbles upon a woman who has troubling glimpses of the future and no memory of the past. Armed with his unwanted gift and haunted by regret, Kjell becomes a reluctant savior, beset by old enemies and new expectations. With the woman by his side, Kjell embarks upon a journey where the greatest test may be finding the man she believes him to be.</p><p>Amy Harmon is a Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and New York Times Bestselling author.

As always he writes perceptively about a wide range of subjects: the charm of familiar waters, the etiquette of working with new fishing guides, night fishing when the trout and the mosquitoes are both biting, and fishing snobbery, a pitfall he seems to have largely avoided: &#x201c;A friend and I recently realized that making fly-fishing a way of life instead of a hobby has made us a couple of pretty one-dimensional characters. On the other hand, we agreed we&#x2019;re two of the happiest people we know, albeit in a simple-minded sort of way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gierach again demonstrates the wit, eloquence, and insight that have become his trademarks. <i>No Shortage of Good Days </i>is the next best thing to a day of fishing.</p><p>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>, where he is a regular columnist. He also writes a column for the monthly&nbsp;<i>Redstone Review</i>. He lives in Lyons, Colorado.&nbsp;In the same charming style of his previous books, Gierach (Sex, Death, and Fly-Fishing; Still Life with Brook Trout) offers plenty of enthusiasm for nonanglers, but is also full of the firsthand knowledge and sagely guarded secrets that keep fishermen coming back for more. This collection of essays offers envy-inducing travelogues, such as "Baja," "Tennessee," and "Atlantic Salmon," as well as others that focus on the intricacies of "taking someone fishing," such as "The Perfect Host"; others, like "Book Tour," explore the ups and downs of the writing life and publishing business. The most personal look at Gierach, who is both a bamboo-rod snob and free-spirited trout bum, comes in the revealing "Cheating," which covers how anglers "fight over how the fish should be caught" and allows the author to share his biases, transgressions, and some secondhand gems about poaching. No matter the subject, Gierach's prose, complete with catchy one-liners ("the river you see is like a slide show run by a speed freak"; "fishing is like any other quest in the sense that when you finally close the deal, you can be at a loss about what to do next"), combines the naturalist poetics of Norman Maclean and the nascent practicality of Benjamin Franklin.

Sixty percent or more of all chronic disease would be significantly reduced if people would simply keep themselves properly hydrated. To ionize means to gain or lose an electron. Essentially, the ionization process robs an electron from one molecule and donates, or transfers, it to another molecule. Both Alkaline and Acid Ionized Water have extraordinary properties and benefits, however, their respective uses could not be more different. We consume Alkaline Ionized Water and use the Acid Ionized Water on the outside of our bodies for acne, cuts, scrapes and rashes of all kinds. It kills bacteria on contact and encourages plant growth. The centerpiece of Alkaline Ionized Water are its antioxidant properties. It is miraculous that normal tap water can be instantly transformed into a strong antioxidant. Alkaline Ionized Water has two antioxidant qualities, its negative charge and the presence of hydroxyl ions which are free radical scavengers. The body is starved for electrons and Alkaline Ionized Water contains an abundance of them, which nullify free radicals in the body. One can thrive on half the normal intake of food as long as we consume high electron-rich nutrients. Alkaline Ionized Water is an extremely effective antioxidant because it is a liquid that has a small grouping of water molecule clusters and thus is more easily absorbed into the body where it can be of immediate use. Drinking Alkaline Ionized Water gives you energy through better hydration and alkalization of the body and by providing the body with oxygen. Because of the predominance of hydroxyl ions in Alkaline Ionized Water, the water becomes alkaline, meaning it has a high pH. The pH level can be adjusted with a water ionizer between 7.5 and 9.9, which is the highest pH that it should be consumed. All disease thrives in an acid environment in the body and will not flourish and thrive in an alkaline environment. If we acidify</p><p>ORP is the single most important term we need to become familiar with if we want to understand human health and this is the only book ever written that declares this fact and explains it so the average person can easily understand it. ORP is everything and finally a book has been written that explains it for us all. A person's ORP level, although quite difficult to determine reliably, would instantly reveal whether they are in a state of health or disease. ORP is another way to measure the body's vibration. Everything in the universe vibrates. When we are healthy we vibrate within a certain frequency range. If we are sick, we will vibrate at a completely different frequency range, one that reflects our state of unhealthiness or disease.<p></p><p>At 49, I personally am not in physical decline, in large part because I regularly drink Ionized Water. What the rest of my diet is comprised of also determines my current biological age quotient. The cells that make up my body are more active, productive, communicative and functional than those I had when I was supposedly in my prime 30 years ago, although given my health warrior lifestyle I'm definitely in my prime now. The great thing is that 10 years from now I'll still be in my prime and look back at how much healthier I am then compared to today.</p><p></p><p>ORP is a measurement of a substance's ability to either reduce or encourage the oxidation of another substance. When we consume raw foods, they reduce the oxidation of our bodies. Thus, raw foods rejuvenate us. Raw foods are also negatively charged. Cooking raw foods oxidizes them, thus raising their ORP. And when we consume cooked foods, we add to the oxidation of our bodies and accelerate the aging process. Cooked foods burn us up internally by stimulating oxidation since they themselves have already been oxidized with a positive ORP of +400 or higher. Animal protein, fried foods, soft drinks and other highly processed foods possess the highest ORP and therefore greatest amount of hydrogen (positive) ions. A high ORP is an environment where disease thrives because it is also a high acid (low pH) environment. To reduce this oxidation, this slow-burning fire within us, we must consume substances that possess a negative charge such as Ionized Water and raw fruits and vegetables. When we do, the consuming fire of high ORP is extinguished. </p><p>The principals of ORP are the same for Ionized Water. The positive ORP of Acid Ionized Water increases oxidation because it contains hydrogen ions (missing electrons), which is the environment of all disease. The negative charge of Alkaline Ionized Water reduces oxidation because it contains hydroxyl ions (extra electrons), which is an environment that leads to health. </p><p>Consuming Ionized Water bathes the interior of the body in a negatively charged liquid, which promotes rejuvenation of each bodily system at a cellular level. For instance, a liver cell is better able to repair itself in a negative ion, alkaline environment than a positive ion, acid environment. When we consume negatively charged substances such as Ionized Water this oxidation is retarded and our body's cells are in a better position to repair and rejuvenate themselves. Nothing is better for the body.</p>I am considered a "crank" by some, which is aptly defined by Mark Twain as "a person with a new idea until it succeeds." Without fail, there are those who attempt to debunk great advances in every scientific field and Ionized Water is no exception. Debunkers suggest that the ionization of water simply isn't possible. One debunker states that Ionized Water should be dismissed simply because it is too good to be true. Others state that ionization is impossible to verify when in fact its properties are demonstrated using scientific measuring devices such as pH and ORP meters because the changes that ionization produce are radical, immediate and measurable. <p>What health debunkers do best is plant doubt in our minds when we are trying to search out the truth about breakthrough health devices. It's easy to be a skeptic. It's difficult to blaze trails and fly in the face of every conventional thought and precept science has established. Debunkers have a chilling effect on open debate because of the way they often scoff at the technologies they are challenging. Their attack on new health technologies that have not been conducted, sanitized and approved by the medical establishment often extends to the promoter of the new invention. They become the focus of derision much the way Galileo was when he claimed the Sun was the center of the Solar System, not the Earth. Debunkers ridicule those who have found a new path, uncovered a new truth and consequentially have surpassed an old belief system. The water ionizer is a prime example of this kind of attack that stifles progress.</p></p><h2>Lewis &amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery: An Illustrated History</h2><p>The companion volume to Ken Burns's PBS documentary film, with more than 150 illustrations, most in full color.<br><br>In the spring of 1804, at the behest of President Thomas Jefferson, a party of explorers called the Corps of Discovery crossed the Mississippi River and started up the Missouri, heading west into the newly acquired Louisiana Territory.<br><br>The expedition, led by two remarkable and utterly different commanders -- the brilliant but troubled Meriwether Lewis and his trustworthy, gregarious friend William Clark -- was to be the United States' first exploration into unknown spaces. The unlikely crew came from every corner of the young nation: soldiers from New Hampshire and Pennsylvania and Kentucky, French Canadian boatmen, several sons of white fathers and Indian mothers, a slave named York, and eventually a Shoshone Indian woman, Sacagawea, who brought along her infant son.<br><br>Together they would cross the continent, searching for the fabled Northwest Passage that had been the great dream of explorers since the time of Columbus. Along the way they would face incredible hardship, disappointment, and danger; record in their journals hundreds of animals and plants previously unknown to science; encounter a dizzying diversity of Indian cultures; and, most of all, share in one of America's most enduring adventures. Their story may have passed into national mythology, but never before has their experience been rendered as vividly, in words and pictures, as in this marvelous homage by Dayton Duncan. <br><br>Plentiful excerpts from the journals kept by the two captains and four enlisted men convey the raw emotions, turbulent spirits, and constant surprises of the explorers, who each day confronted the unknown with fresh eyes. An elegant preface by Ken Burns, as well as contributions from Stephen E. Ambrose, William Least Heat-Moon, and Erica Funkhouser, enlarge upon important threads in Duncan's narrative, demonstrating the continued potency of events that took place almost two centuries ago. And a wealth of paintings, photographs, journal sketches, maps, and film images from the PBS documentary lends this historic, nation-redefining milestone a vibrancy and immediacy to which no American will be immune.</p><p>Having chronicled the Civil War and baseball, among other subjects, filmmaker Ken Burns collaborates with historian Dayton Duncan to craft this moving portrait of the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804-6. The story is one of individual triumph and tragedy, and its cast members--a slave, several women who save the expedition at key moments, and veterans of a bitterly fought revolution--represent the early Republic in microcosm. Packed with well-chosen illustrations, <i>Lewis &amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery</i> is a fine synthesis of what we know about Meriwether Lewis and William Clark today, knowledge that remains shrouded in a certain mystery.Dayton Duncan, writer and producer of <b>Lewis &amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery</b>, is the author of five other books, including <b>Out West: An American Journey along the Lewis and Clark Trail</b>, in which he retraced the route of the expedition.

More and more horse people are discovering the incredible rewards of training a well�balanced mount, using a soft feel, and developing communication based on kindness and cooperation.</p> <p>In this remarkable book, the founder of Cowboy Dressage� Eitan Beth�Halachmy explains the development of the Western dressage horse using his methods. Beginning with the basics of body language, use of the aids, and a discussion of the Training Pyramid, Beth�Halachmy then provides guidelines for foundational groundwork and progressive dressage schooling under saddle, such as developing cadence and consistency in the gaits, understanding and requesting correct bend, choosing and using lateral maneuvers, and advancing self�carriage and collection. Additional sections highlight the distinct benefits of the geometry of the Cowboy Dressage Court, the intrigue of training with the <i>garrocha</i> (a long pole or lance), and the great pleasure of riding musical freestyles. This fantastic guide is both valuable resource and inspirational touchstone, promising that in the end, horse and rider enjoy each other's company.</p></p><p>Eitan Beth�Halachmy was born in Israel, where a Hungarian Cavalry Officer instilled in him a regard for horses and horsemanship that remains the foundation of this training methods and philosophy today. After attending the University of Vienna with a focus on pre�veterinary medicine, Beth�Halachmy came to the United States to pursue his studies at the University of California at Davis. However, while in Vienna he had spent much time observing at the Spanish Riding School, and once in California, he realized what he really wanted to do was train horses. Beth�Halachmy has won many world and national titles in the show horse industry. He and the Morgan stallions Holiday Compadre and Santa Fe Renegade were named World Champions multiple times. Beth�Halachmy is now best known for and spends his time promoting Cowboy Dressage, a riding discipline in which he applies his years of childhood training in classical dressage to Western horsemanship. Beth�Halachmy and his wife Debbie Beth�Halachmy own and operate Wolf Creek Ranch in the beautiful Sierra Foothills in Grass Valley, California. Together they work to spread the Cowboy Dressage movement's ideals of lightness and kindness as reward in horse training (www.cowboydressage.com).<br><br>Dr. Jenni Grimmett is a graduate of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University. She has been an avid horsewoman since the age of eight when she got her first pony, competing in all manner of events, from barrel racing to saddle seat to Western pleasure to hunt seat�all on the back of a Morgan horse. Dr. Grimmett became involved with Cowboy Dressage in 2011 and has been avidly pursing its ideals of horse training through soft feel and kindness ever since. Dr. Grimmett is a popular blogger and teaches Cowboy Dressage from her ranch in Sagle, Idaho, when she has time away from her busy rural equine veterinary practice."From the basics and groundwork to lateral maneuvers and the consistency of gaits under saddle, this book has step-by-step exercises to accommodate you each step of the way, while adding an inspirational tone and a hopeful outlook after each chapters.

I decided to offer it to the Saints (my brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus) at the lowest price possible. More info is available at wisdombooks.faith. This is a paperback, perfect bound book set in 9pt Roman font. Contains both old and new testament. No apocrypha. No notes, just the word of God. When the Geneva translation of the New Testament appeared in 1557 and the entire Bible in 1560, it was innovative in both text and format, and quickly became the household Bible of English speaking people. It was the first English Bible to have modern verse divisions as well as modern chapter divisions. It was the first Bible to use italics to indicate words not in the original language and the first Bible to change the values of ancient coins into English pound sterling equivalents. It was also the first to use plain Roman type, which was more readable than the old Gothic type, and it was in a handy quarto size for easy use. With prologues before each book, extensive marginal notes, and a brief concordance, the Geneva Bible was in fact the first English &#34;study Bible.&#34; Between its first edition of 1560 and its last edition in 1644, 160 editions, totaling around a half million Bibles, were produced. And for the first time common people could not only understand the words in the Bible, they could actually own one. Its widespread use first solidified the English language among the common people, not the 1611 King James Bible as many assume. Actually, the King James Bible required decades to surpass the popularity of the Geneva and supplant it from the hearts of the English speaking world. In fact, the Geneva Bible was the principal English Bible initially brought to American soil, making it the Bible that shaped early American life and impacted Colonial culture more than any other. Whittingham included a preface entitled, &#34;To the Reader Mercy and peace through Christ our Savior.&#34; It reads: In the Church of Christ there are three kinds of men: some are malicious despisers of the Word and graces of God, who turn all things into poison, and a further hardening of their hearts: others do not openly resist and contemn [condemn] the Gospel, because they are struck as it were in a trance with the majesty thereof, yet either they quarrel and cavil, or else deride and mock at whatsoever is done for the advancement of the same. The third sort are simple lambs which partly are already in the fold of Christ, and so willingly hear their Shepherds voice, and partly wandering astray by ignorance tarry the time till the Shepherd find them and bring them unto His flock. To this kind of people in this translation I chiefly had respect, as moved unto zeal, counseled by the godly, and drawn by occasion, both of the place where God hath appointed us to dwell, and also to the store of heavenly learning and judgment which so abounded in this city of Geneva, that justly it may be called the patron and mirror of true religion and godliness.</p><p></p><h2>Our Republican Constitution: Securing the Liberty and Sovereignty of We the People</h2><p><p>A concise history of the long struggle between two fundamentally opposing constitutional traditions, from one of the nation&#x2019;s leading constitutional scholars&#x2014;a manifesto for renewing our constitutional republic.</p><p>The Constitution of the United States begins with the words: &#x201c;We the People.&#x201d; But from the earliest days of the American republic, there have been two competing notions of &#x201c;the People,&#x201d; which lead to two very different visions of the Constitution.</p><p>Those who view &#x201c;We the People&#x201d; collectively think popular sovereignty resides in the people as a group, which leads them to favor a &#x201c;democratic&#x201d; constitution that allows the &#x201c;will of the people&#x201d; to be expressed by majority rule. In contrast, those who think popular sovereignty resides in the people as individuals contend that a &#x201c;republican&#x201d; constitution is needed to secure the pre-existing inalienable rights of &#x201c;We the People,&#x201d; each and every one, against abuses by the majority.</p><p>In Our Republican Constitution, renowned legal scholar Randy E. Barnett tells the fascinating story of how this debate arose shortly after the Revolution, leading to the adoption of a new and innovative &#x201c;republican&#x201d; constitution; and how the struggle over slavery led to its completion by a newly formed Republican Party.

Some of us live in blue states and watch CNN; others live in red states and watch Fox News. Some Americans want more government, others less. We engage in passionate debate over issues like gun control, health care, same-sex marriage, immigration, and the war on terrorism. But above all, says renowned legal scholar Randy E. Barnett, we are in fundamental disagreement about the Constitution.</p><p>From the early days of the American republic, the nature of government &#x201c;of the people, by the people, for the people&#x201d; has been disputed. This is because there are not one but two very different notions of &#x201c;We the People&#x201d; and popular sovereignty, which yield competing schools of constitutional thought. The democrats view We the People collectively and think popular sovereignty resides in the people as a group. They view the Constitution as a living document and contend that today&#x2019;s majority should not be governed by the dead hand of past majorities. </p><p>The republicans view We the People as a collection of individuals. Their vision of government is that it should not reflect the will of the majority&#x2014;but rather secure the preexisting rights of each and every person to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p><p>This fundamental disagreement lies at the heart of our current national divide. In <em>Our Republican Constitution</em>, Barnett tells the fascinating story of how this conflict arose shortly after the Revolution, leading to the adoption of a new and innovative republican constitution; and how the struggle and eventual victory over slavery led to its improvement by a newly formed Republican Party. Yet soon after, progressive academics and activists urged the courts to remake it into a democratic constitution by ignoring key passages of its text. And eventually the courts complied. </p><p>Luckily, this debate is far from over. Drawing from his deep knowledge of constitutional law and history&#x2014;as well as his experience litigating on behalf of medical marijuana and against Obamacare&#x2014;Barnett explains why We the People would benefit greatly from the renewal of our Republican Constitution, and how this can be accomplished in the courts and political arena.</p><p>Advance Praise For <em>Our Republican Constitution</em></p><p>&#x201c;Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett is a rarity in academia.

Though they left with no money, and no one was seriously injured, Terrence was sentenced to die in prison for his involvement in that crime.<br><br>As shocking as Terrence's sentence sounds, it is merely a symptom of contemporary American juvenile justice practices. In the United States, adolescents are routinely transferred out of juvenile court and into adult criminal court without any judicial oversight. Once in adult court, children can be sentenced without regard for their youth. Juveniles are housed in adult correctional facilities, they may be held in solitary confinement, and they experience the highest rates of sexual and physical assault among inmates. Until 2005, children convicted in America's courts were subject to the death penalty; today, they still may be sentenced to die in prison-no matter what efforts they make to rehabilitate themselves. America has waged a war on kids. <br><br>In <em>The War on Kids</em>, Cara Drinan reveals how the United States went from being a pioneer to an international pariah in its juvenile sentencing practices. Academics and journalists have long recognized the failings of juvenile justice practices in this country and have called for change. Despite the uncertain political climate, there is hope that recent Supreme Court decisions may finally make those calls a reality. <em>The War on Kids</em> seizes upon this moment of judicial and political recognition that children are different in the eyes of the law. Drinan chronicles the shortcomings of juvenile justice by drawing upon social science, legal decisions, and first-hand correspondence with Terrence and others like him-individuals whose adolescent errors have cost them their lives. At the same time, <em>The War on Kids </em>maps out concrete steps that states can take to correct the course of American juvenile justice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Cara Drinan</strong> is a Professor of Law at Catholic University and a nationally recognized expert on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, juvenile sentencing, and criminal justice reform. She is especially interested in giving voice to those whose lives have been shaped by the mass incarceration phenomenon.<br><br>"this book is highly recommended for readers who are interested in an accessible yet comprehensive book about the juvenile justice system in the U.S." -- Rong Bai and Robert Fischer, <em>Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare</em><p></p><br>"This is a well-written book that conveys the harsh reality of criminal justice practices and legal doctrines in a way accessible to non-lawyers and the broader public." -- <em>Criminal Law and Criminal Justice Books</em><p></p><br>"A clear, concise, well-organized call for action designed to reach a general audience." - Kirkus Reviews <br><p></p><br>"Drinan outlines a compelling and urgent case for U.S. juvenile justice reform.

Symptoms of decline are all around us today: slowing growth, crushing debts, increasing inequality, aging populations, antisocial behavior. But what exactly has gone wrong? The answer, Niall Ferguson argues in <i>The Great Degeneration</i>, is that our institutions&#x2014;the intricate frameworks within which a society can flourish or fail&#x2014;are degenerating. With characteristic verve and historical insight, Ferguson analyzes the causes of this stagnation and its profound consequences for the future of the West. <i>The Great Degeneration</i> is an incisive indictment of an era of negligence and complacency&#x2014;and to arrest the breakdown of our civilization, Ferguson warns, will take heroic leadership and radical reform.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is one of the world's most renowned historians. He is the author of <i>Paper and Iron, The House of Rothschild, The Pity of War, The Cash Nexus, Empire, Colossus, The War of the World, The Ascent of Money, High Financier, Civilization, The Great Degeneration, Kissinger, 1923-1968: The Idealist, </i>and<i> The Square and the Tower</i>. He is Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing. His many awards include the Benjamin Franklin Prize for Public Service (2010), the Hayek Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2012) and the Ludwig Erhard Prize for Economic Journalism (2013).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost a quarter of a century ago, in the summer of 1989, Francis Fukuyama could boldly predict &#x2018;an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Triumph of the West&#x2019; and proclaim that &#x2018;the end point of mankind&#x2019;s ideological evolution&#x2019; was &#x2018;the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government&#x2019;.1 How different the world looks now. &#x2018;Economic liberalism&#x2019; is a tarnished brand, while the proponents of &#x2018;state capitalism&#x2019; in China and elsewhere openly deride Western democracy. The West is stagnating, and not only in economic terms. In 2013 the World Bank expected the European economy to contract and the US to grow by just 1.6 per cent. China would grow four times faster than that, India two and a half times faster. By 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund, the gross domestic product of China would approach that of the United States.* Those who invested in the West in 1989 have been punished (they have made nothing since 2000), while those who invested in the Rest have been richly rewarded. This &#x2018;great reconvergence&#x2019; is a far more astonishing historical event than the collapse of communism that Fukuyama so astutely anticipated. At the time he wrote, the world&#x2019;s centre of economic gravity was still firmly in the North Atlantic. Today it is beyond the Urals, and by 2025 it will be just north of Kazakhstan&nbsp;&#x2013; on roughly the same line of latitude as it was in 1500, on the eve of Western ascendancy.2</p><p>The voguish explanation for the Western slowdown is &#x2018;deleveraging&#x2019;: the painful process of debt reduction (or balance sheet repair). Certainly, there are few precedents for the scale of debt in the West today. This is only the second time in American history that combined public and private debt has exceeded 250 per cent of GDP. In a survey of fifty countries, the McKinsey Global Institute identifies forty-five episodes of deleveraging since 1930. In only eight was the initial debt/GDP ratio above 250 per cent, as it is today not only in the US but also in all the major English-speaking countries (including Australia and Canada), all the major continental European countries (including Germany), plus Japan and South Korea.3 The deleveraging argument is that households and banks are struggling to reduce their debts, having gambled foolishly on ever rising property prices. But as people have sought to spend less and save more, aggregate demand has slumped. To prevent this process from generating a lethal debt deflation, governments and central banks have stepped in with fiscal and monetary stimulus unparalleled in time of peace. Public sector deficits have helped to mitigate the contraction, but they risk transforming a crisis of excess private debt into a crisis of excess public debt. In the same way, the expansion of central bank balance sheets (the monetary base) prevented a cascade of bank failures, but now appears to have diminishing returns in terms of reflation and growth.</p><p>Yet more is going on here than just deleveraging. Consider this: the US economy created 2.4 million jobs in the three years beginning in June 2009. In the same period, 3.3 million Americans were awarded disabled worker benefits. The percentage of working-age Americans collecting disability insurance has risen from below 3 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent.4 Unemployment is being concealed &#x2013; and rendered permanent&nbsp;&#x2013; in ways all too familiar to Europeans. Able-bodied people are classified as disabled and never work again. And they also stay put. Traditionally around 3 per cent of the US population moves to a new state each year, usually in pursuit of work. That rate has halved since the financial crisis began in 2007. Social mobility has also declined. And, unlike the Great Depression of the 1930s, our &#x2018;Slight Depression&#x2019; is doing little to reduce the yawning inequality in income distribution that has developed over the past three decades. The income share of the top 1 per cent of households rose from 9 per cent in 1970 to 24 per cent in 2007. It declined by less than 4 percentage points in the subsequent three years of crisis.</p><p>You cannot blame all this on deleveraging. In the United States, the wider debate is about globalization, technological change, education and fiscal policy. Conservatives tend to emphasize the first and second as inexorable drivers of change, destroying low-skilled jobs by &#x2018;offshoring&#x2019; or automating them. Liberals prefer to see widening inequality as the result of insufficient investment in public education, combined with Republican reductions in taxation that have favoured the wealthy.5 But there is good reason to think that there are other forces at work&nbsp;&#x2013; forces that tend to get overlooked in the slanging match that passes for political debate in the United States today.</p><p>The crisis of public finance is not uniquely American. Japan, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal are also members of the club of countries with public debts in excess of 100 per cent of GDP. India had an even larger cyclically adjusted deficit than the United States in 2010, while Japan faced a bigger challenge to stabilize its debt/GDP ratio at a sustainable level.6 Nor are the twin problems of slow growth and widening inequality confined to the United States. Throughout the English-speaking world, the income share of the top &#x2018;1 per cent&#x2019; of households has risen since around 1980. The same thing has happened, albeit to a lesser extent, in some European states, notably Finland, Norway and Portugal, as well as in many emerging markets, including China.7 Already in 2010 there were at least 800,000 dollar millionaires in China and sixty-five billionaires. Of the global &#x2018;1 per cent&#x2019; in 2010, 1.6 million were Chinese, approaching 4 per cent of the total.8 Yet other countries, including Europe&#x2019;s most successful economy, Germany, have not become more unequal, while some less developed countries, notably Argentina, have become less equal without becoming more global.</p><p>By definition, globalization has affected all countries to some degree. So, too, has the revolution in information technology. Yet the outcomes in terms of growth and distribution vary hugely. To explain these differences, a narrowly economic approach is not sufficient. Take the case of excessive debt or leverage. Any highly indebted economy confronts a narrow range of options. There are essentially three:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;raising the rate of growth above the rate of interest thanks to technological innovation and (perhaps) a judicious use of monetary stimulus;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;defaulting on a large proportion of the public debt and going into bankruptcy to escape the private debt; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;wiping out of debts via currency depreciation and inflation.<p>But nothing in mainstream economic theory can predict which of these three&nbsp;&#x2013; or which combination&nbsp;&#x2013; a particular country will select. Why did post-1918 Germany go down the road of hyperinflation? Why did post-1929 America go down the road of private default and bankruptcy? Why not the other way round? At the time of writing, it seems less and less likely that any major developed economy will be able to inflate away its liabilities as happened in many cases in the 1920s and 1950s.9 But why not? Milton Friedman&#x2019;s famous dictum that inflation is &#x2018;always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon&#x2019; leaves unanswered the questions of who creates the excess money and why they do it. In practice, inflation is primarily a <i>political</i> phenomenon. Its likelihood is a function of factors like the content of elite education; competition (or the lack of it) in an economy; the character of the legal system; levels of violence; and the political decision-making process itself. Only by historical methods can we explain why, over the past thirty years, so many countries created forms of debt that, by design, cannot be inflated away; and why, as a result, the next generation will be saddled for life with liabilities incurred by their parents and grandparents.</p><p>In the same way, it is easy to explain why the financial crisis was caused by excessively large and leveraged financial institutions, but much harder to explain why, after more than four years of debate, the problem of &#x2018;too big to fail&#x2019; banks has not been solved. Indeed, despite the passage of legislation covering literally thousands of pages, it has got markedly worse.10 Today, a mere ten highly diversified financial institutions are responsible for three-quarters of total financial assets under management in the United States. Yet the country&#x2019;s largest banks are at least $50 billion short of meeting new capital requirements under the new &#x2018;Basel III&#x2019; accords governing bank capital adequacy. Again, only a political and historical approach can explain why Western politicians today call simultaneously for banks to lend more money and for them to shrink their balance sheets.</p><p>Why is it now a hundred times more expensive to bring a new medicine to market than it was sixty years ago&nbsp;&#x2013; a phenomenon Juan Enriquez has called &#x2018;Moore&#x2019;s Law* in reverse&#x2019;? Why would the Food and Drug Administration probably prohibit the sale of table salt if it were put forward as a new pharmacological product (it is after all toxic in large doses)?11 Why, to give another suggestive example, did it take an American journalist sixty-five days to get official permission (including, after a wait of up to five weeks, a Food Protection Certificate) to open a lemonade stand in New York City?12 This is the kind of debilitating red tape that development economists often blame for poverty in Africa or Latin America. The rationale for the FDA&#x2019;s rigid standards is to avoid the sale of a drug like thalidomide. But the unintended consequence is almost certainly to allow many more people to die prematurely than would have died from side-effects under a less restrictive regime. We count and recount the costs of such side-effects. We do not count the costs of not allowing new drugs to be made available.</p><p>Why exactly has social mobility declined in the United States in the past thirty years, so that the probability has more than halved that a man born into the bottom 25 per cent of the income distribution will end his life in the top quartile?13 Once the United States was famed as a land of opportunity, where a family could leap from &#x2018;rags to riches&#x2019; in a generation. But today, if you are born to parents in the bottom income quintile, you have just a 5 per cent chance of getting into the top quintile without a college degree. What Charles Murray has called the &#x2018;cognitive elite&#x2019;, educated at exclusive private universities, intermarried and congregated in a few &#x2018;super zip codes&#x2019;, looks increasingly like a new caste, equipped with the wealth and power to override the effects of mean reversion in human reproduction, so that even their dimmer progeny inherit their lifestyle.14</p><p>The Stationary State</p><p>In two seldom quoted passages of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Adam Smith described what he called &#x2018;the stationary state&#x2019;: the condition of a formerly wealthy country that had ceased to grow. What were the characteristics of this state? Significantly, Smith singled out its socially regressive character. First, wages for the majority of people were miserably low:</p><p>Though the wealth of a country should be very great, yet if it has been long stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour very high in it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is in reality the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the society. The stationary is dull; the declining melancholy.15</p><p>The second hallmark of the stationary state was the ability of a corrupt and monopolistic elite to exploit the system of law and administration to their own advantage:</p><p>In a country too, where, though the rich or the owners of large capitals enjoy a good deal of security, the poor or the owners of small capitals enjoy scarce any, but are liable, under the pretence of justice, to be pillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior mandarins, the quantity of stock employed in all the different branches of business transacted within it can never be equal to what the nature and extent of that business might admit. In every different branch, the oppression of the poor must establish the monopoly of the rich, who, by engrossing the whole trade to themselves, will be able to make very large profits.16</p><p>I defy the Western reader not to feel an uneasy sense of recognition in contemplating those two passages.</p><p>In Smith&#x2019;s day, of course, it was China that had been &#x2018;long stationary&#x2019;: a once &#x2018;opulent&#x2019; country that had simply ceased to grow. Smith blamed China&#x2019;s defective &#x2018;laws and institutions&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; including its bureaucracy&nbsp;&#x2013; for the stasis. More free trade, more encouragement for small business, less bureaucracy and less crony capitalism: these were Smith&#x2019;s prescriptions to cure Chinese stasis. He was a witness to what such reforms were doing in the late eighteenth century to galvanize the economy of the British Isles and its American colonies. Today, by contrast, if Smith could revisit those same places, he would behold an extraordinary reversal of fortunes. It is we Westerners who are in the stationary state, while China is growing faster than any other major economy in the world. The boot of economic history is on the other foot.</p><p>This book is about the causes of our stationary state. It is inspired by Smith&#x2019;s insight that both stagnation and growth are in large measure the results of &#x2018;laws and institutions&#x2019;. Its central thesis is that what was true of China in Smith&#x2019;s day is true of large parts of the Western world in our time. It is our laws and institutions that are the problem. The Great Recession is merely a symptom of a more profound Great Degeneration.</p><p>The Four Black Boxes</p><p>To demonstrate that Western institutions have indeed degenerated, I am going to have to open up some long-sealed black boxes. The first is the one labelled &#x2018;democracy&#x2019;. The second is labelled &#x2018;capitalism&#x2019;. The third is &#x2018;the rule of law&#x2019;. And the fourth is &#x2018;civil society&#x2019;. Together, they are the key components of our civilization. I want to show that inside these political, economic, legal and social black boxes are highly complex sets of interlocking institutions. Like the circuit boards inside your computer or your smartphone, it is these institutions that make the gadget work. And if it stops working, it is probably because of a defect in the institutional wiring. You cannot understand what is wrong just by looking at the shiny casing. You need to look inside.</p><p>Perhaps, on reflection, that electronic metaphor is the wrong one. After all, most institutions evolve organically; they are not designed in California by the historical equivalent of Steve Jobs. A better analogy might be with the collective structures we see in the natural world. Beehives are the classic example.

Yet, it's no more profound, in the end, than the personal dilemmas protagonist Billy Chapel faces in this, Shaara's final novel, found stashed in a desk after his death and published posthumously.<p> A certain Hall of Famer, Chapel is a major-league anomaly, a contemporary throwback to another sporting era. He's pitched 17 stellar seasons for the same club, and his love of the game has remained paramount; neither money nor fame has been his motivation. But on the single day this story takes place, he finds himself in crisis. At the crossroads of his life, his career, and his future, he must make the hard choices that will define the direction of the rest of his life. It's the end of the season, his team's out of contention, there's a rumor he may have been traded, and the woman he can't fully acknowledge that he loves announces she's leaving him. It is, as he tells himself, "Time to grow up, Daydreamer." Still, he dreams, but he also acts. As Billy takes the mound for his final start of the year--and maybe forever--we enter his stream of consciousness, and rush with him over the sometimes treacherous rapids of what has preceded this moment, and what may come. Amazingly, though his mind seems to wander through time, his concentration is fierce. Pitch by pitch, inning by inning, he remains focused, honoring his job and his legacy as he pitches a masterpiece of mythic proportion, ultimately leaving the field more a man than when he took it. Using baseball to sound the depths of human experience, Shaara delivers a masterpiece, as well. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><br>"Moving, beautiful . . .

It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates, narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the sun and the analogy of the divided line. All three are characterized in relation to dialectic at the end of Books VII and VIII. Plato has Socrates describe a gathering of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from things passing in front of a fire behind them, and they begin to give names to these shadows. The shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall do not make up reality at all, for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners. Socrates remarks that this allegory can be taken with what was said before, namely the analogy of the sun and the analogy of the divided line. In particular, he likens our perception of the world around us "to the habitation in prison, the firelight there to the sunlight here, the ascent and the view of the upper world [to] the rising of the soul into the world of the mind".</p><p>Plato</p><h2>Getting Through the Day: Strategies for Adults Hurt as Children</h2><p><strong>Early abuse can have a profound effect on adult life, especially when survivors struggle with dissociative responses, which range from "trancing out" under stress to the switching of personalities seen in multiples.</strong><p></p>This book enables adults who were traumatized as children to learn new strategies to meet the demands of daily living.

The color of the chair was espresso. Not brown. Richard had been very exact about that sort of thing. The desk itself, so sleek and shiny, was African zebra wood, and custom-made for him in Italy.</p><p>When she&#x2019;d said&#x2014;just a joke&#x2014;that she didn&#x2019;t know they had zebras in Italy, he&#x2019;d given her <i>that</i> look. The look that told her despite the big house, the fancy clothes and the fat diamond on the fourth finger of her left hand, she&#x2019;d always be Shelby Anne Pomeroy, two steps out of the bumpkin town in Tennessee where she was born and raised.</p><p>He&#x2019;d have laughed once, she thought now, he&#x2019;d have known she was joking and laughed as if she were the sparkle in his life. But oh God, she&#x2019;d dulled in his eyes, and so fast, too.</p><p>The man she&#x2019;d met nearly five years before on a starry summer night had swept her off her feet, away from everything she&#x2019;d known, into worlds she&#x2019;d barely imagined.</p><p>He&#x2019;d treated her like a princess, shown her places she&#x2019;d only read about in books or seen in movies. And he&#x2019;d loved her once&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t he? It was important to remember that. He&#x2019;d loved her, wanted her, given her all any woman could ask for.</p><p>Provided. That was a word he&#x2019;d often used. He&#x2019;d provided for her.</p><p>Maybe he&#x2019;d been upset when she got pregnant, maybe she&#x2019;d been afraid&#x2014;just for a minute&#x2014;of the look in his eyes when she told him. But he&#x2019;d married her, hadn&#x2019;t he? Whisked her off to Las Vegas like they were having the adventure of a lifetime.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been happy then. It was important to remember that now, too. She had to remember that, to hold tight the memories of the good times.</p><p>A woman widowed at twenty-four needed memories.</p><p>A woman who learned she&#x2019;d been living a lie, was not only broke but in terrible, breathtaking debt, needed reminders of the good times.</p><p>The lawyers and accountants and tax people explained it all to her, but they might as well have been speaking Greek when they went on about leveraging and hedge funds and foreclosures. The big house, one that had intimidated her since she&#x2019;d walked in the door, wasn&#x2019;t hers&#x2014;or not enough hers to matter&#x2014;but the mortgage company&#x2019;s. The cars, leased not bought, and with the payments overdue, not hers, either.</p><p>The furniture? Bought on credit, and those payments overdue.</p><p>And the taxes. She couldn&#x2019;t bear to think about the taxes. It terrified her to think of them.</p><p>In the two months and eight days since Richard&#x2019;s death, it seemed all she did was think about matters he&#x2019;d told her not to worry about, matters that weren&#x2019;t her concern. Matters, when he&#x2019;d give her <i>that</i> look, that were none of her business.</p><p>Now it was all her concern, and all her business, because she owed creditors, a mortgage company and the United States government so much money it paralyzed her.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t afford to be paralyzed. She had a child, she had a daughter. Callie was all that mattered now. She was only three, Shelby thought, and wanted to lay her head down on that slick, shiny desk and weep.</p><p>&#x201c;But you won&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re what she&#x2019;s got now, so you&#x2019;ll do whatever has to be done.&#x201d;</p><p>She opened one of the boxes, the one marked &#x201c;Personal Papers.&#x201d; The lawyers and tax people had taken everything, gone through everything, copied everything, she supposed.</p><p>Now she would go through everything, and see what could be salvaged. For Callie.</p><p>She needed to find enough, somewhere, to provide for her child after she&#x2019;d paid off all the debt. She&#x2019;d get work, of course, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be enough.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t care about the money, she thought as she began going through receipts for suits and shoes and restaurants and hotels. For private planes. She&#x2019;d learned she didn&#x2019;t care about the money after the first whirlwind year, after Callie.</p><p>After Callie all she&#x2019;d wanted was a home.</p><p>She stopped, looked around Richard&#x2019;s office. The harsh colors of the modern art he&#x2019;d preferred, the stark white walls he said best showed off that art, and the dark woods and leathers.</p><p>This wouldn&#x2019;t be home, and hadn&#x2019;t been. Would never be, she thought, if she lived here eighty years instead of the scant three months since they&#x2019;d moved in.</p><p>He&#x2019;d bought it without consulting her, furnished it without asking what she&#x2019;d like. A surprise, he&#x2019;d said, throwing open the doors to this monster house in Villanova, this echoing building in what he&#x2019;d claimed was the <i>best</i> of the Philadelphia suburbs.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d pretended to love it, hadn&#x2019;t she? Grateful for a settled place, however much the hard colors and towering ceilings intimidated. Callie would have a home, go to good schools, play in a safe neighborhood.</p><p>Make friends. She&#x2019;d make friends, too&#x2014;that had been her hope.</p><p>But there hadn&#x2019;t been time.</p><p>Just as there wasn&#x2019;t a ten-million-dollar life insurance policy. He&#x2019;d lied about that, too. Lied about the college fund for Callie.</p><p>Why?</p><p>She put that question aside. She&#x2019;d never know the answer, so why ask why?</p><p>She could take his suits and shoes and ties and his sports equipment, the golf clubs and skis. Take all those to consignment shops. Take what she could get there.</p><p>Take whatever they didn&#x2019;t repossess and sell it. On damn eBay if she had to. Or Craigslist. Or a pawnshop, it didn&#x2019;t matter.</p><p>Plenty in her own closet to sell. And jewelry, too.</p><p>She looked at the diamond, the ring he&#x2019;d slipped on her finger when they got to Vegas. The wedding ring, she&#x2019;d keep, but the diamond, she&#x2019;d sell. There was plenty of her own to sell.</p><p>For Callie.</p><p>She went through files, one by one. They&#x2019;d taken all the computers, and those she didn&#x2019;t have back yet. But the actual paper was tangible.</p><p>She opened his medical file.</p><p>He&#x2019;d taken good care of himself, she thought&#x2014;which reminded her to cancel the memberships at the country club, at the fitness center. That had gone out of her mind. He&#x2019;d been a healthy man, one who kept his body in tune, who never missed a checkup.</p><p>She needed to toss out all those vitamins and supplements he&#x2019;d taken daily, she decided as she turned over another paper.</p><p>No reason to keep those, no reason to keep these records, either. The healthy man had drowned in the Atlantic, just a few miles off the South Carolina coast, at the age of thirty-three.</p><p>She should just shred all this. Richard had been big on shredding and had his own machine right there in the office. Creditors didn&#x2019;t need to see the results of his last routine blood work or the confirmation of his flu shot from two years ago, paperwork from the emergency room from when he&#x2019;d dislocated his finger playing basketball.</p><p>For God&#x2019;s sake, that had been three years ago. For a man who&#x2019;d shred enough paperwork to make a mountain range, he&#x2019;d sure been possessive about his medical receipts.</p><p>She sighed, noting another, dated almost four years ago. She started to toss it aside, stopped and frowned. She didn&#x2019;t know this doctor. Of course, they&#x2019;d been living in that big high-rise in Houston then, and who could keep track of doctors the way they&#x2019;d moved every year&#x2014;sometimes less than that. But this doctor was in New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be right,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Why would Richard go to a doctor in New York for a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Everything went cold. Her mind, her heart, her belly. Her fingers trembled as she lifted the paper, brought it closer as if the words would change with the distance.</p><p>But they stayed the same.</p><p>Richard Andrew Foxworth had elective surgery, performed by Dr. Dipok Haryana at Mount Sinai Medical Center, on July 12, 2011. A vasectomy.</p><p>He&#x2019;d had a vasectomy, without telling her. Callie barely two months old and he&#x2019;d fixed it so there could be no more children. He&#x2019;d pretended to want more when she&#x2019;d begun talking about another. He&#x2019;d agreed to get checked, as she got checked, when, after a year of trying, she hadn&#x2019;t conceived.</p><p>She could hear him now.</p><p><i>You&#x2019;ve just got to relax, Shelby, for God&#x2019;s sake. If you&#x2019;re worried and tense about it, it&#x2019;ll never happen.</i></p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;ll never happen, because you fixed it so it couldn&#x2019;t. You lied to me, even about that. Lied when my heart broke every month.</p><p>&#x201c;How could you? How could you?&#x201d;</p><p>She pushed away from the desk, pressed her fingers to her eyes. July, mid-July, and Callie about eight weeks old. A business trip, he&#x2019;d said, that&#x2019;s right, she remembered very well. To New York&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t lied about the where.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to take the baby to the city&#x2014;he&#x2019;d known she wouldn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;d made all the arrangements. Another surprise for her. He&#x2019;d sent her back to Tennessee on a private plane, her and her baby.</p><p>So she could spend some time with her family, he&#x2019;d said. Show off the baby, let her mother and grandmother spoil her and spoil Callie for a couple of weeks.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been so happy, so <i>grateful</i>, she thought now. And all the while he&#x2019;d just been getting her out of the way so he could make certain he didn&#x2019;t father another child.</p><p>She walked back to the desk, picked up the photo she&#x2019;d had framed for him. One of her and Callie, taken by her brother Clay on that very trip. A thank-you gift he&#x2019;d seemed to value as he&#x2019;d kept it on his desk&#x2014;wherever they&#x2019;d been&#x2014;ever since.</p><p>&#x201c;Another lie. Just another lie. You never loved us. You couldn&#x2019;t have lied and lied and lied if you&#x2019;d loved us.&#x201d;</p><p>On the rage of betrayal she nearly smashed the frame on the desk. Only the face of her baby stopped her. She set it down again, as carefully as she might priceless and fragile porcelain.</p><p>Then she lowered to the floor&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t sit behind that desk, not now. She sat on the floor with harsh colors against hard white walls, rocking, weeping. Weeping not because the man she&#x2019;d loved was dead, but because he never existed.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>THERE WAS NO TIME TO SLEEP. Though she disliked coffee, she made herself an oversized mug from Richard&#x2019;s Italian machine&#x2014;and hit it with a double shot of espresso.</p><p>Headachy from the crying jag, wired up on caffeine, she combed through every paper in the box, making piles.</p><p>Hotel and restaurant receipts when viewed with newly opened eyes told her he hadn&#x2019;t just lied, but had cheated.</p><p>Room service charges too high for a man alone. Add a receipt for a silver bangle from Tiffany&#x2019;s&#x2014;which he&#x2019;d never given to her&#x2014;from the same trip, another five thousand at La Perla&#x2014;the lingerie he preferred she wear&#x2014;from another trip, a receipt for a weekend spent in a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont when he&#x2019;d said he was going to finalize a deal in Chicago, and it began to solidify.</p><p>Why had he kept all this, all this proof of his lies and infidelity? Because, she realized, she&#x2019;d trusted him.</p><p>Not even that, she thought, accepting. She&#x2019;d suspected an affair, and he&#x2019;d likely known she had. He kept it because he&#x2019;d thought her too obedient to poke through his personal records.</p><p>And she had been.</p><p>The other lives he&#x2019;d lived, he&#x2019;d locked away. She hadn&#x2019;t known where to find the key, would never have questioned him&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d known it.</p><p>How many other women? she wondered. Did it matter? One was too many, and any of them would have been more sophisticated, more experienced and knowledgeable than the girl from the little mountain town in Tennessee he&#x2019;d knocked up when she was nineteen, dazzled and foolish.</p><p>Why had he married her?</p><p>Maybe he&#x2019;d loved her, at least a little. Wanted her. But she hadn&#x2019;t been enough, not enough to keep him happy, keep him true.</p><p>And did that matter, really? He was dead.</p><p>Yes, she thought. Yes, it mattered.</p><p>He&#x2019;d made a fool of her, left her humiliated. Left her with a financial burden that could hound her for years and jeopardize their daughter&#x2019;s future.</p><p>It damn well mattered.</p><p>She spent another hour going systematically through the office. The safe had already been cleared. She&#x2019;d known about it, though she hadn&#x2019;t had the combination. She&#x2019;d given the lawyers permission to have it opened.</p><p>They&#x2019;d taken most of the legal documents, but there was five thousand in cash. She took it out, set it aside. Callie&#x2019;s birth certificate, their passports.</p><p>She opened Richard&#x2019;s, studied his photo.</p><p>So handsome. Smooth and polished, like a movie star, with his rich brown hair and tawny eyes. She&#x2019;d so wished Callie had inherited his dimples. She&#x2019;d been so charmed by those damn dimples.</p><p>She set the passports aside. However unlikely it was she&#x2019;d use hers or Callie&#x2019;s, she&#x2019;d pack them up. She&#x2019;d destroy Richard&#x2019;s. Or&#x2014;maybe ask the lawyers if that&#x2019;s what she should do.</p><p>She found nothing hidden away, but she&#x2019;d go through everything again before she shredded or filed it all away again in packing boxes.</p><p>Hyped on coffee and grief, she walked through the house, crossed the big two-story foyer, took the curving stairs up, the thick socks she wore soundless on the hardwood.</p><p>She checked on Callie first, went into the pretty room, leaned down to kiss her daughter&#x2019;s cheek before tucking the blankets around her little girl&#x2019;s favored butt-in-the-air sleeping position.</p><p>Leaving the door open, she walked down the hall to the master suite.</p><p>She hated the room, she thought now. Hated the gray walls, the black leather headboard, the sharp lines of the black furniture.</p><p>She hated it more now, knowing she&#x2019;d made love with him in that bed after he&#x2019;d made love with other women, in other beds.</p><p>As her belly twisted she realized she needed to go to the doctor herself. She needed to be sure he hadn&#x2019;t passed anything on to her. Don&#x2019;t think now, she told herself. Just make the appointment tomorrow, and don&#x2019;t think now.</p><p>She went to his closet&#x2014;one nearly as big as the whole of the bedroom she&#x2019;d had back in Rendezvous Ridge, back home.</p><p>Some of the suits had barely been worn, she thought. Armani, Versace, Cucinelli. Richard had leaned toward Italian designers for suits. And shoes, she thought, taking a pair of black Ferragamo loafers off the shoe shelf, turning them over to study the soles.</p><p>Barely scuffed.</p><p>Moving through, she opened a cupboard, took out suit bags.</p><p>She&#x2019;d take as many as she could manage to the consignment shop in the morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Should have done it already,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>But first there&#x2019;d been shock and grief, then the lawyers, the accountants, the government agent.</p><p>She went through the pockets of a gray pinstripe to be certain they were empty, transferred it to the bag. Five a bag, she calculated. Four bags for the suits, then another five&#x2014;maybe six&#x2014;for jackets and coats. Then shirts, casual pants.</p><p>The mindless work kept her calm; the gradual clearing of space lightened her heart, a little.</p><p>She hesitated when she got to the dark bronze leather jacket. He&#x2019;d favored it, had looked so good in the aviator style and the rich color. It was, she knew, one of the few gifts she&#x2019;d given him that he&#x2019;d really liked.</p><p>She stroked one of the sleeves, buttery soft, supple, and nearly gave in to the sentiment to set it aside, keep it, at least for a while.</p><p>Then she thought of the doctor&#x2019;s receipt and dug ruthlessly through the pockets.</p><p>Empty, of course, h...</p></p><h2>Entering the Circle: Ancient Secrets of Siberian Wisdom Discovered by a Russian Psychiatrist</h2><p><p>Olga Kharitidi's debut book is a remarkable account of her spiritual adventure in snowbound Siberia. Joining an ailing friend on a spontaneous trip to the Atai Mountains, Dr. Kharitidi is taken into apprenticeship by a native Shaman who guides her through bizarre, magical, and often terrifying experiences that open her eyes to a wellspring of deeper learning. On the road to Belovedia, a fabled civilization of highly evolved beings, she encounters revolutionary mystical teachings while discovering ancient secrets of magic and healing. At once a modern odyssey and a timeless dreamscape, <em>Entering the Circle</em> is an inspiring story of personal growth and an insightful work about the limitless potential of human spirit.</p></p><p>Olga Kharitidi was born in Siberia, in the former Soviet Union. She has traveled extensively throughout Siberia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, following the ancient wisdom that spread from Siberia to Central Asia, Tibet, and the Himalayas. She is now in the United States, conveying her knowledge of Siberian wisdom and continuing her path of exploration and discovery.The term "shaman" is Russian and, until recently, was applied only to members of the indigenous tribes of Siberia and Central Asia by such scholars as Mircea Eliade. This exciting autobiography cum spiritual adventure by a Soviet psychiatrist is the first popular account of initiation into those tribes' ancient and mysterious traditions. Kharitidi writes (with no translator) in the slightly stilted English of a native Russian-speaker, an effect that highlights the fantastic nature of her encounters. From the grim state hospital where patients are fed only gruel to the isolated Altai Mountains, Kharitidi is inexorably led to Umai, a female shaman who passes her power to Kharitidi on her death and who continues to instruct her from the spirit world. The author's involvement with shamanism is fraught with danger, for in the Soviet Union, interest in the occult can lead to psychiatric commitment. But Kharitidi manages secretly to incorporate her new powers into her practice at the hospital.

She lived through the Civil War and Reconstruction, and eventually owned a cotton farm with her family, all the while relying on her skills with the needle to clothe and feed her children. <br> &nbsp;<br> Later she began making pictorial quilts, using each square to illustrate Bible stories and local legends. She exhibited her quilts at local cotton fairs, and though she never traveled outside of Georgia, her quilts are now priceless examples of African American folk art. <br> &nbsp;<br> Barbara Herkert&#x2019;s lyrical narrative and Vanessa Newton&#x2019;s patchwork illustrations bring this important artist to life in a moving picture-book biography.</p><p>Barbara Herkert has been creating stories since the first grade and is also the author of <i>Mary Cassatt: Extraordinary Impressionist Painter</i>.

As a young girl on a Georgia plantation, she learned how to make cloth, dye it using natural colorings, and make quilts with appliqu� designs stitched on fabric. Powers married and became a wife and mother of five, using her skills as a quilter to help support her family. The story is told in a folksy, conversational tone. Multiple text boxes provide additional information in a clear, direct style, supporting the main text. Upbeat and cheerful, the mixed-media illustrations (a combination of digital art and gouache) present Powers in a positive light and provide details of her daily life. The endpapers feature reproductions of Powers's two existing quilts, and back matter includes an author's note, a photograph of the artist, and an explanation of each of the story quilts. Overall, this is an illuminating introduction to a largely unknown artist. However, teachers and librarians should be aware that there is a considerable amount of fictionalized dialogue: no sources are provided for the quotes from the subject. VERDICT Despite some limitations, this is a much-needed introduction to the life of a little known African American artist, with many possible curriculum connections: artists, quilters, women's history, and the Civil War.&#x2014;Myra Zarnowski, City University of New York</p><h2>Soul of Nowhere</h2><p>Childs answers the call of fierce places; the more desolate the landscape, the more passionately he is drawn to it. For Childs, these are the types of terrain that sharpen the senses, and demand a physicality the modern civilized world no longer requires. Includes black-and-white photos and pen-and-ink drawings by the author.</p><p>Craig Childs--naturalist, adventurer, desert ecologist, and freqent contributor to National Public Radio&#39;s Morning Edition--lives in Crawford, Colorado. His previous books include The Secret Knowledge of Water and Crossing Paths.From the labyrinthine slot canyons of Utah to the deserted island beaches in the Sea of Cortes, the arid lands of the Southwest speak to the acclaimed naturalist Childs. Possessing an extraordinary sense of harmony with these forbidding landscapes, Childs translates their primal voices into a taut and unsentimental narrative of exploration. Step by arduous step, readers follow Childs into the desert's severe mysteries, penetrating deep into regions once home to the cliff dwellers of Salado pre-history and the giants of Seri legend. His intrepid fellow adventurers--a maverick mathematician, a traumatized social worker, a pagan mechanic--mirror Craig's own fierce ardor for stark beauty and fearful silence. Like the ancient ones who inscribed the cliffs with enigmatic spirals, these modern invaders of the dry wilderness probe insatiably into its hidden secrets, fighting their way up sheer cliffs, enduring the unexpected snowstorm, crawling through treacherous mazes. But ultimately all merely human strivings yield to the stark monoliths, the startling waterfalls, and the bleak crevices of a timeless land that embraces and then overshadows all who fall under its spell. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

"Like a Johnny Appleseed with a master's degree, Phillips has gallivanted back and forth across America, to caf�s and coffee shops, senior centers, assisted-living complexes, prisons, libraries, day-care centers, elementary and high schools, and churches, forming lasting communities of inquiry" (<em>Utne Reader</em>). Phillips not only presents the fundamentals of philosophical thought in this "charming, <em>Philosophy for Dummies</em>-type guide" (<em>USA Today</em>); he also recalls what led him to start his itinerant program and re-creates some of the most invigorating sessions, which come to reveal sometimes surprising, often profound reflections on the meaning of love, friendship, work, growing old, and others among Life's Big Questions.</p><p>"How to Start Your Own Socrates Caf�" guide included.</p></p><p>For Christopher Phillips, philosophy is a passion: it is not so much a discipline to be learned as an experience to be lived. Taking his cue from Socrates, the inaugurator of the Western philosophical tradition, Phillips embarks on a search for truth and meaning through a series of conversations that is at once refreshing, humorous, troubling, confusing, encouraging, depressing, and provocative. What makes Plato's Socratic dialogues so enduring--and Phillips's book so intriguing--is that for both Plato and Phillips, philosophy is not something you read or study. It is something you do. Plato wrote in <i>Parmenides</i> that "without wandering around and examining everything in detail one is unable to secure understanding." Phillips takes this approach--the Socratic approach--to heart. In the course of <i>Socrates Caf�</i>, he travels around asking questions of everyone who's interested. Just like the real Socrates, who did not confine himself to the Athenian ivory tower, Phillips searches out public conversations--what he calls Socrates caf�s--with children, seniors, psychiatrists, prisoners, ex-academics, students, lawyers, and everyday people. In a sense, the book is a series of short, modern-day Socratic dialogues interspersed with meditations on the nature of philosophical inquiry. <p> Phillips seizes upon what the Greeks called "elenchus," a method of inquiry that helps people see their own beliefs and opinions more clearly. In the course of the numerous Socrates caf�s highlighted in this book, Phillips persistently reminds us that we ought to ask questions simply because the process is good for us. In each of the caf�s, the participants vary as widely as the questions, and the dialogues are by turns candid, insightful, muddled, intelligent, bland, and piquant. The real meaning of <i>Socrates Caf�</i> lies in the contentious and wonderful space of human interaction. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Christopher Phillips is an educator, author, and pro-democracy activist.

However, the story of manufacturing the airplane itself is usually contained only in the opening chapters of these books. Now, for the first time, here is a major work devoted strictly to telling the story of how this legendary airplane was designed and built using rare original factory photographs, documents, and unique engineering information. The author uses 397 original photos culled from his personal archive of official North American and USAAF images, many of which have never before been seen in any publication whatsoever. This paperback book will provide a vital &#34;missing link&#34; in the saga of this famed World War II aircraft, and is sure to become a valued addition to the libraries of P-51 modelers, historians, enthusiasts, and pilots in both the United States and England.</p><p>Author and photographer Michael O'Leary is well known in the field of aviation journalism, having served for more than 20 years as editor of <i>Air Classics</i> and <i>Warbirds International</i> magazines."Overall this is a great addition to any Mustang library." (Chris Banyai-Riepl <i>Internet Modeler</i> 2012-02-08)<br><br>"Re-released in softbound edition, this book gives a unique manufacturing perspective that makes it a must-buy for die-hard Mustang historians. And the plethora of photographs make it a useful reference for any modeler."

Especially because this same woman, Mary Elizabeth, broke Tucker's heart six years ago by marrying a charismatic Virginia politician, a man who's just been found shot dead.&nbsp;<br><br>Mary Elizabeth needs Tucker's help. Needs him, period. But along with her return comes all the town gossip about their reunion romance. Even his father, who can't manage his own love life, is determined to "impart his wisdom" regarding theirs.&nbsp;<br><br>Tucker's not listening to any of it. He just needs to clear Mary Elizabeth's name. But in the end, he'll confront a mystery even more confusing than murder: how the heart makes room for forgiveness and a new start.</p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Tucker stood in the doorway of his bedroom and wondered why in hell there was a woman in his bed.<br><br>Unless, of course, he was hallucinating. After the kind of day he'd had, that wasn't out of the question. He blinked hard and looked again. Nope, she was still there. Practically buck naked and gorgeous.<br><br>Okay, then, he thought, deeply regretting that he hadn't had one last cup of coffee. He rubbed a hand over his face and tried to get his brain to kick in with the kind of quick thinking for which he was known in law enforcement circles. The woman was a reality. That still didn't give him the first clue about what she was doing in his house and, more specifically, in his bed.<br><br>He certainly hadn't invited her to share that king-size space, not in years, anyway. He hadn't even known she was there until he'd walked in the house, dead tired from working a double shift and ready for bed himself. If he hadn't flipped on the bedroom lights, he might have crawled in beside her, which wouldn't have been altogether a bad thing under other circumstances.<br><br>As it was, he was simply standing here, mouth gaping as if he'd never seen a half-naked woman before... especially this particular woman.<br><br>Last he'd heard, Mary Elizabeth Swan had wanted nothing further to do with him. In fact, the last he'd read on the front page of the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch, </em>she was marrying the local delegate to the Virginia house of delegates. Though that was far from the last occasion on which her name had appeared in print, it was the last time Tucker had permitted himself to read any article that mentioned her. He had to skip quite a bit in the local weekly&#x2014;to say nothing of entire pages in the feature section of the Richmond paper when the house of delegates was in session.<br><br>It sometimes seemed to him as if Liz, as she preferred to be called these days, was on the board of every cultural institution in the entire state. Her picture&#x2014;always taken at some fancy shindig requiring designer clothes&#x2014;leapt out at him at least once a week, reminding him with heart-stopping clarity of just how susceptible he was to any glimpse of that flawless face and tawny mane of hair.<br><br>Of course, he sometimes had a hard time reconciling those sophisticated images with the girl he'd fallen for on a schoolyard playground the day she'd pummeled a nine-year-old boy for trying to sneak a peek at her panties while she'd been scrambling up a tree. Mary Elizabeth had been a tomboy back then, and while she'd eventually outgrown tree climbing, she'd never outgrown her go-for-broke enthusiasm for life. Not while she'd been with him, at any rate. She'd looked depressingly sedate in those newspaper pictures, however, so maybe she'd changed now that she was going on thirty and a force to be reckoned with in Richmond society.<br><br>Tucker had finally taken to tossing the feature section aside just to avoid the temptation to sit and stare and brood about what might have been... what <em>should </em>have been. What kind of pitiful excuse for a man couldn't get a woman out of his system after six years and a steady diet of gushing reports about the wildly successful man she'd chosen over him?<br><br>Lawrence Chandler had high-tech millions and political ambitions. Mary Elizabeth, who'd been born right here in Westmoreland County, came from generations of Virginia blue blood. She'd inherited Swan Ridge, her grandfather's estate overlooking the Potomac. A cynic might have wondered if that stately old house with its manicured lawn and sweeping views hadn't been as much a lure for Chandler as Mary Elizabeth herself. New money seeking old respectability, as it were.<br><br>Be that as it may, it was a marriage made in political heaven. If Tucker had heard that once, he'd heard it a hundred times, usually right before people realized they were saying it to the prior man in Mary Elizabeth's life, the one who'd loved her since childhood, the one who'd expected to marry her. Then they'd slink away, looking embarrassed or&#x2014;even worse&#x2014;pitying.<br><br>According to all those same reports, Chandler intended to be governor by forty, bypass Congress and head straight for the White House by fifty. Not one single political pundit seemed to doubt him.<br><br>But he wasn't likely to pull that off, Tucker concluded, if people discovered that his wife was sleeping just about bare-assed in the bed of a small-town sheriff who had once been her lover.<br><br>Tucker might have gloated over this turn of events, but he'd been a sheriff a long time now. Things were seldom what they seemed. He doubted Mary Elizabeth had come crawling back because she realized she'd made a terrible mistake six years ago and wanted to rectify it tonight.<br><br>Nope, one glimpse at her pale complexion, at what looked like dried tears on her cheeks and the dark smudges under her eyes, and he concluded that she was here because there was some kind of trouble and for some reason she was desperate enough to turn to him. The thought of the strong woman he'd once known being vulnerable and needy shook him as much as her unexpected presence.<br><br>He needed to think about this, and he couldn't do it in the same room with a woman who'd once made his blood roar just by glancing at him with her stunning violet eyes. Mary Elizabeth in a tangle of sheets with only one of his T-shirts barely covering her pretty much rendered him incoherent. She always had, and judging from the way his body was reacting right now that hadn't changed.<br><br>Tucker retreated to the kitchen and poured himself a stiff drink, thought about it and made it a double. He had a feeling he was going to need it before the night was over.<br><br>Liz stretched, then froze as a barrage of ugly memories crashed over her. For one instant, for one brief moment, she'd forgotten everything that had happened the night before. She'd forgotten the discovery that had brought her running to a man she'd abandoned years ago, the only person on earth she could trust to help her.<br><br>If he would.<br><br>He had to, she told herself staunchly. Tucker was not the kind of man to turn his back on someone in trouble, even someone he hadn't spoken to in years, someone who'd hurt him. Tucker was the most honorable man she'd ever known. She was counting on that mile-wide streak of Spencer integrity to come through for her, even if she didn't deserve it.<br><br>She hadn't expected to sleep at all when she'd gotten here. In fact, she'd expected to spend endless hours answering questions, but with no sign of Tucker on the premises, she'd been left all alone in the dark with her nerves rattled and her thoughts scrambling. She'd waited for a while on the porch, but eventually exhaustion and fear had taken their toll. She had gone inside the unlocked house&#x2014;a testament to Tucker's faith in his own law-enforcement skills&#x2014;in search of a much-needed shower to cleanse away all signs of the night's events.<br><br>Then she'd found one of his T-shirts tossed over the back of a chair, slipped it on and, like a child seeking the safety of a familiar place, had crawled into Tucker's bed to wait for him, uncertain what shift he was working or even whether he would be home at all. For all she knew, he could be spending his nights in another woman's arms.<br><br>Now, judging from the soft gray light spilling in the windows, she'd slept through the night. Alone, which was as it should be.<br><br>Some sixth sense told her that she might be alone in Tucker's bed, but she was not by herself. She rolled over and looked straight into eyes that were as familiar to her as her husband's. More familiar, in some ways.<br><br>Tucker regarded her with a cool, penetrating gaze that seemed to see straight into her soul. She wondered if he could see the turmoil, if he could read just how terrified she was... how relieved that he was finally there, even if his expression was far from friendly.<br><br>"Welcome back seems a little inappropriate," Tucker said with the wry humor that Liz had once decried because it kept her at a distance.<br><br>She studied his face, noted the new lines fanning away from the corners of his crystal-blue eyes, the furrow in his forehead that meant he'd spent most of the night thinking hard about how to cope with her unexpected presence. She wanted to touch him, wanted to smooth away that furrow and tell him not to worry, but that was out of the question. He had every reason to worry. She was about to draw him into a quagmire.<br><br>Not only was she&#x2014;the woman who had once dumped him&#x2014;suddenly back in his bed, but she was in more trouble than even Tucker Spencer with his keen intelligence, sterling moral streak and investigative skills was likely to be able to fix. But, God help her, she needed him to try... for both their sakes.<br><br>"Why are you here?" he asked, when she said nothing.<br><br>Liz wished she had the kind of simple answer he seemed to expect. "It's complicated," she began finally.<br><br>"Not good enough," Tucker said flatly.<br><br>His inscrutable gaze never once left her face, not even to stray to the ample amount of bare skin revealed by his twisted, hiked-up T-shirt. She shivered at the sudden chill in the air and drew the sheet tightly around her, embarrassed by her indecent exposure. Once it wouldn't have mattered, but now it did. Things between them had changed. Much as she might hate it, it was an undeniable fact.<br><br>She had to fight to blink back the tears that threatened. She wouldn't&#x2014;she couldn't&#x2014;cry. If she started, she might never stop. She had made such a mess of things&#x2014;of her relationship with Tucker, of her marriage, of her life. Right now, though, she had to concentrate on one thing... finding out what had happened last night and who was responsible.<br><br>"Still have that rigid self-control, I see," she said, covering her nerves with sarcasm, even at the risk of alienating the only friend she was likely to have in Trinity Harbor, where people might have voted for her husband but had been slow to forgive her for the choice she'd made between Tucker and an outsider.<br><br>"It's gotten me through the rough spots," he replied evenly.<br><br>"Meaning what I did to you," she said, regretting that they hadn't had this particular conversation years ago and gotten it out of the way. But Tucker, stoic and disdainful, had refused to let her explain anything back then. He'd said it was enough that she was turning her back on everything they'd shared. He hadn't wanted to know the details, hadn't wanted to understand her reasons for choosing Larry over him. Maybe he'd been right. Maybe none of them were good enough to make what she'd done forgivable. Maybe he hadn't needed to know how deeply she regretted having hurt him.<br><br>In the years since, even though they lived within miles of each other for part of the year, she'd done her best to stay out of his path. She'd figured she owed him that much. And if she hadn't come to that conclusion on her own, King Spencer had made it a point to remind her every time they'd crossed paths. She'd made a powerful enemy there, no doubt about it.<br><br>"Is our breakup the rough spot you're talking about?" she asked.<br><br>"That was one thing," he agreed.<br><br>It saddened her that there might have been more, that he'd suffered losses, endured crises, she'd known nothing about. "And the others?"<br><br>"Liz, you're not here to catch up on old times," Tucker said with a hint of impatience. "Why <em>are </em>you here, instead of over at Swan Ridge? Where the hell are your clothes? What kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into, and last&#x2014;but hardly least&#x2014;why aren't you turning to your husband for help?"<br><br>She shivered again at the cold glint in his eyes and wondered if she'd made a dreadful mistake in coming here. Tucker was, after all, the sheriff. His first obligation would be to the law, not to her. But instinct had brought her to Tucker, and desperation would keep her from leaving. She needed help that he could pro vide...if he would. It all came down to that.<br><br>"I'm afraid Larry can't help me with this one," she told him.<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>She risked a look into those hard, unyielding eyes, praying that Tucker would forgive her for the past, praying even harder that he would help her despite it.<br><br>"Because he's dead," she said, then added before she could lose her nerve, "and everyone's going to think I killed him."<br><br>Well, hell, Tucker thought, as Mary Elizabeth's explanation hit him in the gut. He should have known she wasn't here to rekindle an old flame. He <em>had </em>known it. A part of him just hadn't wanted to believe it. A part of him, overcome with that same old uncontrollable lust, hadn't given two figs why she was back. He was going to have to try really, really hard to ignore that part of him, at least until he knew what the devil was going on.<br><br>If Chandler was dead, why hadn't he heard about it? Surely it would have been big news. She couldn't possibly be telling him it had just happened, could she?<br><br>"When did he die?" he asked, trying to ignore the fact that tears were welling up in her eyes and that she was doing her best to keep them from spilling down her cheeks. Mary Elizabeth had always hated to let anyone see her cry, especially him.<br><br>"Sometime yesterday, I think. I'm not sure." He stared at her incredulously. "You don't know?" "I went to Swan Ridge last night about eleven," she began.<br><br>The news just got worse and worse, Tucker concluded.<br><br>"Am I hearing you right? It happened here, in Trinity Harbor?" he demanded as the ramifications of that slammed into him. He had a dead politician in his jurisdiction and no one knew about it. Dear God, what <em>had </em>Mary Elizabeth been thinking?<br><br>She nodded at his harsh question. "Yes. I..." She swallowed hard. "I found him. And then I came here."<br><br>"Damn it, Mary Elizabeth, have you lost your mind?" Tucker exploded before he could stop himself.<br><br>Now the tears were more than she could fight. A steady torrent of them streamed down her cheeks, and Tucker's heart flipped over. He fought the reaction and stayed right where he was.<br><br>"I didn't know where else to go, what else to do," she whispered.<br><br>She sounded more frightened and helpless than she'd ever sounded in her life, at least around him. Bravado had been ingrained in her from the day she'd arrived to live with her grandfather, a little girl who'd just lost her parents and been left with a man who was a virtual stranger.<br><br></p><h2>Otis and the Kittens</h2><p><b><b>The #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling artist Loren Long, presents </b><b><i>Otis and the Kittens</i></b><b>, a story of friendship and unlikely heroes, now in board book format!</b></b><br><br>On the farm, it hasn't rained in a long time.

But there is one very bad thing. It's hard to find a job if you're out of work. All that a king can do is rule, and if you have no kingdom then you are out of work. <br>That's what happened to young King Zar. He was a good king, but young and without much experience. A bold, strong king with many soliders had attacked his kingdom. <br>Young Zar found himself with no country, with no palace or house or hut. Zar had twelve gold pieces, a suit of clothes and a sword. So he set out to find work. <br>The road was long and the world was wide. In Zar's search for a kingdom he met six unusual friends along the way. From the author of the Danny Dunn books, magically illustrated by Imero Gobbato.

Her joints were swollen and painful, and she could barely walk. Her knuckles and fingers were so inflamed that she couldn&#x2019;t even hold her husband&#x2019;s hand. She could not accept that she&#x2019;d have to live this way for the rest of her life. After years of searching, she finally found doctors who taught her that your diet and lifestyle can dramatically affect autoimmune disease. Jill has now been free of lupus symptoms for over 17 years. After years of being pain free, she wrote this book to share her story with others. She also includes the stories of 11 other people who, after similar diet changes, also got dramatic results with their lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.

ATHENA SLID INTO her seat in her Beast-ology class at Mount Olympus Academy just as the lyrebell for second period rang. She pushed her long wavy brown hair back as she pulled her textscroll for the class from her bag.<br> <br>Right away her dragon-headed teacher, Professor Ladon, held up a rolled sheet of papyrus. &#x201c;An interesssting letterssscroll hasss arrived, which I will now read aloud sssince it concernsss sssome of you,&#x201d; he announced to the class. Licks of flame flew from his lips as he spoke, setting the edge of the letterscroll on fire.<br> <br>&#x201c;Godnesss!&#x201d; he exclaimed. The teacher&#x2019;s eyes bugged, and he began shaking the letterscroll with one clawed green hand in an attempt to put out the flames.<br> <br>Poseidon, a handsome godboy with pale turquoise skin and eyes, jumped from his seat in the front row. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Professor Ladon. I&#x2019;m on it!&#x201d; he called. He grasped the long handle of the trident he always carried and extended its drippy three-pronged end toward the letterscroll. As drops of water sprayed from the trident&#x2019;s prongs onto the papyrus, the flames quickly fizzled out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanksss,&#x201d; hissed Professor Ladon. He smiled, baring huge, sharp dragon teeth.<br> <br>Athena&#x2019;s blue-gray eyes widened, and she drew back a little. The sight of those teeth never failed to startle her.<br> <br>But Poseidon grinned back at the teacher, unfazed. &#x201c;No problemo.&#x201d; As godboy of the sea, he was all about water. He loved tinkering with the fountains here at MOA, and had designed a magnificent water park with polished marble slides, gleaming fountains, and pools of turquoise water down on Earth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Asss I wasss about to sssay,&#x201d; the teacher continued, wisely holding the papyrus scroll farther away from his long flame-spewing dragon snout this time. &#x201c;I will now read the letterssscroll.<br> <br>&#x201c;DEAR PROFESSSOR LADON,<br> <br>I AM WRITING TO INVITE FOURTEEN<br> <br>SSSTUDENTS TO BE GUESTSSS AT<br> <br>THE GRAND OPENING OF MY NEW<br> <br>AMUSSSEMENT PARK.<br> <br>WHEN: THISSS SSSATURDAY.<br> <br>WHO: PLEASSSE SSSELECT SSSEVEN<br> <br>BOYSSS AND SSSEVEN GIRLSSS, A MIX<br> <br>OF GODDESSSGIRLSSS, GODBOYSSS, AND<br> <br>MORTALSSS.

A MAP ISSS<br> <br>ATTACHED.<br> <br>YOURSSS TRULY,<br> <br>KING MINOSSS<br> <br>P.SSS. NO WEAPONSSS ALLOWED.&#x201d;<br> <br>Murmurs of excitement rose from the class. Athena leaned over and whispered to Persephone, the pale-skinned, red-haired goddessgirl who sat next to her and was one of her three best friends. &#x201c;Did you catch that article about Minos&#x2019;s new amusement park in yesterday&#x2019;s Greekly Weekly News ?&#x201d;<br> <br>Persephone nodded. &#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It sounds really a-maze-ing.&#x201d; Both girls giggled at her little joke.<br> <br>The king had officially named his park Minos&#x2019;s aMAZEment Park because its central attraction was a cavelike labyrinth. Which was basically a simple maze with numerous passages that ran beneath the king&#x2019;s palace.<br> <br>The park had been designed and built by Daedalus. He was the most famous mortal inventor and architect on Earth, yet he was only sixteen years old! As the goddessgirl of crafts, among other things, Athena was a keen inventor herself. In fact, one of her inventions&#x2014;the olive&#x2014;had proved so useful to some mortals in Greece that they&#x2019;d named their city Athens after her. In a contest at MOA earlier that year, her olive had even beat out the water park Poseidon had invented.<br> <br>&#x201c;So which of us get to go?&#x201d; asked a dark-haired, dark-eyed godboy named Apollo.<br> <br>Good question, thought Athena. She caught Persephone&#x2019;s eye again and crossed her fingers. Persephone crossed hers back. Because who wouldn&#x2019;t want a chance to preview a fabulous new funpark?<br> <br>Before Professor Ladon could answer the question, a godboy with a lizardlike tail turned to grin at Apollo. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you already know who&#x2019;s going, Mr. Godboy of Prophecy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone laughed, including Apollo. It was true he was the godboy of prophecy, but apparently he hadn&#x2019;t foreseen the king&#x2019;s invitation. Or the names of the students who&#x2019;d be going.<br> <br>&#x201c;To anssswer Apollo&#x2019;sss query,&#x201d; Professor Ladon replied at last, &#x201c;I think it fair that I sssend only the top ssstudentsss from all of my classsesss to the park asss a reward for achievement.&#x201d;<br> <br>The students closest to him inched their hands up to cover their noses and mouths as he spoke. Professor Ladon had the worst dragon breath of any teacher at MOA!<br> <br>Without seeming to notice, the teacher went on. &#x201c;Ssso anyone who hasss achieved the tenth Level of the Arrow may volunteer to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Persephone pumped her arm. &#x201c;That means we&#x2019;re in! So are Aphrodite and Artemisss!&#x201d; she whispered to Athena excitedly. Then she giggled. &#x201c;Oops! Sorry. I guess the teacher&#x2019;s habit of hissing his Ss is catching.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yesss!&#x201d; Athena agreed, giggling too.<br> <br>However, Poseidon groaned. He and several other students who hadn&#x2019;t yet achieved the tenth level slumped in their seats at the teacher&#x2019;s news. Athena felt kind of sorry for them. But they&#x2019;d be able to visit Minos&#x2019;s aMAZEment Park another time, since it would be open for years to come.<br> <br>She and her three goddessgirl best friends had recently made it to the tenth level after an epic battle. They&#x2019;d defeated a dozen monsters&#x2014;tough opponents with sharp teeth and claws, and breath even more horrific than Professor Ladon&#x2019;s! Of course, the monsters hadn&#x2019;t been real beasts, only magical game projections created by the professor to challenge them in the Forest of the Beasts down on Earth.<br> <br>The forest was where the goddessgirls had fought the monsters to win the tenth level. The place where all students from Professor Ladon&#x2019;s classes practiced their hunting skills on the first Friday of every month. The rest of the time classes were held here at MOA in this very classroom.<br> <br>Persephone turned to look back at Hades, godboy of the Underworld. He flashed her a smile. The two of them had been crushing on each other since forever. Looking at Professor Ladon, Hades asked, &#x201c;When do we leave?&#x201d; He and several of his godboy friends, including Apollo, had also reached the tenth level recently.<br> <br>&#x201c;After ssschool on Friday. We&#x2019;ll ssspend all day Sssaturday at the park, and return Sssaturday evening,&#x201d; Professor Ladon replied.<br> <br>Then he explained how the invitation had come about. Apparently, Daedalus had been impressed with the Forest of the Beasts when Professor Ladon had showed it to him nearly a year ago. In fact, after studying the magical beasts the professor had created, Daedalus had been inspired to design a mechanical version of the Minotaur, one of the most terrifying of the forest beasts. It would inhabit King Minos&#x2019;s new labyrinth.<br> <br>&#x201c;To thank me for providing inssspiration for his mechanical Minotaur, Daedalusss convinced King Minosss to invite ssstudents from my classsses to the opening of the park,&#x201d; Professor Ladon said in conclusion.<br> <br>A shiver ran down Athena&#x2019;s back as she thought about the Minotaur. There were actually three of them in the Forest, and each was huge and bull-like, standing upright however, with horns, clawed hands, hooves, and a gold ring in its snorting nose. Terrifying, indeed!<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t have time to dwell on the matter of the Minotaur. Because the class moved on to studying the languages of the beasts, until the lyrebell rang.<br> <br>Out in the hall after class ended, Athena, Persephone, Apollo, and Hades all high-fived one another. &#x201c;This trip is going to be so fun,&#x201d; said Persephone.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be awesome!&#x201d; Apollo enthused. &#x201c;Just think&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll be the first ones ever to try the rides.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boys took off for their next classes still buzzing about the park, but the two girls waited outside the classroom until Aphrodite and Artemis showed up for third-period Beast-ology.<br> <br>After Athena and Persephone shared the good news about the upcoming trip, the four girls grabbed each other in a group hug, jumping up and down in excitement.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can hardly believe I get to hang out with my GGBFFs at a funpark this weekend instead of doing homework,&#x201d; said Athena.<br> <br>Artemis, Persephone, and Aphrodite looked at her in confusion. &#x201c;GGBFF?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goddessgirl best friends forever,&#x201d; explained Athena. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so excited that I just made it up by accident!&#x201d;<br> <br>Her friends giggled. &#x201c;So who else will be going? Do we know?&#x201d; Aphrodite asked, running a hand through her long, golden hair. It was threaded with pink ribbons that matched the sparkly pink chiton she was wearing. As befitted the goddessgirl of love and beauty, she was breathtakingly beautiful. Several boys passing by turned their heads to glance at her adoringly before continuing on to their classes. But to her credit Aphrodite hardly noticed. She might be beautiful, but she wasn&#x2019;t stuck-up about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Apollo will be,&#x201d; Artemis informed them. She shifted the bow and quiver of arrows slung over her shoulder, which she rarely went anywhere without. Her dark hair was done up in its usual cute twist and secured with a gold band, and she smoothed a curl back into the twist as she continued on. &#x201c;He and Actaeon just earned their tenth Level of the Arrow last week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How lucky that they&#x2019;ll both be able to come,&#x201d; Athena replied. Apollo was Artemis&#x2019;s twin brother, and Actaeon was Artemis&#x2019;s crush. &#x201c;Heracles will get to go too. And Pandora.&#x201d; Heracles was Athena&#x2019;s crush, and Pandora was her roommate in the girls&#x2019; dorm on the fourth floor of MOA. So she knew that both had achieved the tenth level.<br> <br>Maybe Heracles and I can sit together on the ride over, Athena thought with pleasure. Two weeks ago, they&#x2019;d worked with other students to build a fabulous carousel inside the Immortal Marketplace&#x2014;a mall halfway between MOA and Earth. Since then she&#x2019;d gotten so busy with homework, Cheer, and other projects that she&#x2019;d hardly spent any time with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ares is tenth level,&#x201d; said Aphrodite, mentioning her crush. &#x201c;I think Medusa and Dionysus are too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm. Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; said Artemis. She counted on her fingers. &#x201c;That makes the four of us, on the girls&#x2019; side, plus Medusa and Pandora. And Apollo, Ares, Actaeon, Hades, Heracles, and Dionysus on the boys&#x2019; side. Six and six.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;re missing one girl and one boy to make up the group of fourteen that Minos invited in that letterscroll, right?&#x201d; asked Persephone.<br> <br>The lyrebell began to ping, signaling that third period was about to begin. &#x201c;Yikes, better get going,&#x201d; said Aphrodite. While nudging Artemis into the classroom, she sent Athena and Persephone a little wave good-bye.<br> <br>Athena waved back and nodded to Persephone. &#x201c;Right. Good math,&#x201d; she said in answer to her friend&#x2019;s question. &#x201c;According to the Greekly Weekly News the funpark is huge. King Minos could have invited the whole school! But I suppose he must be thinking it&#x2019;s best to try out the rides with a small group first. Before the park opens to the public.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the two girls separated and began to move in different directions toward their next classes, Persephone called back over her shoulder. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re lucky we&#x2019;re part of the group that gets to go. I can&#x2019;t wait for this weekend!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me either,&#x201d; Athena called back. It wasn&#x2019;t every day that they got an exclusive invitation to the park that mortals and immortals everywhere were talking about. Everyone had been counting the days till it opened.<br> <br>She still hadn&#x2019;t heard who the seventh girl and seventh boy were by the end of the school day when she climbed the marble staircase to the girls&#x2019; dorm. Pandora was sitting at her desk working but immediately turned to greet Athena when she entered the room they shared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi. Isn&#x2019;t the news about the park trip mega-awesome? What should we pack? Do you have much homework?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not that much,&#x201d; said Athena, answering only one of her questions. That was usually enough to satisfy Pandora. Besides, the two girls would wind up talking all night if Athena tried to answer all of her mortal roommate&#x2019;s questions. She liked Pandora, but sometimes it was hard to get any real work done when she was around. That girl was so curious about everything and asked so many questions that her bangs were shaped like question marks!<br> <br>Athena put her stuff away and settled at her desk, which was near the window, beyond her bed and wardrobe. On the opposite side of the room were Pandora&#x2019;s identical bed, wardrobe, and desk.<br> <br>Inspired by the thought that she might get to meet Daedalus in a few days, Athena opened a drawer and pulled out a sheaf of papyrus. The she picked up her favorite ink-filled blue-feather quill pen and tapped it against her chin, thinking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Need some help?&#x201d; Pandora asked eagerly. Quiet drove her crazy.<br> <br>Athena looked over at her, unsure. &#x201c;Yeah, I do, actually,&#x201d; she said after a few seconds. &#x201c;In your opinion what&#x2019;s the least successful or least exciting thing I&#x2019;ve ever invented?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The plow?&#x201d; Pandora answered without hesitation.<br> <br>Athena stared at her in surprise. &#x201c;Really? But it&#x2019;s so useful.&#x201d; A tool she&#x2019;d created to help farmers, its iron blade could break up the soil and cut furrows in the ground, into which seed could later be sown to grow crops.<br> <br>Pandora cocked her head and wrinkled her nose a little. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s kind of heavy and awkward, though? I overheard some farmers down on Earth complaining that it takes two people to operate it&#x2014;one to push on the wooden handle from behind and another person harnessed in front to pull. Don&#x2019;t take this the wrong way, but compared to your olive, and inventions like the ship, chariot, flute, and trumpet, that plow is kind of dull. And boring, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Awkward, dull, and boring? Gosh, tell me what you really think, roomie,&#x201d; Athena teased. She adored inventing new things, worked hard to perfect them, and was proud of each and every one of her inventions, big or small. So Pandora&#x2019;s criticisms stung. But then, Athena had asked for feedback.<br> <br>She grinned, softening her words. &#x201c;You make good points, though. Come to think of it, I have heard grumbling about that plow now and then.&#x201d; She had received plenty of praise for her other inventions&#x2014;though, to be fair, she could understand why people would think using a plow was hot, sweaty, hard, and awkward work.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for being honest,&#x201d; Athena said, letting go of her hurt feelings. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been a big help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; said Pandora.<br> <br>To Athena&#x2019;s relief her roomie soon announced that she was leaving for a while to hang out with Medusa, a snake-haired, green-skinned mortal MOA student. Now Athena could get some real work done! After her roommate left, Athena began to sketch new design ideas for improving what Pandora&#x2014;and farmers, apparently, too&#x2014;considered her most hard-to-use and boring invention. The plow.<br> <br>But how could she improve it? Would a sharper blade help? More comfortable handles for pushing? Wheels? She sketched out each idea as it came to her, but just as quickly rejected those ideas, tossing her sketches over her shoulder until they littered the floor.<br> <br>As she continued drawing, her frustration grew. Nothing she came up with seemed like it would improve her current design enough to make a difference in the ease of her invention&#x2019;s use. She was stumped. Fresh out of good ideas.<br> <br>When a knock came at her door, she called out distractedly, &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?

Too many initiatives for reconciliation, fail to remove the weeds of injustice at the roots, and thus stop short of completing the work required. Such political arrangements usually favor the rich and powerful, but deprive the powerless of justice and dignity. This is a form of political pietism, and when Christians refuse to name this situation for what it is, they are practicing Christian quietism. True reconciliation is radical. <br><br>In this book the authors a South African prominent in the struggle against apartheid, and a white U.S. theologian who has served in pastoral roles in multi-racial congregations offer a vision of reconciliation and social justice grounded in the biblical story and their own experience of activism. After re-examining the meaning of reconciliation in the biblical context, the authors examine Jesus role as a radical reconciler and prophet of social justice. They go on to examine the role of reconciliation in religious communities and in the wider society.</p><p>Allan Aubrey Boesak was a leading figure in the church struggle against apartheid in South Africa.

Ten, sometimes twelve a night, shoving them in my pockets, hiding them up my sleeves, smuggling them out of bars and diners and anywhere else I could find them. In the morning, wherever I woke up, I was always covered in salt. I was cured meat. I had become beef jerky. Even as a small, small child, I knew it would one day come to this.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That Sunday I could feel my head pounding even before I opened my eyes. I might have kept them shut all day if there hadn't been two men standing over my bed.<br>&nbsp;<br>"All right partyboy, time to get up," one of them said in a gruff, weary voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>I blinked a few times. I was very confused. I didn't know who either of them were, or what the fuck they were doing in my apartment. They both had their shirts tucked in and the older one, the one with the gruff voice, had a low hairline that started just above his eyebrows and a drooping mustache that hung along his sagging jowls. He looked like a walrus. The younger one had slicked-back hair and squared shoulders and perfect posture. He was smirking like he couldn't wait to show me how cocky he was. He looked like every cop that had ever given me a ticket.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Smells like criminal intent in here," he said, glaring at me.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What?" I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I was gonna ask you the same thing," he said, challenging me in a way that I did not understand.<br>&nbsp;<br>The older guy looked annoyed at both of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm Detective Brooks," he said, "and this is Detective Sikes. We're here to ask you a few questions."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Don't you need a warrant or something? How did you get in here?" I couldn't think of anything I'd done that would get me arrested. If stealing a few saltshakers was wrong I didn't want to be right.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your door was wide open so we came in, just to make sure you were okay. And we don't need a warrant to ask you a couple of questions. We just want to talk."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh." I had my bedsheet pulled up to my chin and I was clenching it with both fists for some reason. It must have been the goddamn vampires again.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why don't you sit up like a big boy and talk to us," Sikes said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No thanks, I'm very comfortable."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Where are your manners," he said, smirking. "Rise and shine fancy pants!" and he grabbed the bottom of my sheet and yanked it away from me like my father used to do with my blanky when I was very small, but this time I didn't cry. And I knew that I was finally a man.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was still wearing my shoes and the same clothes I'd been fired in on Friday, except now everything was covered in salt. There was a pile of it on my bed, and I was buried underneath it like the sleeping dad on the beach who wakes up to find that his mischievous asshole children have played a joke on him with their buckets of sand and their cruelty. But these men were not my children, and there were no saltshakers anywhere. Where had it all come from? How had this happened? I had no idea. I have never been able to explain myself.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Bling bling. Looks like somebody had themselves a little fiesta," Sikes said. "What've we got here, coke? H? Mexican chimmy hat?" He stuck his pinky into his mouth and then dipped it in the salt. "You're going away for a long time se�or," he said as he jammed his salt-speckled finger up his nostril.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sergeant that doesn't look like--" Brooks started to say, but Sikes was already snorting. His eyes watered and he started coughing and sneezing in short fast fits like a dog. He blew his nose into his hands and rushed to the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. The faucet was on for a long time and he was coughing and spitting and crying.<br>&nbsp;<br>Brooks looked at me strange.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You sleep in salt?" he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sometimes."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Good for your back?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's all right."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You famous or something?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Not really," I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>He considered the possibilities, then decided I was guilty of some undetermined perversion and shook his head. We both listened as Detective Sikes heaved into my sink. I wished the guy in the apartment above me would start fucking his guinea pig again, just to give us something else to listen to, but he did not. Those kinds of wishes almost never come true.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the cocky prick finally came out of the bathroom his face was raw and smeared, his eyes puffy from all the crying. He looked like a burn victim, one who'd been through numerous successful surgeries but still wasn't fully healed. It's tough to ever really recover after your face has been on fire. I stared at him pretty fucking bemused but he wouldn't look at me.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Now that you've cracked the case," I said, smiling at Sikes and his chafed red nose, "I really would like to get back to sleep. I bid you both good morning."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's two in the afternoon," Brooks said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No shit."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Like I said, we have a few questions for you."<br>&nbsp;<br>"All right," I said, and sighed.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was still foggy and my head was throbbing, but I could play vice squad with these two for a few minutes. It would make them feel like they were being useful, and it would be an interesting start to my day. I just hoped I hadn't done anything stupid the night before. I didn't remember anything illegal. I didn't remember anything really.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Where were you last night, around 10 p.m.?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Probably at a bar."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Probably?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Probably."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What bar?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"The one down the street."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What's the name of it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What's this about?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"How well do you know Marlene Burton?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Who?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"The assistant at Dr. Weinhardt's office. Your dentist."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, deaf Marlene."<br>&nbsp;<br>"She had a last name." Sikes broke his shame-induced silence. "She wasn't defined by her disability. She was a person too you know."<br>&nbsp;<br>I know, fuckhead, I signed in response, working my hands slow for emphasis. I waited for him to react. I wanted to slap away the cockiness that was already creeping back into his blotchy, running face. When it was clear that he had no idea I'd called him a fuckhead in sign language I said, "What about her?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Marlene Burton was found dead last night."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>My dentist's name was Dr. Weinhardt but I called him Doug. Doug had episodes. He'd flip out and have to lie down and monitor his pulse and breathe slow and in rhythm like a pregnant woman or else he'd faint, which he usually did anyway. He thought iced tea helped, so he kept a pitcher of it in his back office on a table beside his fainting couch, and he carried a monogrammed flask with him wherever he went. The monogram was D.W.I. Douglas Weinhardt the First.<br>&nbsp;<br>"But D.W.I. are the initials for Driving While Intoxicated! And it's a flask but there's no alcohol, it's only iced tea. Get it? And I don't even drive! I take the bus every day! That's funny, right?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Jesus Doug."<br>&nbsp;<br>He thought his episodes were being caused by a series of brutal attacks he'd suffered recently. This is how he explained it to me:<br>&nbsp;<br>"About three months ago I was getting off a bus downtown when all of a sudden--Psshew!" He smacked both his hands against his ears. "The big folding accordion door closed right on my head! And then there must have been a malfunction or something because it just went Wham! Wham! Wham!" He pressed the air around both sides of his head three times fast with his palms, spreading his fingers and holding his elbows high, like some New Wave dance that was so embarrassing no one even joked about it anymore. "It kept slamming into my head until I fell out into the street. When I woke up there was a crowd of people standing around me and a man was snapping his fingers in my face. The bus driver said he'd never seen anything like it. I couldn't stand up without falling down again. I had to ride home in the back of an ambulance. And then a few weeks later, on a different bus with a different driver, it happened again! It's happened six more times since. I don't even call the ambulance anymore. I just crawl around until my equilibrium comes back."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Christ Doug. Maybe you should see a doctor."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I am a doctor," he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>It would have sounded smug if he hadn't just finished telling a story about getting his head jackhammered by a bus door. It's real hard to come off as even slightly superior when you're living a Tom and Jerry episode.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Doug had a dental assistant named Marlene. My first appointment I was reclined in the chair and Doug was gouging my teeth and gums with something he called the sharpo. "Just cleaning the plaque out of the gutters," he said as blood drained into the back of my throat.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a bright light hovering above me like the ones aliens and angels use to trick people into not running away and I was breathing hard through my nose and panicking because I was choking to death on my own blood. Then I heard someone else come into the room, their shoes softly padding the floor. The light steps sounded like a woman's.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh there she is. Just in time. Can you hand me the pro-ber?" Doug said.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was speaking very slowly and louder than a normal person should. A woman's hand passed between me and the light. I saw red nails, and I was very impressed with myself. I had always been perceptive. I could've been a detective. I could've been blind and still been able to solve crimes and mysteries. I was almost like a superhero sometimes. <br>&nbsp;<br>"No no, the pr-o-ber," he said way too deliberately, adding an unnecessary syllable. I figured she was either six years old or retarded. If she was that young she shouldn't be wearing nail polish. And if she was retarded she'd better not be allowed to play with the drills.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thank you. Now can I get some suc-tion? Suc-tion?"<br>&nbsp;<br>She put the thin vacuum tube in my mouth and it sucked and slurped the blood from the back of my throat as Doug kept hacking away. I could breathe again. This woman had saved my life. I would probably marry her, even if she was six years old and retarded. We would have a strange life together.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh gosh, you two haven't even met! If someone's putting their hands in your mouth you should at least know their name," Doug said. "Shane, this is my assistant, Marlene."<br>&nbsp;<br>A head leaned over close to me, eclipsing the tricky, paranormal light. There was a serene halo of blond hair lit up all around her face. Single strands hung down like icicles. It was beautiful.<br>&nbsp;<br>"HI NICE TO MEET YOU!" she shouted atonally into my gaping mouth.<br>&nbsp;<br>I saw this documentary once that had black and white footage of a man in goggles and baggy clothes. He looked vaguely German, or like someone the Germans would've taken prisoner back when everything was black and white. He was pale and skinny and his head was shaved bald. His legs were in stiff, clunky iron boots and his arms were shackled and pulled straight down at his sides by taut chains bolted to the floor. He looked very nervous.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then shit started flying all over the place. He was standing in a wind tunnel. The force of the wind blew his baggy shirt and pants tight against his skinny body and the fabric flapped and rippled behind him frantically as his arms shook in the shackles, but the iron ski boots kept him from blowing away. The goggles protected his eyes but his mouth was wide open and his lips were pulled back exposing his teeth like a horse on one of those hillbilly postcards. He looked like he was screaming but the only sound was the whir of turbines and the rushing wind. That's where the footage ended, but I'm pretty sure his head got blown off soon after. I think it was some kind of experiment.<br>&nbsp;<br>And that's how I felt. Like a vaguely German prisoner in leg irons and chains whose scream could not be heard above the deaf girl wailing in my face. Soon my head would be gone too.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later, as Marlene was putting away the sharpo and the prober and humming loud and off-key to herself, Doug leaned towards me and said, "She's deaf you know." But he said it under his breath, discreetly, so she wouldn't hear.<br>&nbsp;<br>I spit more blood into the sink.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Doug spent most of his time freaking out in his back office, so that's how I got to know deaf Marlene.<br>&nbsp;<br>I'd never actually talked to a deaf person before but I'd been swimming and gotten water stuck in my ears lots of times, felt that underwater silence as I shook my head and watched people's mouths moving without hearing the words, so I knew what it was like for her. I could empathize. And I always used to watch reruns of The Facts of Life when I came home from school and I had vivid, uncomfortable memories of those episodes where Blair's stand up comedian cousin would mock herself to get laughs and teach tolerance to Mrs. Garrett and the rest of the girls. She had cerebral palsy but she talked like a deaf person, so the lesson was the same. I could sympathize, and pity.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hey so how long have you worked in this place?" I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was standing right next to me looking at a dental chart, and of course she couldn't hear a goddamn word I was saying. I barely resisted the impulse to clap or snap my fingers.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hey So How Long Have You Worked In This Place?" I said again, because sometimes it is hard to remember not to be an ass.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marlene glanced up in mid-sentence and saw that my mouth was moving, and when it stopped she smiled and nodded her head and laughed quietly and politely, just like hearing people do when they don't know what the fuck you just said. Blair's cousin was right. We are all the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>We stared at each other and it was so awkward I considered murdering myself or giving her the finger just for something to do, but instead I made a fist and stuck out my thumb and screwed it into my cheek. I saw a monkey do it on Sesame Street once. It means apple in sign language.<br>&nbsp;<br>"APPLE! LIKE THE MONKEY!" she shouted, genuinely excited. Deaf girls love Sesame Street. We both laughed for as long as we could, which was for much longer than it was funny.<br>&nbsp;<br>She had too many teeth going in different directions. Her hair was a frizzy mess, like she was three weeks past a bad perm, and the blond dye kit was obviously cheap and self-applied. But still, she pretty much looked like anybody else. She didn't look especially deaf. But she was. She was.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was the kind of silence you can only have when it's high noon, or when one of you is deaf.<br>&nbsp;<br>I pointed at her, then pinched my nose closed.<br>&nbsp;<br>She narrowed her eyes, confused, then shouted, "I'M NOT STINK!"<br>&nbsp;<br>And we laughed about that for a long time.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When the detective told me she was dead there was a pause in my head where I thought of absolutely nothing, a hitch where nothing happened, just before the engine caught. When it did I wanted to make myself scream "No!" and start crying, but I knew that I couldn't, even...</p><h2>Matthew: A Commentary. Volume 1: The Christbook, Matthew 1-12</h2><p>Recognized as a masterly commentary when it first appeared, Frederick Dale Bruner's study of Matthew is now available as a greatly revised and expanded two-volume work -- the result of seven years of careful refinement, enrichment, and updating.<br><br>Through this commentary, crafted especially for teachers, pastors, and Bible students, Bruner aims "to help God's people love what Matthew's Gospel says." Bruner's work is at once broadly historical and deeply theological. It is historical in drawing extensively on great church teachers through the centuries and on the classical Christian creeds and confessions. It is theological in that it unpacks the doctrines in each passage, chapter, and section of the Gospel. Consciously attempting to bridge past and present, Bruner asks both what Matthew's Gospel said to its first hearers and what it says to readers today. As a result, his commentary is profoundly relevant to contemporary congregations and to those who guide them.<br><br>Bruner's commentary is replete with lively, verse-by-verse discussion of Matthew's text. While each chapter expounds a specific topic or doctrine, the book's format consists of a vivid, original translation of the text followed by faithful exegesis and critical analysis, a survey of historical commentary on the text, and current applications of the text or theme under study. In this revision Bruner continues to draw on the best in modern scholarship -- including recent work by W. D. Davies and Dale C. Allison Jr., by Ulrich Luz, and by many others -- adding new voices to the reading of Matthew. At the same time he cites the classic commentaries of Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Bengel, and the rest, who, like Bruner himself, were not simply doctrinal teachers but also careful exegetes of Scripture. Such breadth and depth of learning assure that Bruner's Matthew will remain, as a reviewer for Interpretation wrote, "the most dog-eared commentary on the shelf."<br><br>Volume 1 of Bruner's commentary is called The Christbook because the first twelve chapters of Matthew are focused on the nature and work of Christ. As Bruner proceeds through these chapters, he shows how Matthew presents, step by step, central themes of Christology: Jesus' coming (chapters 1&#x2013;4), his teaching (5&#x2013;7), his miracles (8&#x2013;9), his sermon on mission (10), and his person (11&#x2013;12). Throughout the book there are also thoughtful discussions of significant topics such as baptism, marriage, Jewish-Christian relations, and heaven and hell.<br><br>Eminently readable, rich in biblical insight, and ecumenical in tone, Bruner's two-volume commentary on Matthew now stands among the best in the field.</p><p>Frederick Dale Bruner is George and Lyda Wasson Professor of Religion Emeritus at Whitworth University and scholar in residence at Fuller Theological Seminary. His other books include <em>A Theology of the Holy Spirit</em> and the two-volume <em>Matthew:</em><b>Eugene Peterson</b><br> "This is the kind of commentary that I most want &#x2014; a&nbsp;<i>theological</i>&nbsp;wrestling with Scripture. Frederick Dale Bruner grapples with the text not only as a technical exegete (although he also does that very well) but as a church theologian, caring passionately about what these words tell us about God and ourselves. Here he places his considerable teaching gifts at the service of the Christian community, caring as much about us as he cares about the text. His Matthew commentary is in the grand traditions of Augustine, Calvin, and Luther &#x2014; expansive and leisurely, loving the text, the people in it, and the Christians who read it."<br><br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i></b><br> "It is hard to think of another commentary that is more fruitful in terms of stimulating the kind of thinking about the meaning of the text that is the prerequisite for good preaching and teaching."<br><br><b><i>Themelios</i></b><br> "A hugely stimulating read . . . holds the reader's attention better than many commentaries. Emphases on mission and formation of Christian character also make this an important and valuable contribution to scholarship on Matthew's gospel."<br><br><b>William H. Willimon</b><br> "Bruner is concerned with Christian formation, with the daily task of living faithfully within today's church. His applications of the Gospel of Matthew and his frequent excursions into contemporary dilemmas for the church, such as church-state relations, marriage, liberation theology, feminism, and war, provide many stimulating insights for contemporary Christians."<br><br><b><i>Dialog</i></b><br> "Often Bruner's expositions are so apposite that the preacher will be tempted to lift them whole into the sermon, for they bring the biblical message explicitly into the life of the congregation."<br><br><b>Samuel Hugh Moffett</b><br> "An excitingly readable and innovative commentary on Matthew by one of America's master Bible teachers."<br><br><b><i>Perspectives in Religious Studies</i></b><br> "The value of Bruner's work is that what he is doing is so desperately needed and so rarely done at the level of sophistication reflected in his two volumes."<br><br><b><i>Currents in Theology and Mission</i></b><br> "This is a practical commentary for preachers and teachers in congregations. . . Marvelously successful."</p><h2>The Consciousness Instinct: Unraveling the Mystery of How the Brain Makes the Mind</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;The father of cognitive neuroscience&#x201d; illuminates the past, present, and future of the mind-brain problem</b></p><p>How do neurons turn into minds? How does physical &#x201c;stuff&#x201d;&#x2015;atoms, molecules, chemicals, and cells&#x2015;create the vivid and various worlds inside our heads?

In the last century there have been massive breakthroughs that have rewritten the science of the brain, and yet the puzzles faced by the ancient Greeks are still present. In <i>The Consciousness Instinct</i>, the neuroscience pioneer Michael S. Gazzaniga puts the latest research in conversation with the history of human thinking about the mind, giving a big-picture view of what science has revealed about consciousness.</p><p>The idea of the brain as a machine, first proposed centuries ago, has led to assumptions about the relationship between mind and brain that dog scientists and philosophers to this day. Gazzaniga asserts that this model has it backward&#x2015;brains make machines, but they cannot be reduced to one. New research suggests the brain is actually a confederation of independent modules working together.

Gazzaniga] adopts a philosophical approach in this insightful book . . . He also refreshingly grounds the work in real experimental data, revealing himself to be an intelligent mental explorer and master syncretist.

'What is consciousness?' can be a dizzying question, but Michael Gazzaniga offers an answer that&#x2019;s exciting and stimulating.

If there&#x2019;s such a thing as a stream of consciousness, he takes us to the headwaters." &#x2015;Alan Alda</p><p>"An invigorating and mind-expanding narrative on the science and philosophy of consciousness.

Gazzaniga brings us a democracy of consciousness. This part-historical, part-autobiographical telling of ingenious experiments reveals the uncanny plurality of self-awareness. Inspired by the Darwinian insight that populations of organisms struggle to assert their supremacy over of the worlds in which they live, Gazzaniga describes how single neurons and neural networks compete to signal their understanding of the cognitive micro-worlds in which they function, and how every module is a voice that in combination produces that enigmatic chorus we describe as consciousness." &#x2015;David Krakauer, President and William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems, Santa Fe Institute</p><p>"Understanding the mind-brain relationship has intrigued humans for millennia, but progress has fallen short of the mark, particularly regarding consciousness. The genius of <i>The Consciousness Instinct</i> is that it brings to the mind-brain discussion new perspectives ranging from evolutionary biology (i.e. how life emerged in a lifeless world) and engineering to the mental gymnastics necessary to understand quantum mechanics, all leavened by advances being made in the brain and cognitive sciences. It is a clarion call for a much broader view of the road ahead. For me, reading a book more than once is a rare occurrence, but this book was the exception and I felt amply rewarded for doing so." &#x2015;Marcus E. Raichle, M.D., Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor in Medicine, Washington University </p><p>"We should all be grateful that Michael Gazzaniga has not quit his effort to get us to think about hard problems. In <i>The Consciousness Instinct</i> he deals with the history of efforts to understand what it means to be conscious and also unconscious or not conscious. To understand how the meaning of being alive and also how the wave and quantum accounts of light illuminate consciousness, you will have to read this volume. For all who care about psychology, the trip is worth it." &#x2015;Michael Posner, Professor Emeritus of Psychology, University of Oregon</p></p><h2>The Line That Held Us</h2><p><b>An accidental death, and the cover-up that follows, sparks a dark series of events that reverberates through the lives of four people who will never be the same again.</b><br><br>When Darl Moody went hunting after a monster buck, a kill that could make the difference between meat for the winter and an empty freezer, he never expected he'd accidentally shoot a man digging ginseng. Worse yet, he's killed a Brewer, a family notorious for vengeance and violence.&nbsp;<br><br>With nowhere to turn, Darl calls on the help of the only man he knows will answer, his best friend, Calvin Hooper. But when Dwayne Brewer comes looking for his missing brother and stumbles onto a blood trail leading straight back to Darl and Calvin--and to Calvin's girlfriend, Angie--a nightmare of revenge rips apart their world.&nbsp;<br><br>A story of friendship and family, <i>The Line That Held Us </i>is a tale balanced between destruction and redemption, where the only hope is to hold on tight, clenching those you love.&nbsp; From a writer whose stories are "like a pull from a bottle of Appalachian moonshine: smooth and elegant with a punch in the gut that lingers a while after you're done" (<i>Garden &amp; Gun</i>), Joy's book is another masterwork of Southern noir.</p><p><b>David Joy</b> is the author of <i>The Weight of This World,&nbsp;Where All Light Tends to Go</i>, and <i>The Line That Held Us</i>, an Edgar finalist for Best First Novel. His stories and creative nonfiction have appeared in a number of publications, and he is the author of the memoir <i>Growing Gills: A Fly Fisherman's Journey.</i>One<br><br> Darl Moody didn't give a wet sack of shit what the state considered poaching. Way he figured, anybody who'd whittle a rifle season down to two weeks and not allot for a single doe day didn't care whether a man starved to death. Meat in the freezer was meat that didn't have to be bought and paid for, and that came to mean a lot when the work petered off each winter. So even though it was almost two months early, he was going hunting.<br><br> The buck Darl'd seen crossing from the Buchanan farm into Coon Coward's woods for the past two years had a rocking chair on his head and a neck thick as a tree trunk. Coon wouldn't let a man set foot on his land on account of the ginseng hidden there, but Coon was out of town. The old man had gone to the flatland to bury his sister and wouldn't be back for a week.<br><br> The cove was full of sign: rubs that stripped bark off maples and birch, scrapes all over the ground where button bucks scratched soil with something instinctual telling them to do so but lacking any rhyme or reason. A mature buck knew exactly what he was doing when he ripped at the ground like he was hoeing a line with his hooves, but the young ones ran around wild. They'd scrape all over the place, trying to add to a conversation they were too inexperienced to understand.<br><br> Darl locked his stand around a blackjack oak that grew twenty feet high before the first limbs sprung off. He climbed to a strong vantage and surveyed a saddle of land where early autumn cast patches of the mountains gold in afternoon light. An unseasonable cold snap following one of the driest summers the county had ever seen brought on fall a month ahead of schedule. It was the last week of September, but the ridgelines were already bare. Down in the valley, the trees were in full color with reds and oranges afire like embers, the acorns falling like raindrops. The nights were starting to frost and within a few weeks the first few breaths of winter would strip the mountains to their gray bones.<br><br> Darl sipped a pint of whiskey he had stashed in the cargo pocket of his camouflage pants, took off his ball cap and slicked the sweat from his forehead back through a widow's peak of thinning hair shaved close. He scratched at the thick beard on his chin and listened closely for any sign of movement, though just like the past two evenings, he'd yet to see or hear a thing but squirrels. Soon as the sun sank behind the western face, the woods dropped into shadow and it wouldn't be long for nightfall. Still, he would stay because there was no telling when that buck might show, and in full dark, he would find his way out by headlamp.<br><br> Somewhere up the hillside, a stick cracked beneath a footstep, and that sound came through his body like current. His heart raced and his palms grew sweaty, his eyes wide and white. Dried leaves rustled underfoot, and behind the scraggly limbs of a dead hemlock he could see a slight shift of movement, but from such distance and in such little light, what moved was impossible to discern. Through the riflescope, he spotted something on four legs, something gray-bodied and low to the ground. The 3-9x50mm CenterPoint was useless in low light, but it was all Darl could afford and so that was what he had.<br><br> Sighting the scope out as far as it would extend, he played the shot out in his mind. At two hundred yards, the animal filled a little less than a quarter of the sight picture. He rolled the bolt and pulled back only enough to check that a round was chambered, then locked the bolt back and thumbed away the safety.<br><br> A boar hog rooted around the hillside for a meal. Each year those pigs moved farther and farther north out of South Carolina, first coming up from Walhalla ten years back and now overrunning farms all across Jackson County. There was open season on hogs statewide due to the damage they caused. A father and son out of Caswell County were hunting private land between Brevard and Toxaway earlier that year when the son spooked a whole passel of hogs out of a laurel thicket, and the father drew down on a seven-hundred-pound boar. That was right over the ridgeline into Transylvania County. That pig weighed 580 pounds gutted, and they took home more than 150 pounds of sausage alone. Do the math on that at the grocery store.<br><br> All his life there'd been a thoughtlessness that came on before the kill. It was something hard to explain to anyone else, but that feeling was on him now as he braced the rifle against the trunk of the oak and tried to steady his aim, a mind whittled back to instinct. A tangle of brush obstructed his view, but he knew the Core-Lokt would tear through that just fine. He tried to get the picture to open by sliding his cheek along the buttstock, but the cheap scope offered little play. When the view was wide, he toyed with the power ring to get the picture as clear as possible, nothing ever coming fully into focus as he drew the crosshairs over the front shoulders. He centered on his pulse then. Breathe slowly. Count the breaths. Squeeze between heartbeats. On five, pull the trigger. The sight wavered as he counted down. Three. Two. Squeeze.<br><br> The rifle punched against his shoulder and the report hammered back in waves touching everything between here and there and returning in fragments as it bounced around the mountains. He checked downrange and the animal was felled.<br><br> "I got him," Darl said. His body tingled and his head was swimming. Adrenaline coursed through him and left him breathless. He was in disbelief. "I fucking got him."<br><br> Darl sucked down the last of the whiskey in one slug, slung his rifle over his shoulder, and climbed his way down with his treestand. In less than an hour, the light would be gone. He knew he had to hurry. There'd barely be enough time to field dress the pig and get it out of the woods before dark. Maybe Calvin Hooper would help him dress out the hog. Cal had a nice hoist for dressing deer, and that sure beat the hell out of the makeshift gambreling stick Darl had at the house. Whether you were scraping hair or skinning him out, a pig was a whole lot easier with two sets of hands working than one. Cal wouldn't want anything for the trouble. Never had. As soon as Darl got that pig back to the truck, he'd head to Calvin's. "I fucking got him," he said.<br><br> A small branch of water ran at the bottom of the draw, and through a thicket of laurel, the hillside steepened. Darl staggered through the copse of trees and slowly climbed until he was near the ledge where the pig had fallen. He tripped on a fishing line strung between two dogwoods, a pair of tin cans with rocks inside clanking loud in the limbs above him. Darl froze and looked around. As his eyes focused, he saw rusted fishhooks hung eye level from the trees, trotlines meant for poachers, and he brushed them back one by one as if he were clawing his way through spiderwebs. That's when he saw him. Not a pig but a man, flat on his stomach. A brush-patterned shirt was darkened almost black with blood, his pants the same grayish camouflage as his shirt.<br><br> Darl stepped closer, knelt by the man's legs, and placed his hand on the man's left calf. His body was warm, but there was no movement, no sound of breath. In absolute shock, Darl crawled forward and saw where the bullet had entered the man's rib cage. He'd been quartered away, the hollowpoint opening as it cut through him and exited behind his right shoulder, blowing the top of his arm ragged. The man's left arm hung by his side, his hand open, palm up, and Darl could see a few shriveled red berries balanced at the tip of his fingers. He realized then that he was kneeling in a thick patch of ginseng, mostly young, two-prong plants, but some much, much older. The man had an open book bag on the ground beside him with a tangle of thick, banded roots stuffed inside, the thin runners off the main ginseng shoots snarled like a muss of hair.<br><br> Darl knew the man shouldn't have been there the same as him. This was Coward land, and they were both trespassing; two poachers who shouldn't have been there, but right there they were. There they were, one of them gone from this world, and the other facing it in its enormity. While he crouched there on hands and knees, dumbstruck as a child, his mind washed between astonishment and terror.<br><br> The man's face was turned and angled into the ground. His neck was sunburned red and dotted with dark orange freckles, the back of his hair thick and curled, a yellow blond the color of hay. Darl stepped across the body, being careful not to get his boots in the blood around him. The man wore a camouflage hat with hunter orange lining the edge of the bill, the words caney fork general store stitched across the front. The hat was knocked crooked on his head and Darl grabbed the bill to try and turn the man's face out of the dirt.<br><br> As soon as he saw the dark purple birthmark covering the right side of the man's face, Darl knew him. Carol Brewer, who everyone called Sissy, lay stone-cold dead on the bracken-laced ground. Darl had known Carol all his miserable life, a half-wit born to a family that Jesus Christ couldn't have saved. Some people believed Carol's daddy, Red, might've been the devil himself. There was a meanness that coursed through him, a meanness that was as close to pure evil as any God-fearing man had ever known. Carol was the runt of the family and, by most accounts, the only one who ever had a chance. Some thought if he'd been able to get out from under the wings of his father and older brother, Dwayne, he might've been all right, but things didn't work out that way, and Carol wound up being as much trouble as the lot of them.<br><br> Darl let go of the cap bill and Carol's head came to rest on the ground. His eyes were closed with his mouth slightly opened. A yellow jacket buzzed by Darl's ear and landed on Carol's lips. The wasp started to crawl into his mouth but Darl swatted the bug away, his fingers brushing Carol's face. He stomped the bee where it hovered above the ground, then looked to the west to gauge what light remained. Darl knew it wouldn't be long, though nightfall didn't matter like it had minutes before. His thoughts were wild with what would come, but he knew the darkness was a gift now and he welcomed it. His mind raced as the night slowly closed around him like cupped hands. He had until dawn to dig a grave.<br><br> Two<br><br> Dwayne Brewer goose-stepped down the beer aisle of the Franklin Walmart wearing a latex chimp mask he'd found on the floor by the Halloween decorations. The mask was hot and his breathing was loud. The inside smelled of cheap molded rubber and he slicked the nylon hair back through his fingers while he chuckled at a woman who sneered.<br><br> She wore pastel-colored scrubs and white tennis shoes, her highlighted hair pulled back in a ponytail. Through the eye slits of the mask, he saw a little girl, maybe six years old, with one of her fingers hooked in the corner of her mouth, standing beside the woman. Dwayne scratched under his armpit with one hand and clawed at the back of his head with the other, hopping around bowlegged like a monkey, and the child laughed. He pulled the mask off and tossed it into the open cooler, his skin cold with sweat as he ran his hand over his face and reached for a case of Bud heavy. Tearing a ragged hole in the cardboard, he fished out a beer and cracked the top.<br><br> "Have a blessed day," he said with a wide smile, tilting the open can toward the woman and nodding. She eyed him like the fiend he was, her little girl hiding behind her leg, spellbound with curiosity as the giant man before her swallowed half the can in one tremendous gulp.<br><br> The thing about Walmart was that even a man like Dwayne Brewer could go unnoticed. People pushed their buggies with dead-eyed stares, everything sliding by in the periphery. Consumerism scaled this large had a way of camouflaging class.<br><br> At the end of the aisle, he squeezed past a beefy gal in tiny shorts who had a baby on each hip and three children running circles around her. One of the kids reached out as he made his next lap and knocked an endcap of Cool Ranch Doritos onto the floor. The woman was in the middle of a conversation with someone she knew, an older woman who had a toddler with her finger up her nose riding in the buggy. The beefy gal kept saying over and over, "Lord no this ain't mine," shaking the child on her left hip, "Me and Clyde stopped after this one," shaking the one on her right, "This here's Sara's. You remember Sara, don't you? This is Sara's little girl, Tammy. She's my niece."<br><br> Buggies were banging and lights were flashing and cash registers were beeping and kids were wrestling a Halloween blow-up ghost decoration that was meant to stand in a front yard and the sheer madness of it was enough to send any sane person into a seizure, but Dwayne didn't have a care in this world. He strutted right through the middle of the chaos, smiling because it was Friday and he had a wad of cash in his pocket from pawning five stolen chainsaws and a flat-screen TV.<br><br> Black teddies and bloodred lingerie were rolled back to $9.87. He finished that first beer standing by the floor rack running satin through his fingers with his eyes closed, daydreaming about the last woman he'd slept with. When he was finished, he crumpled the can in his fist, balanced it in the cup of a beige-colored bra, and opened another.<br><br> From where he stood, he could see straight down the shoe aisle where a kid sat on a bench. The boy reminded Dwayne of his brother. Shaggy, strawberry-blond hair covered his ears, and his red skin was dotted with freckles. Aside from a thick pair of Coke-bottle glasses, black military frames, he could've been a spitting image of Sissy at thirteen or fourteen years old. The kid wore a shabby shirt and grass-stained jeans that were muddied at the knees. He was trying on a pair of gray-colored tennis shoes, some off-brand jobs with Velcro straps. Out of nowhere two boys came around the corner and loomed over him. A boy in tight jeans, with hair that sliced at an angle across his eyes, snatched one of the shoes out of the boy's hands, looked it over, shook his head, and crowed.</p><h2>Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft</h2><p><b>By his early thirties, Paul Allen was a world-famous billionaire-and that was just the beginning.&nbsp;</b><br><br>In 2007 and 2008,&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;named Paul Allen, the cofounder of Microsoft, one of the hundred most influential people in the world.

Weaving together political, social, and cultural developments in Palestine under the British mandate, Shapira creates a tapestry through which to understand the challenges of Israeli nation building, including mass immigration, shifting cultural norms, the politics of war and world diplomacy, and the creation of democratic institutions and a civil society. References to contemporary diaries, memoirs, and literature bring a human dimension to this narrative history of Israel from its declaration of independence in 1948 through successive decades of waging war, negotiating peace, and building a modern state with a vibrant society and culture. <p></p>Based on archival sources and the most up-to-date scholarly research, this authoritative history is a must-read for anyone with a passionate interest in Israel. Israel: A History will be the gold standard in the field for years to come.</p><p>ANITA SHAPIRA is a professor emerita at Tel Aviv University. An internationally acclaimed scholar with a special interest in social and cultural history, Shapira has published pathbreaking studies on the history of Zionism, Jewish-Arab relations, and the state of Israel."[A]n indispensable guide. . . . The author is at her best focusing on economic, social, and culture history--she makes deft use of Hebrew literature to illuminate her points, and she succinctly captures the zeitgeist of the times."-- "Publishers Weekly"<br><br>"Shapira's Israel has many strengths. . . . That go hand in hand with her rapid, suggestive illumination of themes."-- "Jewish Review of Books"<br><br>"A fascinating new one-volume history of Israel by the eminent Israeli historian Anita Shapira explains Arab thinking about partition back in 1947 and the many other unexpected and real events that have comprised Israel's history from the beginnings of the Zionist movement in the 1890s through the second intifada in 2001. Unlike other histories that often tell Israel's story by jumping from one war to the next, this one, called "Israel: A History" (Brandeis), captures the nation's diversity and cultural richness along with its existential struggles."-- "Jewish Week"<br><br>"This is surely a much-needed primer for an English-language audience that is often unaware of the intricacies of the country's social past, knowing only about the battles and intifadas that seem to make up its history. . . .

Grandpa's bellow shook the foundation of the house.<p>"Why me?" Rose wiped the dish soap suds from her hands with a kitchen towel, swiped the crossbow from the hook, and stomped onto the porch. </p><p>"Roooosie!" </p><p>She kicked the screen door open. He towered in the yard, a huge shaggy bear of a man, deranged eyes opened wide, tangled beard caked with blood and quivering grayish shreds. She leveled the crossbow at him. Drunk as hell again. </p><p>"What is it?" </p><p>"I want to go to the pub. I want a pint." His voice slipped into a whine. "Gimme some money!" </p><p>"No." </p><p>He hissed at her, swaying unsteadily on his feet. "Rosie! This is your last chance to give me a dollar!" </p><p>She sighed and shot him. The bolt bit between the eyes and Grandpa toppled onto his back like a log. His legs drummed the ground. </p><p>Rose rested the butt of her crossbow on her hip. "All right, come out." </p><p>The two boys slipped from behind the huge oak spreading its branches over the yard. Both were filthy with reddish mud, sap, and the other unidentifiable substances an eight- and a ten-year-old could find in the Wood. A jagged scratch decorated Georgie's neck and brown pine straw stuck out of his blond hair. Red welts marked the skin between Jack's knuckles. He saw her looking at his hands. His eyes got big, amber irises flaring yellow, and he hid his fists behind his back. </p><p>"How many times do I have to say it: don't touch the ward stones. Look at Grandpa Cletus! He's been eating dog brains again, and now he's drunk. It will take me half an hour to hose him off." </p><p>"We miss him," Georgie said. </p><p>She sighed. "I miss him, too. But he's no good to anybody drunk. Come on, you two, let's take him back to his shed. Help me get the legs." </p><p>Together they dragged Grandpa's inert form back to the shed at the edge of the clearing and dumped him on his sawdust. Rose uncoiled the metal chain from the corner, pulled it across the shed, locked the collar on Grandpa's neck, and peeled back his left eyelid to check the pupil. No red yet. Good shot&#x2014;he would be out for hours. </p><p>Rose put her foot on his chest, grasped the bolt, and pulled it out with a sharp tug. She still remembered Grandpa Cletus as he was, a tall, dapper man, uncanny with his rapier, his voice flavored with a light Scottish brogue. Even as old as he was, he would still win against Dad one out of three times in a swordfight. Now he was this . . . this thing. She sighed. It hurt to look at him, but there was nothing to be done about it. As long as Georgie lived, so did Grandpa Cletus. </p><p>The boys brought the hose. She turned it on, set the sprayer on jet, and leveled the stream at Grandpa until all the blood and dog meat were gone. She had never quite figured out how "going down to the pub" equaled chasing stray dogs and eating their brains, but when Grandpa got out of his ward circle, no mutt was safe. By the time she was done washing him, the hole in his forehead had closed. When Georgie raised things from the dead, he didn't just give them life. He made them almost indestructible. </p><p>Rose stepped out of the shed, locked the door behind her, and dragged the hose back to the porch. Her skin prickled as she crossed the invisible boundary: the kids must've put the ward stones back. She squinted at the grass. There they were, a line of small, seemingly ordinary rocks, spaced three, four feet from each other. Each rock held a small magic charge. Together they created an enchanted barrier, strong enough to keep Grandpa in the shed if he broke the chain again. </p><p>Rose waved the boys to the side and raised the hose. "Your turn." </p><p>They flinched at the cold water. She washed them off methodically, from top to bottom. As the mud melted from Jack's feet, she saw a two-inch rip in his Skechers. Rose dropped the hose. </p><p>"Jack!" </p><p>He cringed. </p><p>"Those are forty-five-dollar shoes!" </p><p>"I'm sorry," he whispered. </p><p>"Tomorrow is the first school day! What were you doing?" </p><p>"He was climbing up the pines to get at the leech birds," Georgie said. </p><p>She glared. "Georgie! Thirty-minute timeout tonight for snitching." </p><p>Georgie bit his lip. </p><p>Rose stared at Jack. "Is that true? You were chasing the leech birds?" </p><p>"I can't help it. Their tails are so flittery . . ." </p><p>She wanted to smack him. It was true, he couldn't help it&#x2014;it wasn't his fault he was born as a cat&#x2014;but those were brand-new shoes she had bought him for school. Shoes for which she had painstakingly tweaked their budget, scrimping every penny, so he wouldn't have to wear Georgie's old beat-up sneakers, so he could look just as nice as all the other second graders. It just hurt. </p><p>Jack's face pinched into a rigid white mask&#x2014;he was about to cry. </p><p>A small spark of power tugged on her. "Georgie, stop trying to resurrect the shoes. They were never alive in the first place." </p><p>The spark died. </p><p>An odd desperation claimed her, her pain shifting into a sort of numbness. Pressure built in her chest. She was so sick of it, sick of counting every dollar, sick of rationing everything, sick to death of it all. She had to go and get Jack a new pair of shoes. Not for Jack's sake, but for the sake of her own sanity. Rose had no clue how she would make up the money, but she knew she had to buy him a new pair of shoes right now, or she would explode. </p><p>"Jack, do you remember what will happen if a leech bird bites you?" </p><p>"I'll turn into one?" </p><p>"Yes. You have to stop chasing the birds." </p><p>He hung his head. "Am I punished?" </p><p>"Yes. I'm too mad to punish you right now. We'll talk about it when we get home. Go brush your teeth, comb your hair, put on dry clothes, and get the guns. We're going to Wal-Mart." </p><p></p><p>The old Ford truck bounced on the bumps in the dirt road. The rifles clanged on the floor. Georgie put his feet down to steady them without being asked. </p><p>Rose sighed. Here, in the Edge, she could protect them well enough. But they were about to pass from the Edge into another world, and their magic would die in the crossing. The two hunting rifles on the floor would be their only defense. Rose felt a pang of guilt. If it wasn't for her, they wouldn't need the rifles. God, she didn't want to be jumped again. Not with her brothers in the car. </p><p>They lived between worlds: on one side lay the Weird and the other the Broken. Two dimensions, existing side by side, like mirror images of each other. In the place where the dimensions "touched," they intersected slightly, forming a narrow ribbon of land that belonged to both of them&#x2014;the Edge. In the Weird, magic pooled deeply; in the Edge it was a shallow trickle. But in the Broken, no magic shielded them at all. </p><p>Rose eyed the Wood hugging the road, its massive trees crowding the narrow ribbon of packed dirt. She drove this way every day to her job in the Broken, but today the shadows between the gnarled trunks filled her with anxiety. </p><p>"Let's play the 'You Can't' Game," she said to stave off the rising dread. "Georgie, you go first." </p><p>"He went first the last time!" Jack's eyes shone with amber. </p><p>"Nyaha!" </p><p>"Yaha!" </p><p>"Georgie goes first," she repeated. </p><p>"Past the boundary, you can't raise dead things," Georgie said. </p><p>"Past the boundary, you can't grow fur and claws," Jack said. </p><p>They always played the Game when driving through to the Broken. It was a good reminder to the boys of what they could and could not do, and it worked much better than any lecture. Very few people in the Broken knew of the Edge or the Weird, and it was safer for everyone involved to keep it that way. Experience had taught her that trying to explain the existence of magic to a person in the Broken would do no good. It wouldn't get you committed into a mental institution, but it did land you into the kooky idiot category and made people give you a wide berth during lunch hour. </p><p>For most people of the Broken, there was no Broken, no Edge, and no Weird. They lived in the United States of America, on the continent of North America, on the planet Earth&#x2014;and that was that. For their part, most people in the Weird couldn't see the boundary either. It took a special kind of person to find it and the kids needed to remember that. </p><p>Georgie touched her hand. It was her turn. "Past the boundary, you can't hide behind a ward stone." She glanced at them, but they kept going, oblivious to her fears. </p><p>The road lay deserted. Few Edgers drove up this way this time of the evening. Rose accelerated, eager to get the trip over with and be back to the safety of the house. </p><p>"Past the boundary, you can't find lost things," Georgie said. </p><p>"Past the boundary, you can't see in the dark." Jack grinned. </p><p>"Past the boundary, you can't flash," Rose said. </p><p>The flash was her greatest weapon. Most Edgers had their own specific talents: some prophesied, some cured toothaches, some raised the dead like Georgie. Some cursed like Rose and her grandmother. But flashing could be learned by anyone with a drop of magic. It wasn't a matter of talent, but of practice. You took a hold of the magic inside you and channeled it from your body in a controlled burst that looked like a whip or a ribbon of lightning. If you had magic and patience, you could learn to flash, and the lighter the color of your flash, the hotter and more potent it was. A powerful bright flash was a terrible weapon. It could slice through a body like a hot knife through butter. Most Edgers never could get their flash bright enough to kill or injure anything with it. They were mongrels, living in a place of diluted magic, and most flashed red and dark orange. Some lucky few managed green or blue. </p><p>It was her flash that had started all of their trouble. </p><p>No, Rose reflected, they'd had plenty of trouble before her. Draytons were always unlucky. Too smart and too twisted for their own good. Grandpa was a pirate and a rover. Dad was a gold-digger. Grandma was stubborn like a goat and always thought she knew better than anyone else. Mom was a tramp. But all those problems didn't affect anyone but the individual Draytons. When Rose flashed white at the Graduation Fair, she focused the attention of countless Edge families squarely on their little clan. Even now, even with the rifles on the floor, she didn't regret it. She felt guilty about it, she wished things hadn't gone the way they did, but given a chance, she would do it again. </p><p>Ahead the road curved. Rose took the turn a bit too fast. The truck's springs creaked. </p><p>A man stood in the road, like a gray smudge against the encroaching twilight. </p><p>She slammed on the brakes. The Ford skidded in a screech on the hard, dry dirt of the road. She caught a glimpse of long pale hair and piercing green eyes staring straight at her. </p><p>The truck hurtled at him. She couldn't stop it. </p><p>The man leapt straight up. Feet in dark gray boots landed on the hood of the truck with a thud and vanished. The man vaulted over the roof to the side and disappeared into the trees. </p><p>The truck slid to a stop. Rose gulped the air. Her heart fluttered in her chest. Her fingertips tingled and she tasted bitterness on her tongue. </p><p>She stabbed the seat belt release button, threw the door open, and jumped out onto the road. "Are you hurt?" </p><p>The Wood lay quiet. </p><p>"Hello?" </p><p>No answer. The man was gone. </p><p>"Rose, who was that?" Georgie's eyes were the size of small saucers. </p><p>"I don't know." Relief flooded her. She hadn't hit him. She got scared out of her wits, but she hadn't hit him. Everybody was fine. Nobody was hurt. Everybody was fine . . . </p><p>"Did you see the swords?" Jack asked. </p><p>"What swords?" All she'd seen were the blond hair, green eyes, and some kind of cloak. She couldn't even recall his face&#x2014;just a pale smudge. </p><p>"He had a sword," Georgie said. "On his back." </p><p>"Two swords," Jack corrected. "One on the back and one on his belt." </p><p>Some of the older locals liked to play with swords, but none of them had long blond hair. And none of them had eyes like that. Most people facing a truck head on would be scared. He stared her down as if she had insulted him by nearly running him over. Like he was some sort of king of the road. </p><p>Strangers were never good in the Edge. It wasn't wise to linger. </p><p>Jack sniffed the air, wrinkling his nose the way he did when he looked for a scent trail. "Let's find him." </p><p>"Let's not." </p><p>"Rose . . ." </p><p>"You're on thin ice already." She climbed into the truck and shut the door. "We're not chasing after some knucklehead who thinks he's too important to walk on the shoulder." She snorted, trying to get her heart rate under control. </p><p>Georgie opened his mouth. </p><p>"Not another word." </p><p>A couple of minutes later, they reached the boundary, the point where the Edge ended and the Broken began. Rose always recognized the precise moment when she passed into the Broken. First, anxiety stabbed right through her chest, followed by an instant of intense vertigo, and then pain. It was as if the shiver of magic, the warm spark that existed somewhere inside her, died during the crossing. The pain lasted only a blink, but she always dreaded it. It left her feeling incomplete. Broken. That's how the name for the magic-less dimension had come about. </p><p>There was an identical boundary on the opposite end of the Edge, the one that guarded the passage to the Weird. She never tried to cross it. She wasn't sure her magic would be strong enough for her to survive. </p><p>They entered the Broken without any trouble. The Wood ended with the Edge. Mundane Georgia oaks and pines replaced the ancient dark trees. The dirt became pavement. </p><p>The narrow two-lane road brought them past the twin gas stations to the parkway. Rose checked the parkway for the oncoming traffic, took a right, and headed toward the town of Pine Barren. </p><p>Above them an airplane thundered, fixing to land at the Savannah airport only a couple of miles away. The woods gave way to half-finished shopping plazas and construction equipment, scattered among heaps of red Georgia mud. Ponds and streams interrupted the landscape&#x2014;with the coast only forty minutes away, every hole in the ground sooner or later filled up with water. They passed hotels, Comfort Inn, Knights Inn, Marriott, Embassy Suites, stopped at a light, crossed the overpass, and finally turned into a busy Wal-Mart parking lot. </p><p>Rose parked on the side and held the door open, letting the boys out. Jack's eyes had lost their amber sheen. Now they were plain dark hazel. She locked the truck, checked the door just in case&#x2014;locked up tight&#x2014;and headed to the brightly lit doors. </p><p>"Now remember," she said as they joined the herd of evening shoppers. "Shoes and that's it. I mean it." </p></p><h2>Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future</h2><p><p><strong>From the authors of the best-selling <em>The Second Machine Age</em>, a leader&#x2019;s guide to success in a rapidly changing economy.</strong></p><p>We live in strange times.

The Syrian civil war has displaced half the country's population, and ISIS and other jihadi groups thrive in the political vacuum there and in Iraq, setting a new standard for political violence. Meanwhile, regimes in Egypt and Bahrain have become even more repressive after the uprisings there, and Libya and Yemen have virtually ceased to exist as states. <br><br>The hallmarks of this new Middle East are rebellion and repression, proxy wars, sectarian strife, the rise of the Islamic State, and intraregional polarization. International and regional actors stoke the flames, with the United States and Russia seeking to reposition themselves in the region and Saudi Arabia and Iran vying for supremacy. In the long term, perils including climate change, food and water insecurity, and population growth, along with bad governance and stagnant economies, will determine the destiny of the region. <br><br>In <em>The New Middle East: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em>, renowned Middle East scholar James L. Gelvin explains all these developments and more in a concise question-and-answer format. Outlining the social, political, and economic contours of the New Middle East, he illuminates the current crisis in the region and explores how the region will continue to change in the decades to come.<br></p><p><br><strong>James L.

In student-led movements, women, minorities, immigrants, and indigenous people demanded that universities adapt to better serve the increasingly heterogeneous public and student bodies. The success of these movements had a profound impact on the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century: out of these efforts were born ethnic studies, women&#x2019;s studies, and American studies.<br> &nbsp;<br> In&nbsp;<i>We Demand,</i>&nbsp;Roderick A. Ferguson demonstrates that less than fifty years since this pivotal shift in the academy, the university is moving away from &#x201c;the people&#x201d; in all their diversity. Today the university is refortifying its commitment to the defense of the status quo off campus and the regulation of students, faculty, and staff on campus. The progressive forms of knowledge that the student-led movements demanded and helped to produce are being attacked on every front. Not only is this a reactionary move against the social advances since the &#x2019;60s and &#x2019;70s&#x2014;it is part of the larger threat of anti-intellectualism in the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&#x201c;<i>We Demand</i> does much more than chronicle how student protests tried to remake the university and its intellectual agendas to reflect the diverse, divergent, dissenting bodies that make up the world&#x2014;it delivers an incisive and sobering account of reaction, of academic complicity in restoring the status quo and its exclusionary, anti-intellectual structures. Roderick Ferguson&#x2019;s writing on the university is always on time, always urgent, and always aware that the struggle over knowledge is inseparable from the fight for our lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i><br> &#x201c;Roderick&nbsp;Ferguson&#x2019;s <i>We Demand</i>&nbsp;is an enormously valuable text. It introduces students to the political history of the universities they inhabit, and it defamiliarizes features of those institutions that students might take for granted. And Ferguson provides a provocative intervention in critical university studies by centering student movements and especially those of students of color in the story. Ferguson frames the recent history of universities as a site of struggle in which universities have transformed themselves in response to student protest. He thus offers inspiration that we all need in this moment of renewed struggle for democratic and inclusive universities that make and share knowledge in the interest of social justice.&#x201d;&#x2014;Miranda Joseph, author of <i>Debt to Society: Accounting for Life under Capitalism</i><b>Roderick A.

This relationship - between young people and the empathetic music that sets them off down a road of self-discovery and self-definition - is emo, a much-maligned, mocked, and misunderstood term that has existed for nearly two decades, but has flourished only recently. In <i>Nothing Feels Good</i>, Andy Greenwald makes the case for emo as more than a genre - it's an essential rite of teenagehood. From the '80s to the '00s, from the basement to the stadium, from tour buses to chat rooms, and from the diary to the computer screen, <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> narrates the story of emo from the inside out and explores the way this movement is taking shape in real time and with real hearts on the line. <i>Nothing Feels Good </i>is the first book to explore this exciting moment in music history and Greenwald has been given unprecedented access to the bands and to their fans. He captures a place in time and a moment on the stage in a way only a true music fan can.</p></p><p><p><b>Andy Greenwald</b> is a senior contributing writer at <i>Spin</i>.

He lives in Brooklyn, NY.</p>No one has ever gone broke underestimating the American teenager's capacity for angst--until now, perhaps, when, as Greenwald documents, the major commercial music purveyors pay scant attention to the youngsters buying hundreds of thousands of copies of albums by bands like Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard [Confessional], even though the rest of the music industry is in the doldrums. Those bands create a sort of personal music, low on bombast and the antithesis of overproduced; they aren't boy bands and Britney Spears knockoffs. Emo, as their music is known, combines the thoughtfulness of folk with the sensibilities and DIY ethos of punk. Emo bands appeal with introspective lyrics rather than the "see my clothes, see my butt" treacle major labels promote. Sailing under the hype radar, emo is the current manifestation of music that is perfect for the young; that is, unknown and inaccessible to adults. A valuable resource for young listeners and adults who want to know their music; get it before emo goes the corporate way of "alternative" rock. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He was toting a box of pipe fittings in one hand, tool kit in the other. He&#x2019;d been sent so hastily by the maintenance manager he didn&#x2019;t even have the bloody name of his customer. But his mind was on earlier doings in another building, a small office building in lower Manhattan. He&#x2019;d taken the morning off from his plumbing business to interview for an assistant engineer job. The pay would start low, but the job would take him in a more ambitious direction. They had looked at him with only the faintest interest when he&#x2019;d walked into the Feeben, Leiber, and Quiffe Engineering Firm. The two interviewers were a couple of snotty wankers&#x2014;one of them was Feeben Junior. They seemed bored by the time they called him in, and their faint flicker of interest evaporated completely when he started talking about his background. He had done his best to speak in American phraseology, to suppress his accent. But he knew it slipped out. They were looking for some snappy young chap out of New York University, not a cockney blighter who&#x2019;d worked his way through the East London School of Engineering and Mechanical Vocation.<br>Bill heard them say it, through the door, after they&#x2019;d dismissed him: &#x201c;Another limey grease monkey...&#x201d;<br>All right then. So he was a grease monkey. Just a mechanic and, lately, a freelance plumbing contractor. <i>A dirty little job screwin&#x2019; pipes for the nobs.</i> Heading up to some rich bloke&#x2019;s penthouse. There was no shame in it.<br>But there wasn&#x2019;t much money in it either, working on assignment for Chinowski&#x2019;s Maintenance. It&#x2019;d be a long time before he could save up enough to start a big contracting outfit of his own. He had a couple of lads hired on, from time to time, but not the big contracting and engineering company he&#x2019;d always envisioned. And Mary Louise had made it clear as polished glass she was not really interested in marrying a glorified plumber.<br>&#x201c;I had enough of fellas that think they&#x2019;re the cat&#x2019;s meow because they can fix the terlet,&#x201d; she said. A pretty girl from the Bronx was Mary Louise Fensen and raring to go. But not terribly bright, after all. Probably drive him barmy anyway.<br>The moment he&#x2019;d got home the phone rang, Bud Chinowski, barking about getting his ass to an address in Manhattan, on Park Avenue. Their building maintenance was AWOL&#x2014;probably drunk somewhere&#x2014;and the Bigshot at the penthouse needed plumbers &#x201c;fast as you can drag your lazy ass over there. We&#x2019;ve got three bathrooms to finish installing. Get those witless wrench-jockeys of yours over there too.&#x201d;<br>He&#x2019;d called Roy Phinn and Pablo Navarro to go on ahead of him. Then he&#x2019;d changed out of the ill-fitting suit, into the gray, grease-stained coveralls. &#x201c;Limey grease monkey...&#x201d; he&#x2019;d murmured, buttoning up.<br>And here he was, wishing he&#x2019;d taken time for a cigarette before coming&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t smoke in a posh flat like this without permission. He stepped glumly out of the elevator, into an antechamber to the penthouse, his toolbox clanking at his side. The little wood-paneled room was scarcely bigger than the elevator. An artfully paneled mahogany door with a brass knob, embossed with an eagle, was its only feature&#x2014;besides a small metal grid next to the door. He tried the knob. Locked. He shrugged, and knocked on the door. Waiting, he started to feel a little claustrophobic.<br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Ello?&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Plumbin&#x2019; contractor! From Chinowski&#x2019;s! &#x2019;Ello!&#x201d; <i>Don&#x2019;t drop your Hs, you bastard,</i> he told himself. &#x201c;<i>Hel</i>-lo!&#x201d;<br>A crackling sound, and a low, forceful voice emanated from the grid. &#x201c;That the other plumber, is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uh...&#x201d; He bent and spoke briskly into the grid. &#x201c;It is, sir!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No need to shout into the intercom!&#x201d;<br>The door clicked within itself&#x2014;and to Bill&#x2019;s amazement it didn&#x2019;t swing inward but slid into the wall up to the knob. He saw there was a metal runner in the floor and, at the edge of the door, a band of steel. It was wood on the outside, steel inside. Like this man was worried someone might try to fire a bullet through it.<br>No one was visible on the other side of the open doorway. He saw another hallway, carpeted, with some rather fine old paintings, one of which might be by a Dutch master, if he remembered anything from his trips to the British Museum. A Tiffany lamp stood on an inlaid table, glowing like a gem.<br><i>This toff&#x2019;s got plenty of the ready,</i> Bill thought.<br>He walked down the hall, into a large, plush sitting room: luxurious sofas, a big unlit fireplace, more choice paintings and fine lamps. A grand piano, its wood polished almost mirrorlike, stood in a corner. On an intricately carved table was an enormous display of fresh flowers in an antique Chinese jade vase. He&#x2019;d never seen flowers like them before. And the decorations on the tables&nbsp;...<br>He was staring at a lamp that appeared to be a gold sculpture of a satyr chasing an underdressed young woman when a voice spoke sharply to his right. &#x201c;The other two are already at work in the back&nbsp;... The main bathroom&#x2019;s through here.&#x201d; Bill turned and saw a gent in the archway to the next room already turning away from him. The man wore a gray suit, his dark hair oiled back. Must be the butler. Bill could hear the other two lads, faintly, in the back of the place, arguing about fittings.<br>Bill went through the archway as the man in the suit answered a chiming gold and ivory telephone on a table in front of a big window displaying the heroic spires of Manhattan. Opposite the window was a mural, done in the sweeping modern-industrial style, of burly men building a tower that rose up out of the sea. Overseeing the workers in the mural was a slim dark-haired man with blueprints in his hand.<br>Bill looked for the WC, saw a hallway with a gleaming steel and white-tile bathroom at its end.<br><i>That&#x2019;s my destination,</i> Bill thought bitterly. <i>The crapper. A fine crapper it might be, one of three. My destiny is to keep their WCs in working order.</i><br>Then he caught himself. <i>No self-pity, now, Bill McDonagh. Play the cards you&#x2019;re dealt, the way your Da taught you.</i><br>Bill started toward the door to the bathroom hall, but his attention was caught by the half-whispered urgency of the man&#x2019;s voice as he growled at the telephone.<br>&#x201c;Eisley, you will not make excuses! If you cannot deal with these people I will find someone who has the courage! I&#x2019;ll find someone brave enough to scare away this pack of hungry dogs! They will not find my campfire undefended!&#x201d;<br>The voice&#x2019;s stridency caught Bill&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;but something else about it stirred him too. He&#x2019;d heard that distinctive voice before. Maybe in a newsreel?<br>Bill paused at the door to the hall and had a quick look at the man pressing the phone to his ear. It was the man in the mural&#x2014;the one holding the blueprint: a straight-backed man, maybe early forties, medium height, two thin, crisply straight strokes of mustache matched by the dark strokes of his eyebrows, a prominent cleft chin. He even wore a suit nearly identical to the one in the painting. And that strong, intense face&#x2014;it was a face Bill knew from the newspapers. He&#x2019;d seen his name over the front door of this very edifice. It never occurred to him that Andrew Ryan might actually <i>live</i> here. The tycoon owned a significant chunk of America&#x2019;s coal, its second biggest railroad, and Ryan Oil. He&#x2019;d always pictured a man like that whiling the days away playing golf on a country estate.<br>&#x201c;Taxes are theft, Eisley! What? No, no need&#x2014;I fired her. I&#x2019;ve got a new secretary starting today&#x2014;I&#x2019;m elevating someone in reception. Elaine something. No, I don&#x2019;t want anyone from accounting, that&#x2019;s the whole problem, people like that are too interested in my money, they have no discretion! Sometimes I wonder if there&#x2019;s anyone I can trust. Well they&#x2019;ll get not a penny out of me more than absolutely necessary, and if you can&#x2019;t see to it I&#x2019;ll find a lawyer who can!&#x201d;<br>Ryan slammed the phone down&#x2014;and Bill hurried on to the bathroom.<br>Bill found the toilet in place but not quite hooked up: an ordinary Standard toilet, no gold seat on it.

But no book until this one has managed to penetrate its wall of silence or go beyond the usual polemics to analyze its actual effects on its customers, workers, and suppliers. Drawing on unprecedented interviews with former Wal-Mart executives and a wealth of staggering data (e.g., Americans spend $36 million an hour at Wal-Mart stores, and in 2004 its growth alone was bigger than the total revenue of 469 of the Fortune 500), <i>The Wal-Mart Effect</i> is an intimate look at a business that is dramatically reshaping our lives.</p><p>Charles Fishman has been a senior editor at the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i> and the <i>News &amp; Observer</i> and is now a senior editor at <i>Fast Company</i>. In 2005 he won the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award for business journalism.Do you shop at Wal-Mart, or avoid it like the plague? THE WAL-MART EFFECT may change your shopping habits, and it most certainly will affect your perception of economics and business practice today. Charles Fishman takes a hard look at supply, demand, and pricing, as well as business practice as developed by Sam Walton, and now his children. Alan Sklar brings his narrating experience in reading nonfiction to bear on this "tell all" book. Sklar approaches each revelation with fresh enthusiasm, even when Fishman's text is repetitive. Delving into Wal-Mart's secrets will change your perception of marketing and business forever.

Captured by slave traders at the age of sixteen, Brace was transported to Barbados, where he experienced the shock and trauma of slave-breaking and was sold to a New England ship captain. After fighting as an enslaved sailor for two years in the Seven Years War, Brace was taken to New Haven, Connecticut, and sold into slavery. After several years in New England, Brace enlisted in the Continental Army in hopes of winning his manumission. After five years of military service, he was honorably discharged and was freed from slavery. As a free man, he chose in 1784 to move to Vermont, the first state to make slavery illegal. There, he met and married an African woman, bought a farm, and raised a family. Although literate, he was blind when he decided to publish his life story, which he narrated to a white antislavery lawyer, Benjamin Prentiss, who published it in 1810. Upon his death in 1827, Brace was a well-respected abolitionist. In this first new edition since 1810, Kari J. Winter provides a historical introduction, annotations, and original documents that verify and supplement our knowledge of Brace's life and times.</p><p>Wisconsin Studies in AutobiographyWisconsin Studies in Autobiography William L.

This portable, easy-to-use guide directs readers to the city's newest architectural gems, all completed in the 21st century with some still under construction. Divided into ten 1- to 3-mile walks that extend from Columbia University through lower Manhattan and across to Brooklyn and Queens, this guidebook highlights over 150 buildings, popular destinations like the High Line and Lincoln Center, and trendy locations such as Williamsburg and the Bowery. Led by author John Hill, these tours are highly informative, engaging, and filled with fascinating insights and details. Maps and numerous photographs make this guide the perfect companion for anyone visiting New York City, architecture buffs, and those wishing to better know the city they call home.</p><p>JOHN HILL is editor-in-chief of international e-magazine World-Architects.com and founder of the blog A Daily Dose of Architecture.

One of the best-known intellectual attacks against the French Revolution, Reflections is a defining tract of modern conservatism as well as an important contribution to international theory. Above all else, it has been one of the defining efforts of Edmund Burke&#39;s transformation of &#34;traditionalism into a self-conscious and fully conceived political philosophy of conservatism&#34;.</p><p>Rethinking the Western Tradition SeriesThe French Revolution is a defining moment in world history, and usually it has been first approached by English-speaking readers through the picture painted of it by Edmund Burke. Reflections on the Revolution in France is a classic work in a range of fields from history through political science to literature, and securely holds its place among the canon of &#x201c;great books.&#x201d; Yet its meaning is still contested and often misunderstood, equally by those who wish to admire or to denigrate Burke for his present-day relevance. This edition aims to locate Burke once again in his contemporary political and intellectual setting. Alone among recent versions, it reprints the text of the first edition of the Reflections, and shows how Burke amended it as his knowledge of the Revolution deepened. It is certain to become the standard edition for scholars and students alike.<br>The editor&#x2019;s Introduction is much more extensive than that of any previous edition. It situates the Reflections in Burke&#x2019;s life and the development of his ideas, the history of English political thought, the debate about the French Revolution, and the debate the book itself inspired. But the Introduction is more than a compendium of information; it is a thoughtful, coherent interpretation of Burke and his book. The editor&#x2019;s notes are also fuller than those of any previous edition, glossing many literary and biblical allusions missed by previous editors. He also supplies an extended note on the text, a biographical guide, and a bibliography, helpfully presented in discursive form.<br><br></p><h2>ELEKTRA BY FRANK MILLER OMNIBUS [NEW PRINTING]</h2><p>Elektra is a ninja, a martial arts master, and a highly paid assassin.

In determining the causes of tens of thousands of deaths, from those of presidents and rock stars to victims of serial killings, exotic sex rituals, mass disasters, child abuse and drug abuse, Baden has come to the unavoidable conclusion that the search for scientific truth is often sullied by the pressures of expediency. He produces dramatic evidence to demonstrate that political intrigue, influence peddling, and professional incompetence have created a national crisis in forensic medicine.<br>"A fascinating look into the mechanics of forensics and a disconcerting lesson in the politics of death." -- The New York Times Book Review</p><p>Forensic pathologist Michael Baden was a medical examiner in New York City for more than 25 years. Now he works for the New York State Police and teaches forensic medicine. This engrossing book covers: (1) several famous cases, including Baden&#39;s personal re-examination of the autopsy findings for Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy; (2) unusual cases Baden had as medical examiner for NYC, such as an autopsy on a dining room table at the Plaza Hotel; (3) how medical examiners decide on means of death, with a section on poisons; (4) the history of coroners and medical examiners since 12th century England; (5) disturbing politics involved in the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of NYC; (6) identification of the dead; (7) time of death; (8) multiple-murder cases; (9) an almost perfect murder; (10) close calls, including near deaths during sex; (11) cases of mistaken diagnosis; and (12) autopsy findings that shed light on what happened in the Attica uprising.Dr Michael Baden was the Chief Medical Examiner for New York City.</p><h2>The Monarchy of Fear: A Philosopher Looks at Our Political Crisis</h2><p><b>From one of the world&#x2019;s most celebrated moral philosophers comes a thorough examination of the current political crisis and recommendations for how to mend our divided country.</b><br><br>For decades Martha C. Nussbaum has been an acclaimed scholar and humanist, earning dozens of honors for her books and essays. In <i>The Monarchy of Fear</i> she turns her attention to the current political crisis that has polarized American since the 2016 election.<br> <br>Although today&#x2019;s atmosphere is marked by partisanship, divisive rhetoric, and the inability of two halves of the country to communicate with one another, Nussbaum focuses on what so many pollsters and pundits have overlooked. She sees a simple truth at the heart of the problem: the political is always emotional. Globalization has produced feelings of powerlessness in millions of people in the West. That sense of powerlessness bubbles into resentment and blame. Blame of immigrants. Blame of Muslims. Blame of other races. Blame of cultural elites. While this politics of blame is exemplified by the election of Donald Trump and the vote for Brexit, Nussbaum argues it can be found on all sides of the political spectrum, left or right.<br> <br>Drawing on a mix of historical and contemporary examples, from classical Athens to the musical Hamilton, <i>The Monarchy of Fear </i>untangles this web of feelings and provides a roadmap of where to go next.</p><p>Martha C. Nussbaum is the Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, appointed in the Philosophy Department and the Law School of the University of Chicago. She gave the 2016 Jefferson Lecture for the National Endowment for the Humanities and won the 2016 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy, which is regarded as the most prestigious award available in fields not eligible for a Nobel.

I was feeling pretty anxious about the bitterly divided electorate, and yet reasonably confident that appeals to fear and anger would be repudiated&#x2014;although there would be a lot of difficult work ahead to bring Americans together. My Japanese hosts came in and out of my hotel room, explaining the schedule of the various ceremonial events. In the background of these conversations, but in the foreground of my mind, the election news kept coming in, producing, first, increasing alarm and then, finally, both grief and a deeper fear, for the country and its people and institutions. I was aware that my fear was not balanced or fair-minded, so I was part of the problem that I worried about.<br> <br>I was in Kyoto to accept an award established by a Japanese scientist, businessman, and philanthropist&#x2014;also a Zen Buddhist priest&#x2014;who wanted to recognize &#x201c;those who have contributed significantly to the scientific, cultural, and spiritual betterment of mankind.&#x201d; While I loved the fact that Dr. Kazuo Inamori recognized philosophy as one of the disciplines capable of making a major contribution, I felt the award as more a challenge than an accolade, and was already wondering how, at this fraught moment in US history, I might actually live up to my laurels!<br> <br>By the time the election result was clear, I had to go out to have my first official meeting with the other two laureates (both scientists) at the offices of the Inamori Foundation, so I dressed up in a cheerful suit, fixed my hair, and tried to express happiness and gratitude. The first official dinner was a chore. Social conversation with strangers, filtered through an interpreter, offered no distracting charms. I wanted to hug my friends, but they were far away. Email is great, but not like a hug for comfort and consolation.<br> <br>That night the combination of political anxiety and jet lag made sleep somewhat intermittent, so I began thinking&#x2014;deciding, around midnight, that my previous work on emotions hadn&#x2019;t gone deep enough. As I examined my own fear, it gradually dawned on me that fear was the issue, a nebulous and multiform fear suffusing US society. I got some ideas, tentative but promising, about how fear is connected to, and renders toxic, other problematic emotions such as anger, disgust, and envy. I rarely work in the middle of the night. I sleep soundly, and my best ideas usually come to me gradually, sitting at my computer. But jet lag and a national crisis have a way of changing habit, and in this case, I had a joyful sense of discovery. I felt that some insight might possibly be the fruit of this upheaval&#x2014;and who knows?&#x2014;it might be insight that would give others some good ideas, too, if I could do the work well. I went back to sleep with a calming sense of hope.<br> <br>The following day&#x2014;after a cleansing morning workout&#x2014;I plunged into formal ceremony. I donned my evening dress and smiled as best I could for the official portrait photo. The onstage ceremony was aesthetically beautiful and hence distracting, and listening to the biographies of my fellow laureates and their short speeches about their work was genuinely fascinating, since they were in fields (self-driving cars and basic cancer research) about which I know little, and I was filled with admiration for their achievements. Giving my own short speech, I was able to express some of the things I really care about and to thank people who had helped me throughout my career. At least as important, I could also express love of my family and close friends. (All this had to be written in advance for the sake of the translator, so no ad hoc modification was possible, but being able to express love was still extremely consoling.)<br> <br>Kyoto prize banquets end punctually and extremely early, so by 8:30 I was back in my room, and I sat down at my desk and wrote. By that time the ideas I had had during the night had taken form, and as I wrote, they became more and more developed and more and more convincing (at least to me!). By the end of two evenings of work, I had a long blog piece that a journalist friend of mine in Australia posted, and that blog piece simultaneously took a different shape as a book proposal.<br> <br>But who am I, you might ask, and how did I come to take such a keen interest in the emotions of political unity and division? I am, of course, an academic, living a highly privileged life in the midst of wonderful colleagues and students, and with all the support I could wish for my work. Even at this time of grave threat for the humanities and the arts, my own university still strongly supports the humanities. As a philosopher without a law degree, I have the great delight of serving partly in a law school, where I can learn every day about the political and legal issues of this nation, meanwhile offering courses about justice and political ideas. So, it&#x2019;s a fine vantage point, but it might seem too detached to participate in the anxieties of most Americans.<br> <br>I was a privileged child, too, but in a far more complicated way. My family, living on Philadelphia&#x2019;s elite Main Line, was upper middle-class and fairly affluent. I had love, excellent nutrition and health care, a first-rate education at an excellent private school for women, which in those days supplied incentives to excellence, free of gendered peer pressure, that a public-school education would have offered to girls only more unevenly. (My mother used to tell me, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk so much, or the boys won&#x2019;t like you,&#x201d; apt advice for the times, but I didn&#x2019;t have to worry about following it at school!) I&#x2019;ve always loved reading, writing, and constructing arguments. Furthermore, my father loved my aspirations and supported them. A working-class man from Macon, Georgia, he had worked his way up to a partnership in a leading Philadelphia law firm by dint of ability and hard work, and he thought and said that this American Dream was available to all. That credo planted seeds of doubt. He repeatedly said that African Americans failed to succeed in America because they just didn&#x2019;t work hard enough; and yet, observing his own visceral racism, as he made household help use a separate bathroom, and even threatened to disinherit me if I appeared in public in a large group (a theater troupe) one member of which was African American, I saw that his credo did not make sense of the situation of African Americans, held down and insulted by stigma and Jim Crow separation. And my father&#x2019;s disgust with minorities extended to many who plainly had (despite social obstacles) achieved success through hard work: to middle-class African Americans and middle-class Jews in particular.<br> <br>He understood that women could excel. He delighted in my success, and encouraged independence and even defiance. And yet I observed an issue there, too: for he married a woman who was working as an interior designer, and it was immediately understood that she would stop working, something that left my mother unhappy and lonely for much of her life. His attitudes were so mixed. When I was sixteen, he offered me the choice between a debutante party and a homestay abroad on the Experiment in International Living, and was thoroughly pleased that I chose the latter&#x2014;but he would never have married a woman who didn&#x2019;t choose the former. He did think that wearing daring fashionable clothes was (for both women and men) thoroughly compatible with intellectual aspiration and success, and the fun we had on shopping expeditions was doubled by the subversive plan that I would show up at his lecture on &#x201c;Powers of Appointment&#x201d; at the Practising Law Institute wearing a bright pink mini-suit. And yet, where did he really think all of this was heading? To what sort of family life, in particular? He encouraged me to date exactly those upwardly mobile preppy men who&#x2014;like him&#x2014;would never have wanted a working wife.<br> <br>Meanwhile, that trip abroad fed further my skepticism about my father&#x2019;s credo. I was sent to live with a family of factory workers in Swansea, South Wales, and I understood how poverty, bad nutrition, bad sanitation (no indoor plumbing), and bad health conditions (coal mining in particular, which had ruined the health of quite a few family members) robbed people not only of flourishing lives but also of desire and effort. My teenage pals in that family did not want to go to school or to excel by hard work. Like the working-class British families relentlessly studied in Michael Apted&#x2019;s &#x201c;7 Up&#x201d; and its sequels, they envisaged for themselves no rosier future than the lives of their parents, and their greatest pleasure was to go drinking and to visit the legal gambling casinos nearby. I remember lying in bed reading an elite British novel&#x2014;in that house with an outhouse in the garden&#x2014;and thinking about why Eirwen Jones, my own age, hadn&#x2019;t the slightest interest in reading and writing, or even in learning Welsh. The obstacles imposed by poverty often lie deep in the human spirit, and many deprived people can&#x2019;t follow my father&#x2019;s path. (By his own account, he was well nourished, given a lot of love, inspiration, and good health care, and somehow got a first-rate education. He didn&#x2019;t notice how being white gave him huge advantages. Born in 1901, he also lived in a world of greater upward mobility than is now the case, even for poor white people.) So, I saw myself in a new perspective, as not just a very smart kid but as the product of social forces that are unequally distributed. It wasn&#x2019;t surprising that much later I deepened this understanding through work in an international development institute and by a deep partnership with development groups working for women&#x2019;s education and legal rights in India.<br> <br>Like most of the people I knew in Bryn Mawr, I was at that time a Republican, and I admired the libertarian ideas of Barry Goldwater. I still believe Goldwater was an honorable man and totally committed to the eradication of racial segregation&#x2014;he had in fact boldly integrated his family business. I think he really believed that people should choose to be just and should respect and help one another, only without government coercion. But when I began working for his campaign while still in high school, I discovered that most of my fellow Goldwaterites were not high-minded but deeply racist, supporting libertarianism as a screen for segregationist views. The ugliness of white supremacist politics repelled me, convincing me that Goldwater was na�ve and that only the force of law would finally break the grip of Jim Crow. I also understood by then (after that homestay in Swansea) that real equality requires equal access to nutrition and health care. I began to embrace the political ideals of the New Deal, while my father protested to my school that my history teachers had &#x201c;brainwashed&#x201d; me&#x2014;not the only time he underestimated the independence he had proudly nourished.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve mentioned the theater, and early in my life the arts, especially theater and music, became my window onto a more inclusive world. First of all, it was a world that encouraged the expression of powerful emotions, unlike the WASP culture of Bryn Mawr. All my teachers encouraged my mind, but the drama teacher encouraged my whole personality. I decided that I wanted to be a professional actress. I did summer stock for two seasons, left Wellesley College after three semesters to take a professional job in a repertory company, and pursued acting at what is now the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU (New York University)&#x2014;until I understood that I was not a very good actress, that the life was too unstable, and that my real passion was thinking and writing about the plays. But I still act and sing as an amateur (I&#x2019;m better, having had real-life experience), and it brings me joy. I also urge my colleagues to act (in plays connected to our law-literature conferences). I&#x2019;ve found that sharing emotions with one&#x2019;s colleagues humanizes the law school and enriches intellectual friendship.<br> <br>It was in the theater that I first encountered people who were openly gay. Indeed, I had a big crush on one such actor at the age of seventeen, and observed his life with the keen sympathy of disappointed infatuation, seeing how he had a life partner who visited him and with whom he had exchanged high school rings, but that they were openly together only in the world of the theater, not in the larger society. This seemed to me utterly absurd and irrational. He was certainly much nicer than most of the boys I knew, more understanding and respectful. I guess by that time I understood the ugly self-interest behind racism and sexism, but discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, previously hidden from me as were the phenomena, was another appalling American vice I then added to my list.<br> <br>After deciding not to become a professional actress, I returned to the academic side of NYU, where I thrived. And soon after that I met my future husband, got engaged, and converted to Judaism. I was and am attracted to the primacy of social justice in Judaism. And I have always loved the Jewish culture I joined, finding it more emotionally expressive and more openly argumentative than WASP culture. As one of my Jewish colleagues (highly successful) said of his own history in &#x201c;white-shoe&#x201d; law firms, WASP lawyers would never criticize you, just fire you suddenly after five years, whereas Jewish lawyers would yell and jump up and down, but in the end, treat you pretty fairly. Though no longer married, I&#x2019;ve kept my Jewish name and my Jewish religion, and am more involved in the life of my congregation than I was back then. (With the middle initial C, I honor my birth name, Craven.) So that meant that I joined one of the groups my father despised, and he did not come to my wedding, although my mother helped organize it. (By that time my parents were divorced.)<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve had a charmed life in some respects, then, but early on I gradually learned to see it as privileged and to ponder the exclusions of others. One form of discrimination I did not avoid was discrimination against women, which played a major role in my early career (though I had a lot of encouragement, too), and which probably explained my not getting tenure at Harvard&#x2014;although in a narrow decision, and with two departments split, any number of things could be brought forward to explain the result. And, like most working women of my generation, I&#x2019;ve experienced the problems of reconstructing family life around expectations that were new and not yet fully explored. Even when both parties have the best intentions, male expectations of an earlier era are hard to live down in the heart, particularly when there are children. And sometimes two people who love one another just cannot manage to live together. But I certainly don&#x2019;t regret plunging in. My daughter, now a lawyer working for the rights of wild animals at Friends of Animals in Denver, is among the great joys of my life. (Her lovely and supportive husband, who was imprisoned in East Germany for three years, at the age of eighteen, for putting up one political poster criticizing Communism, has shown me the perspective of an immigrant, one who loves the United States, with its freedoms and its tradition of welcome and inclusion.)<br> <br>Academics can be too detached from human realities to do good work about the texture of human life. That&#x2019;s a risk inherent in academic freedom and ten...</p><h2>Food Truck Road Trip--A Cookbook: More Than 100 Recipes Collected from the Best Street Food Vendors Coast to Coast</h2><p><p>Authentic Food Recipes From the Best Food Trucks Across the Country</p><p>Kim, Phil and Terri traveled from state to state, visiting the best food trucks out there to get the incredible and authentic recipes that make their trucks some of the most popular in the country.

You may have amazing ideas about how to improve the world, but if you aren&#x2019;t able to communicate these ideas well, they simply won&#x2019;t become reality. In <i>Public Policy Writing That Matters</i>, communications specialist David Chrisinger argues that public policy writing is most persuasive when it tells clear, concrete stories about people doing things. Combining helpful hints and cautionary tales with writing exercises and excerpts from sample policy documents, Chrisinger teaches readers to craft concise, story-driven pieces that exceed the stylistic requirements and limitations of traditional policy writing.</p><p>Too often, public policy writing is convoluted, opaque, and exclusive. Chrisinger, who teaches introductory policy writing courses around the country, offers a step-by-step guide for anyone interested in planning, organizing, developing, writing, and revising accessible public policy. From the most effective use of data visualization, the best way to write a sentence, and the ideal moment to add a compelling anecdote to advice on using facts to strengthen an argument, this little book, inspired by Strunk &amp; White&#x2019;s classic style guide, will allow anyone crafting public policy to make a bigger impact. Aimed at helping students and professionals overcome their default impulses to merely "explain," this book reveals proven, classroom-tested tips for writing sophisticated policy that is also easy to understand. </p><p>This practical, concise handbook will not only aid students throughout graduate school but will also remain a reference to consult throughout their professional careers.

In the first broad treatment of honey bee biology to appear in decades, Mark Winston provides rare access to the world of this extraordinary insect.</p><p>In a bright and engaging style, Winston probes the dynamics of the honey bee&#x2019;s social organization. He recreates for us the complex infrastructure of the nest, describes the highly specialized behavior of workers, queens, and drones, and examines in detail the remarkable ability of the honey bee colony to regulate its functions according to events within and outside the nest. Winston integrates into his discussion the results of recent studies, bringing into sharp focus topics of current bee research. These include the exquisite architecture of the nest and its relation to bee physiology; the intricate division of labor and the relevance of a temporal caste structure to efficient functioning of the colony; and, finally, the life-death struggles of swarming, supersedure, and mating that mark the reproductive cycle of the honey bee.</p><p><i>The Biology of the Honey Bee</i> not only reviews the basic aspects of social behavior, ecology, anatomy, physiology, and genetics, it also summarizes major controversies in contemporary honey bee research, such as the importance of kin recognition in the evolution of social behavior and the role of the well-known dance language in honey bee communication. Thorough, well-illustrated, and lucidly written, this book will for many years be a valuable resource for scholars, students, and beekeepers alike.</p></p><p>Mark L.

Far and away the largest number of these nurses come from the Philippines. Why is it that a developing nation with a comparatively greater need for trained medical professionals sends so many of its nurses to work in wealthier countries? Catherine Ceniza Choy engages this question through an examination of the unique relationship between the professionalization of nursing and the twentieth-century migration of Filipinos to the United States. The first book-length study of the history of Filipino nurses in the United States, <i>Empire of Care</i> brings to the fore the complicated connections among nursing, American colonialism, and the racialization of Filipinos<i>.<p></p></i><p><i></i>Choy conducted extensive interviews with Filipino nurses in New York City and spoke with leading Filipino nurses across the United States. She combines their perspectives with various others&#x2014;including those of Philippine and American government and health officials&#x2014;to demonstrate how the desire of Filipino nurses to migrate abroad cannot be reduced to economic logic, but must instead be understood as a fundamentally transnational process. She argues that the origins of Filipino nurse migrations do not lie in the Philippines' independence in 1946 or the relaxation of U.S. immigration rules in 1965, but rather in the creation of an Americanized hospital training system during the period of early-twentieth-century colonial rule. Choy challenges celebratory narratives regarding professional migrants&#x2019; mobility by analyzing the scapegoating of Filipino nurses during difficult political times, the absence of professional solidarity between Filipino and American nurses, and the exploitation of foreign-trained nurses through temporary work visas. She shows how the culture of American imperialism persists today, continuing to shape the reception of Filipino nurses in the United States. </p><p></p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Empire of Care&#34; is an extremely important work, a milestone in Asian American and American studies, and a singular contribution to the emergent field of Filipino American studies.&#34;--Vicente L.

What is an assemblage? What is a rhizome? What is a war machine? What is a body without organs? What is becoming-animal? Brent Adkins demonstrates that all the questions raised by <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> are in service to Deleuze and Guattari's radical reconstruction of the methods and aims of philosophy itself.<br><br>To achieve this he argues that the crucial term for understanding <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> is 'assemblage.' An assemblage is Deleuze and Guattari's answer to the perennial philosophical question, "What is a thing?" and they assert that assemblages are always found on a continuum between stasis and change. Each plateau is therefore concerned with a particular type of assemblage (e.g. social, political, linguistic) and its tendencies toward both stasis and change.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brent Adkins</strong> is Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Roanoke College.<br></p><h2>Eyewitness to America: 500 Years of American History in the Words of Those Who Saw It Happen</h2><p>Thomas Jefferson complains about haggling over the Declaration of Independence ...

Now, for the first time, L. Michael White, one of the world's foremost scholars on the origins of Christianity, provides the complete, astonishing story of how Christianity grew from the personal vision of a humble Jewish peasant living in a remote province of the Roman Empire into the largest organized religion in the world.</p><p>Many take for granted that the New Testament is a single book representing God's coherent, unwavering word on Jesus and his church. A closer reading reveals not one story, but many. The New Testament is a collection of books -- the result of a variety of influences on a number of faithful but very human visionaries, preachers, and storytellers. The texts contain a wealth of biographies, histories, novels, letters, sermons, hymns, church manuals, and apocalypses, providing a spectrum of views of Jesus, his message, and his movement.</p><p>Given this diversity of people, stories, and drastically different points of view, how did Christianity ever become what we know it as today? White draws on the most current scholarship to bring alive these ancient people and their debates, showing in depth how their stories were formed into what the world has come to know as the New Testament.</p><p>Rather than reading the New Testament straight through in its traditional order -- Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and so on -- White takes a historical approach, looking at the individual books in the sequence in which they were actually written. He explores what these books divulge about the disagreements, shared values, and unifying mission of the earliest Christian communities. White digs through layers of archaeological excavations, sifts through buried fragments of largely unknown texts, and examines historical sources to discover what we can know of Jesus and his early followers.</p><p>It is this early, hidden history that shaped Christianity as it grew from an errant, messianic movement to a state religion and then into a world religion that has lasted for over two thousand years. White shows how the early debates spurred the evolution of Christianity as we know it. He delves into the arguments over how to understand Jesus as both human and divine, the role of women in the church, the diversity of beliefs among Christian communities, the Gnostic influences, and the political disputes that raged over which books would ultimately be included in the New Testament. Complete with illustrations, photos, charts, and maps,&nbsp;<em>From Jesus to Christianity</em>&nbsp;presents the fullest picture yet of the beginnings of what became the most popular religion on earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>L. Michael White is Ronald Nelson Smith Chair in Classics and Christian Origins and the director of the Institute for the Study of Antiquity and Christian Origins at the University of Texas at Austin. He is the author of <em>From Jesus to Christianity</em> and has been featured in and co-written two award-winning PBS <em>Frontline</em> documentaries.</p>Joining an already distinguished lineup of narrators of early Christianity that includes Bart Ehrman, John Dominic Crossan and Gregory Riley, White contributes this rather predictable and pedantic story of the ways in which early Christianity developed its religious identity and its literature (the New Testament). White, who teaches Christian origins at the University of Texas at Austin and who co-wrote the PBS special <i>From Jesus to Christ</i>, chronicles the evolution of early Christianity as a family history. The first "generation" (30&#x2013;70 C.E.) saw the death of Jesus, the rise of Paul and the end of the Jewish revolt against Rome. In the second (70&#x2013;110 C.E.), tensions developed between the Jesus sect and Judaism, a separation that became permanent in the third generation (110&#x2013;150 C.E.), when Jesus' followers broke away from their Jewish roots and began to develop their own institutional identity and intrareligious squabbles. Finally, by the fourth generation (150&#x2013;190 C.E.), Christianity had assumed an integral role in the social and intellectual context of the Roman Empire. White uses sidebars to provide helpful summaries of the authorship, provenance, date and themes of various writings and to offer useful lists of further readings. However, his bland presentation uncovers nothing especially new in the story of early Christianity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Being contemplative refers to what is sacredly obscure or secret, something that is remote from human comprehension. It reflects the search for a deeper spiritual life, for fellowship and oneness with the omniscient, omnipotent God who is also our Father.<br> Guyon wrote from the depth of her own spiritual experiences. Growing up in France during the decadent times of Louis XIV, she was devout at an early age, but was then caught up in the worldliness around her. After an arranged marriage at age fifteen, she became increasingly interested in spiritual things; and, for the rest of her life, she continued to seek God diligently, teach others, and write books on Christian devotion. These books have become Christian classics.<br> Guyon paid a heavy price for her views and her writings. Throughout her life, she underwent various trials, including persecution and imprisonment for her beliefs. Her commentary on Song of Songs was used to sentence her to prison.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Madeleine L&#39;Engle: The Wrinkle in Time Quartet (LOA #309): A Wrinkle in Time / A Wind in the Door / A Swiftly Tilting Planet / Many Waters (Library of America Madeleine L&#39;Engle Edition)</h2><p><b><i>A Wrinkle in Time </i>was only the beginning: rediscover an American classic and its three sequels in this deluxe Library of America edition.</b><br><br>This Library of America volume presents Madeleine L'Engle's iconic classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, one of the most beloved and influential novels for young readers ever written, in a newly-prepared authoritative text and, as a special feature, it includes never-before-seen deleted passages from the novel in an appendix.

Inspiring and practical, the Discourses provide an ever-fresh framework of spiritual perspective on the challenges of everyday life. As Meher Baba stated, "Words that proceed from the Source of Truth have real meaning." <b>The Discourses</b> bear eloquent testimony to that fact and will remain an incomparable companion for those seeking spiritual direction.</p><p>Meher Baba&#39;s Discourses throw the light of true knowledge on many of life&#39;s most perplexing problems. Inspiring and practical, the Discourses provides an ever-fresh framework of spiritual perspective on the challenges of everyday life. As Meher Baba said, &#34;Words that proceed from the Source of Truth have real meaning.&#34; Discourses bears eloquent testimony to that fact and after 50 years in print remains an incomparable companion for anyone seeking spiritual direction.(1894-1969) Merwan Sheriar Irani known as Meher Baba, was born in Pune, India, on February 25, 1894, of Persian parents. His father, Sheriar Irani, was of Zoroastrian faith and a true seeker of God. Merwan went to a Christian high school in Pune and later attended Deccan College. In 1913 while still in college, a momentous event occurred in his life...the meeting with Hazrat Babajan, an ancient Mohammedan woman and one of the five Perfect Masters of the Age. Babajan gave him God-Realization and made him aware of his high spiritual destiny. <p>Eventually he was drawn to seek out another Perfect Master, Upasni Maharaj, a Hindu who lived in Sakori. During the next seven years Maharaj gave Merwan "Gnosis" or Divine Knowledge. Thus Merwan attained spiritual Perfection. His spiritual mission began in 1921 when he drew together his first close disciples. It was these early disciples who gave him the name Meher Baba, which means "Compassionate Father". </p><p>After years of intensive training of his disciples, Meher Baba established a colony near Ahmednagar that is called Meherabad. Here the Master's work embraced a free school where spiritual training was stressed, a free hospital and dispensary, and shelters for the poor. No distinction was made between the high castes and Untouchables; all mingled in common fellowship through the inspiration of the Master. To his disciples at Meherabad, who were of different castes and creeds, he gave a training of moral discipline, love for God, spiritual understanding and selfless service. </p><p>Meher Baba told his disciples that from July 10, 1925 he would observe Silence. Since that day he maintained his Silence until his death in 1969. His many spiritual discourses and messages have been dictated by means of an alphabet board. Much later the Master discontinued the use of the board and reduced all communication to hand gestures unique in expressiveness and understandable to many. </p><p>Meher Baba has traveled to the Western world six times, first in 1931, when he contacted his early Western disciples. His last visit to American was in 1958 when he and his disciples stayed at the Center established for his work at Myrtle Beach, S.C. </p><p>In India as many as one hundred thousand people have come in one day to seek his Darshan, or blessing; from all over the world there are those who journey to spend a few days, even a single day, in his presence. </p><p>An important part of Meher Baba's work through the years has been to personally contact and to serve hundreds of those known in India as "masts". These are advanced pilgrims on the spiritual path who have become spiritually intoxicated from direct awareness of God. For this work he has traveled many thousands of miles to remote places throughout India and Ceylon. Other vital work has been the washing of the lepers, the washing of the feet of thousands of poor and the distribution of grain and cloth to the destitute. </p><p>Meher Baba asserts that he is the same Ancient One, come again to redeem man from his bondage of ignorance and to guide him to realize his true Self which is God. Meher Baba is acknowledged by his many followers all over the world as the Avatar of the Age.</p></p><h2>Sleep, Pray, Heal: A Path to Wholeness &amp; Well-Being (Healing Memoir)</h2><p>How one woman recovered&#x2014;and found new ways to thrive&#x2014;after a devastating accident caused a traumatic brain injury is the core of an inspirational new memoir. Sleep, Pray, Heal: A Path to Wholeness and Well-Being has just placed as a finalist in the William Faulkner&#x2014;William Wisdom Creative Writing Competition in the category of Narrative Nonfiction Book. A chapter also placed as a top 10 winner in the Writer's Digest 2019 Competition in the area of Inspirational/Spiritual. Sleep, Pray, Heal is a story of how hard work, artistic expression, and, most of all, deep faith enabled United Methodist minister Donna Fado Ivery to reclaim her life and to offer her story to illuminate the path for others.When a two hundred pound glass partition fell on Donna Fado Ivery's head resulting in brain injury, disability, and chronic pain, she could no longer count on walking, speaking, or thinking. How would she care for her infant, her preschooler, her husband, and herself? How would she continue to serve as pastor? With humor and humility, this inspirational memoir speaks to Donna&#x2019;s struggle through medical, social, and church prejudice with the abiding support of family and the Holy Spirit. Sleep, Pray, Heal: A Path to Wholeness and Well-Being charts the path through hardship and despair and offers a map&#x2014;through scripture, prayer, poetry, painting, and storytelling&#x2014; to recovery, well-being, and a deeper faith. Sleep, Pray, Heal speaks to any audience about the ways that people in chronic pain can find healing, and suggests secular as well as faith-based resources that can help with that process. Most of all, Sleep, Pray, Heal is a warm, surprisingly humorous, and insightful personal memoir that can enlighten the mind and lighten the heart of any reader.</p><p>DONNA FADO IVERY is an artist, spiritual leader, inspirational speaker, teacher and writer.

He called his opponents derogatory, racist names. He legitimized slavery and silenced women. He was a moralistic, homophobic killjoy who imposed his narrow religious views on others. Or was he? Randolph Richards and Brandon O'Brien explore the complicated persona and teachings of the apostle Paul. Unpacking his personal history and cultural context, they show how Paul both offended Roman perspectives and scandalized Jewish sensibilities. His vision of Christian faith was deeply disturbing to those in his day and remains so in ours. Paul behaved badly, but not just in the ways we might think. Take another look at Paul and see why this "worst of sinners" dares to say, "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ."</p><p>E. Randolph Richards (PhD, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary) is dean and professor of biblical studies in the School of Ministry at Palm Beach Atlantic University. His books include <em>Rediscovering Jesus, Rediscovering Paul, The Story of Israel</em> and <em>Paul and First-Century Letter Writing</em>."Richards and O'Brien hold a high view of Scripture. They're also quite conversant and familiar with culture and worldview of Paul, leading to ample insights and understandings of Paul's teachings. For those curious about what Paul taught and for followers of Jesus and the Bible, Richards and O'Brien are able guides. Recommended." (Neil Bartlett, Christian Market, November 2016)<br><br>"Responding to examinations of the apostle Paul that paint him as racist and sexist, Richards and O'Brien (<em>Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes</em>) admit Paul's writings can be hard to take, especially those letters ordering slaves to obey masters and women to remain silent. But the authors maintain that Paul's actions must be understood through the prism of his intended audience: the letters were addressed to certain groups of people on singular, particular occasions. . . . Lay readers taking a closer look at Paul will find this book illuminating and learn a lot about a man who played an integral role in shaping Christianity. (Publishers Weekly, Sept. 12, 2016)<br><br>"Paul spent much of his ministry under attack. Nearly two thousand years later, the arrows are still flying. Patriarchal, racist, braggadocious, mercurial, the dark genius who corrupted the pure message of Jesus&#x2015;he's been accused of it all. Even Christians have a tendency to look askance at the brash apostle when his words grate on our modern sensibilities. <em>Paul Behaving Badly</em> is a defense of the apostle that strikes just the right tone. Richards and O'Brien account for the understandable objections people have to Paul's writings while gently correcting misunderstandings. This learned and readable work will resonate with fans and foes of the embattled apostle and illuminate Paul's passion for the gospel and the Christ it proclaims. I can't imagine a more needed book on a more important topic." (Drew Dyck, senior editor, CTpastors.com, author of Yawning at Tigers)<br><br>"Richards and O'Brien offer the latest installment in IVP's Behaving Badly books. Unlike when God or Jesus seems to behave badly, we need not exonerate Paul of everything he did, even when it is narrated in Scripture. The stakes are higher with what he taught, however. Our authors show that Paul's teaching surpassed the quality of his peers, even if he didn't go all the way toward certain positions we might wish he held. This is an easy-to-read, judicious guide to responding to Paul's apparent misogyny, homophobia, Scripture-twisting, hypocrisy, and more. In some instances there are other credible options as well, but Richards and O'Brien always give us defensible options. Highly recommended for all who are troubled about these issues or who want to help those who are troubled about them." (Craig L. Blomberg, distinguished professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"For those who have been daunted, angered, confused, or shocked by the apostle Paul, this fine, honest, lucid book by Richards and O'Brien helps readers better understand Paul in his own first-century setting. The authors do not fully exonerate Paul (he too was finite and sinful), nor do they engage in chronological snobbery, as many of Paul's critics are wont to do ('It's a good thing we moderns know better than Paul'). <em>Paul Behaving Badly</em> gives a fresh glimpse into the life and thought of the controversial apostle&#x2015;one that is both fair minded and charitable, at once challenging to staid assumptions while faithful to Christian orthodoxy." (Paul Copan, professor and Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics, Palm Beach Atlantic University, West Palm Beach, Florida)<br><br>"In <em>Paul Behaving Badly</em>, Richards and O'Brien take up modern charges of racism, sexism, bigotry, and hypocrisy against the apostle Paul. With humility, candor, and not a little wit, these authors present well-reasoned judgments about the apostle's character, ministry, and teachings. As trustworthy guides, Richards and O'Brien show how Paul challenges the cultural and theological issues of his day&#x2015;and our own. Readers beware: you will be uncomfortable at times, even offended, for Paul's gospel message challenges us all to reexamine our priorities and actions. A must-read for those who teach and preach on Paul, and for all who have questions about the complex apostle." (Lynn H. Cohick, professor of New Testament, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Was Paul a racist? A sexist? A homophobe? Just kind of a jerk? Modern readers are often offended by the apostle's strong words and apparently politically incorrect views. Richards and O'Brien do not sugarcoat or shy away from these issues. Instead, they dig deep into the first-century world to understand Paul on his own terms and in terms of the cultures in which he lived. The result is a deeper understanding of the radical impact of the gospel that Paul preached. This is a great book, full of clarity, nuance, and insight." (Mark L. Strauss, university professor of New Testament, Bethel Seminary, San Diego)<br><br>"Like <em>Jesus Behaving Badly</em>, this book helpfully responds to many of the misconceptions people have about a key figure in the forming of our faith. In easy-to-understand and engaging language, it explores how Paul related to the setting in which he lived and wrote." (Craig S. Keener, F. M. and Ada Thompson Professor of Biblical Studies, Asbury Seminary)<br><br>"I often hear people say, 'The apostle Paul was a sexist, homophobic bigot, so who cares what he thinks?' Well, Randy Richards and Brandon O'Brien care what he thinks, and they want to make sure that we get a proper picture of Paul, warts and all! They show that while Paul is much maligned, he is little understood, and they act like an attorney cross-examining the controversial apostle on scintillating topics like slavery, women, and homosexuality to get to the bottom of the issues. This is an honest grappling with one of the most controversial figures of Western religious history. Whether you love Paul or despise him, you'll never see him the same way again after reading this book!" (Michael F. Bird, lecturer in theology, Ridley College, Melbourne)<br><br>"Accessible, informative, and concise, this book is for those new to the study of Christianity or religion in general." (P. K.

Of course Stan could have just blurted out to his readers that he was about to be forty and realized many of his dreams remained unfulfilled. But that would be the direct approach. In life, directness is good. In writing, not so good. It&#x2019;s said that when Henry James received a manuscript he didn&#x2019;t like, he&#x2019;d return it with the dry comment, &#x201c;You have chosen a good subject and are treating it in a straightforward manner.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>You can&#x2019;t just come out and say what you have to say. That&#x2019;s what people do on airplanes, when a man plops down next to you in the aisle seat of your flight to New York, spills peanuts all over the place (back when the cheapskate airlines at least gave you peanuts), and tells you about what his boss did to him the day before. You know how your eyes glaze over when you hear a story like that? That&#x2019;s because of the way he&#x2019;s telling his story. You need a <i>good way</i> to tell your story.<br>&nbsp;<br>An <i>angle</i> is a way to tell a story. It is to the essay what a premise is to a book, or a handle is to advertising, or a high concept is to a movie (dinosaurs brought back to life for a theme park!). It&#x2019;s a gimmick or twist or conceit that grabs the reader&#x2019;s attention long enough for you to say what you want to say. Think of the angle as the Christmas tree. Once you have that six-foot pine standing up next to the piano, it&#x2019;s pretty easy to see where the decorations go. Without the tree, what have you got? A lot of pretty balls on the floor. <br>&nbsp;<br>Remember Stan, who had a big birthday coming up? He needed a new way to take stock of his accomplishments when he turned forty. The first few lines establish the angle in Stan&#x2019;s humorous twist on the subject:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Listen, I can&#x2019;t spend a lot of time on today&#x2019;s column because there&#x2019;s a lot I have to do. See, today&#x2019;s the last day I&#x2019;m thirty-nine years old, and there&#x2019;re all these things I always wanted to accomplish before I turned forty. Like get married. Always wanted to be married before I turned forty.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Stan&#x2019;s angle was that he had to realize all his dreams on that final day of being thirty-nine. No problem with the marriage thing (&#x201c;I&#x2019;d had my eye on this woman who came into the health club most mornings at eleven&#x201d;), but he also had to write a novel (&#x201c;Fortunately, I have a couple of ideas&#x201d;), and acquire kids, a house, a horse, and a piano. He was going to have a busy day. <br>&nbsp;<br>Angles are half the battle, so when you find one it&#x2019;s often almost not an exaggeration to say you are practically done, except for the typing. Stand up, stretch, and go eat the leftover chicken in the fridge. Angles make the rest of the piece easy, because often what follows is the easiest thing in the world to write: a list. You just have to come up with your points and pick an order for them. Notice that Stan&#x2019;s account of all the things he needed to do before turning forty is such a list: he could start with the piano, and then talk about kids, and the piece would still work. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>You Have a Subject&#x2014;But Do You Have an Angle?</b><br>When a writer talks about having an idea for a piece, he usually means not that he has found a subject to write about, but that he has found an angle. When I wanted to write about mothers and their middle-aged daughters for <i>MORE</i> magazine, I had a <i>subject</i>. When I proposed a piece about how daughters start to take it easy on their mothers in middle age, I had an <i>angle</i>. Even when an essay is a chronological narrative&#x2014;here&#x2019;s my story of life as a black woman in America&#x2014;finding an angle will sharpen it, as Zora Neale Hurston did when she began, &#x201c;I remember the very day that I became colored.&#x201d; Note the surprise in that statement: People don&#x2019;t become colored; they discover they are. An angle always has an element of surprise&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the thing that makes it new. <br>&nbsp;<br>Once I assigned a class to write about the same subject: Barbie dolls. Everybody returned with a different angle. One woman said <i>she</i> was a Barbie doll, another talked about how the pressure of keeping Barbie well dressed turned her into a shoplifter, a man said he pretended to hate Barbie&#x2014;burning her hair off over the gas jets&#x2014;but was more drawn to her than he let on. A student named Lisa Pongrace found her angle in a remark she happened to make in her first draft: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Barbie is regarded to be the standard of feminine perfection, yet Barbie isn&#x2019;t perfect at all-her arms don&#x2019;t even bend! She carries out a tray of frosty beverages, balancing it on the two bamboo poles they&#x2019;ve given her for arms. She can&#x2019;t even curl her fingers.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Like the outline of a narrative essay, the angle lets you know what to put in, what to leave out. Now that Lisa knows that her piece will be on Barbie&#x2019;s imperfections, she will focus the next draft on that. If she talks about Barbie&#x2019;s stunning array of careers, for example, she might observe that a flighty resume hardly demonstrates seriousness of purpose. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>using conflict as angle</b><br>Sometimes your angle is bringing conflict into the piece when it needs it. It&#x2019;s not enough to write a piece about how much you like to spend the day in bed. You always have to tell us what&#x2019;s stopping you, or the piece will lack tension and thus have the gripping quality of a Hallmark card.<br>&nbsp;<br>Often, of course, there is no trouble. The trip was wonderful in every respect, the new boyfriend is heaven sent, you are floating in a sky-blue pool in a Caribbean resort, and your only source of distress is that the tiny umbrella from your drink fell in the water. <br>&nbsp;<br>One fix is to bring into the piece something or somebody who&#x2019;s preventing you from doing what you want to do. If I want to write about how I nervously arrive hours early for a flight, maybe even get a hotel room at the airport the night before just to make sure, I have a topic, but where&#x2019;s the tension? Who cares when I like to get to the airport? So I bring in someone with the opposite point of view&#x2014;in this case, my husband, Bill, who prefers that last-minute swan dive into the 747 as it pulls away from the gate. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is why, incidentally, columnists always cast their partners in the straight man role&#x2014;to be the &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that&#x201d; obstacle. You can use the same technique. Bring in a friend, a boss, or a mother (mothers are fabulous for this)&nbsp;to oppose you. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>How to Find an Angle</b><br>If you&#x2019;re struggling to come up with a compelling angle, here are some techniques and resources to try out. An interesting angle can come from any of the following sources.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>the daily paper </b><br>I collect newspaper clippings that offer promising angles. One is a Miss Manners column with the headline, &#x201c;A Move to Abolish the High School Prom.&#x201d; For anyone wanting to write the story of her own high school prom, there&#x2019;s an angle right there. Who cares if everybody has a terrible time at the prom? We had to go through it, and the next generation should have to, too.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>something you hear yourself say aloud</b><br>I was having Thai food with my friend John when I remarked to him that my husband, Bill, and I kept all our finances separate. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t even have a joint banking account.&#x201d; My friend stared as if I had lifted a door in my skin and revealed a howling wilderness where sunshine and a lawn should be. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t sound romantic, but it is,&#x201d; I rushed to assure him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve practically never had an argument about money.&#x201d; When I heard myself saying that, I jotted the idea on my napkin: &#x201c;Divvying up finances like college roommates can be romantic.&#x201d; That statement contains surprise, so it makes a promising angle.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>talking the piece through with someone </b><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure where to start, I seem to have two separate problems, the ending seems weak, what the hell is my epiphany?&#x201d; and so on. If you don&#x2019;t have a writing partner, follow that other human you live with around the house. &#x201c;See, I&#x2019;m trying to write about the plane crash that killed my whole skating team after I missed the flight, and I never understood . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Your housemate can yawn, or keep folding the towels, shaving, or even watching TV&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s what you hear yourself saying that does the trick. A few years ago I&#x2019;d been trying to find a way to write about a dark painting my mother made that showed my six siblings and me at the swimming hole in Samuel P. Taylor Park in Northern California, near where I grew up. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She painted in all the shadows,&#x201d; I commented to my husband, Bill, as I hung the painting in the hall, &#x201c;but I remember all the sunlight.&#x201d; <i>Bingo</i>. Angle. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>writing the last paragraph </b><br>You can sometimes coax out an angle by writing a final paragraph, an exercise that&#x2019;s just to help you think. I do this often. In this paragraph you type, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m trying to say here. What am I saying about my high school reunion? Am I trying to say this? Or that?&#x201d; Just as when you talk a piece through with someone, if you force yourself to focus on what you&#x2019;re driving at, you find you know&#x2014;or your typing fingers do. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>a remark you made in an early draft </b><br>A student of mine set down some thoughts about being confined to an apartment in Iran with her sister one long summer when their father was on assignment there. When she wrote, &#x201c;The closer we were kept together, the more we grew apart,&#x201d; she had her angle. <br>&nbsp;<br>Similarly, my former writing partner, Ginny McReynolds, a college dean, said in a piece about lesbian potlucks, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like so many other things in the lesbian community. For many lesbians, putting a lot of energy into something that is traditionally female seems wrong.&#x201d; Angle! If she used that angle throughout the essay, she&#x2019;d talk about the potluck, but also add other examples of lesbians balking at makeup or housekeeping or fancy clothes.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>a quote </b><br>I read a magazine piece in which the writer muses, &#x201c;I wonder: Do health concerns simply represent a more mature way of hating your body?&#x201d; That&#x2019;d be a good angle on the current obsession with health. Or, if you are just moving in with someone, you could play with a remark Robert Kaplan, a psychologist practicing in Oakland, made: the amount of our furniture we bring with us represents how much of our past we&#x2019;re willing to give up on, share, or ignore. <br>&nbsp;<br>I read somewhere about a mother with a sick baby who says at one point, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all very hard, but there&#x2019;s a lot of collateral beauty along the way.&#x201d; That would be a good angle for a piece, as would this line from Salman Rushdie&#x2019;s book, <i>The Moor&#x2019;s Last Sigh</i>: &#x201c;Every child creates the father she needs.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>I found an angle for a piece about the messy apartment I shared with my kids when I read the following quote, attributed to Herbert Muschamp, in <i>HG Magazine</i>: &#x201c;We want a place for everything, but not necessarily everything in its place.&#x201d; My piece began, &#x201c;The upended picnic cooler serving as a fourth chair in my kitchen illuminated what Herbert Muschamp must have meant when he said . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br><b>surprising remarks you hear</b><br>I once heard a woman say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got four sisters and am always amazed that I&#x2019;m the only one who remembers all family events exactly as they happened.&#x201d; Another woman I know, referring to a crooked curtain rod in her entryway, commented, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the kind of thing it takes a year and fifteen minutes to do.&#x201d; Both of those are good possible angles. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>How to Use Setup </b><br><i>Setup</i> can be another effective way to structure a piece and is thus a kind of angle. In setup, you begin the piece with the opposite of where you want to go. (We saw a bit of this in the last chapter, when we talked about constructing an essay by working backward from the epiphany.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#x2019;s an example of how setup works: One day <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> columnist Jon Carroll was attending a wedding reception and he realized he was boring the bride he was talking to. Naturally, any such bad moment has potential, but a major metropolitan paper doesn&#x2019;t hire people to turn out columns that say, &#x201c;I had a troubling experience the other day that I&#x2019;d like to tell you about.&#x201d; In order to write about that moment of humiliation, Jon set it up by starting with the opposite: how nice it is, as a celebrated Bay Area columnist, to be recognized and admired:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Nice wedding last weekend. Very fine pizza; always a plus at a wedding. Lovely couple. Sweet music. Chocolate wedding cake-why doesn&#x2019;t everyone think of that? Fans. I don&#x2019;t mean to be immodest, but try to stop me. I am standing there in my extremely lovely Italian suit (the kind that causes people to involuntarily finger the sleeve and say, &#x201c;I had no idea that you owned a suit like that, or at all&#x201d;), eating a nectarine and gazing benignly into the mystic . . . </i><br>&nbsp;<br>Then the fall, which appeared near the end of the column: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>I look into Shana Morrison&#x2019;s eyes. </i>[<i>The bride was Shana Morrison, the daughter of Van Morrison.</i>]<i> She is looking at me with devastating politeness. She is waiting for my rap to end. She&#x2019;s done this before-her father has a lot of really old fans with obscure enthusiasms. I am the old guy at the wedding. My face is close to hers, and I&#x2019;m sure my breath smells of whiskey and cigarettes and denture cream, though I&#x2019;ve stopped using the first two and have not yet started the third. </i><br>&nbsp;<br>Just as Jon wrote about humiliation by starting with how famous he is, Betsy Carter, in a piece in <i>Glamour</i>, wrote about hanging onto people by first talking about throwing things out. &#x201c;When in doubt, toss it. That&#x2019;s pretty much how I live my life. I have been known to throw away paychecks and dump IRS forms. The only thing I seem unable to shed is people.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>There&#x2019;s no reason for us to know Carter threw out her checks&#x2014;what do her feckless accounting methods have to do with anything? Those details are there to set up the contrast&#x2014;throwing out versus keeping&#x2014;that gives the piece its structure. Without it, you have the direct approach again: a writer tugging on your sleeve and telling you how she likes to hang on to people, from ex-husbands to dentists. <br>&nbsp;<br>Another example? Virginia Woolf began a piece called &#x201c;Professions for Women&#x201d; by talking about how easily she became a writer: &#x201c;When I came to write,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;there were very few material obstacles in my way.&#x201d; Writing was a reputable occupation, she said, the scratching of a pen disturbed no family peace, and paper was cheap. She quickly sold a piece about a Persian cat that brought her into disputes with her neighbors. &#x201c;What could be easier,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;than to write articles and to buy Persian cats with the profits?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A lot, it turns out. That was the setup. The rest of the piece lists the harsh obstacles that impeded the woman writer in her day. If she had started by saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard for a woman to become a writer,&#x201d; and t...</p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Talk about Death (over Dinner): An Invitation and Guide to Life&#39;s Most Important Conversation</h2><p><b>For readers of<i> Being Mortal</i> and <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i>, the acclaimed founder of Death over Dinner offers a practical, inspiring guide to life's most difficult yet important conversation<br><br></b> Of the many critical conversations we will all have throughout our lifetime, few are as important as the ones discussing death--and not just the practical considerations, such as DNRs and wills, but what we fear, what we hope, and how we want to be remembered. Yet few of these conversations are actually happening. Inspired by his experience with his own father and countless stories from others who regret not having these conversations, Michael Hebb cofounded Death Over Dinner--an organization that encourages people to pull up a chair, break bread, and really talk about the one thing we all have in common. Death Over Dinner has been one of the most effective end-of-life awareness campaigns to date; in just three years, it has provided the framework and inspiration for more than a hundred thousand dinners focused on having these end-of-life conversations. As Arianna Huffington said, "We are such a fast-food culture, I love the idea of making the dinner last for hours. These are the conversations that will help us to evolve."<br><br><i>Let's Talk About Death (over Dinner)</i> offers keen practical advice on how to have these same conversations--not just at the dinner table, but anywhere. There's no one right way to talk about death, but Hebb shares time- and dinner- tested prompts to use as conversation starters, ranging from the spiritual to the practical, from analytical to downright funny and surprising. By transforming the most difficult conversations into an opportunity, they become celebratory and meaningful--ways that not only can change the way we die, but the way we live.<b><br></b></p><p>Michael Hebb is the founder of Death Over Dinner, a Partner at global wellbeing organization RoundGlass and the founder of Convivium, a creative agency that specializes in the ability to shift culture through the use of thoughtful food and discourse-based gatherings.

As members of the Hitler Youth, they had once been enthusiastic supporters of the German renewal promised by National Socialism. But as their realization of Nazi barbarism grew, so did their moral outrage.Hans and Sophie formed a small group of like-minded friends, which initially included two medical students, a student of philosophy, and a fifty-year-old professor. They self-identified as Christians from various traditions--Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox--and they called themselves the White Rose. In a darkened studio lent them by an artist, they printed eloquent anti-Nazi leaflets, which they ingeniously spread throughout Germany.A Noble Treason tells the true story of this underground group at the University of Munich that instigated, organized, and carried out the first overt resistance to Hitler&#39;s regime. What gives A Noble Treason its unforgettable and inspiring quality is the personality, character, and courage of the White Rose members, as they resisted the pull of wartime patriotism and overcame their fear of the terrible price they would pay for their dissidence.The story of the White Rose is one of faith-inspired idealism in deadly conflict with ideological tyranny. Its theme is the ultimate victory of that idealism despite its bloody--and seemingly final--destruction by the state.</p><p>Richard Hanser served as a psychological warfare specialist in Europe during World War II. He was a reporter and feature writer for newspapers in Buffalo, Cleveland and New York before the war. Afterward he wrote for documentary films and authored several books."I thought I knew the story of the White Rose pretty well, but Richard Hanser provides detail, context, and insight that I have not previously encountered. <i>A Noble Treason</i> is an exciting read and a tribute worthy of the defiance and the sacrifices made by those students at the University of Munich when they were under the thumb of Hitler's minions." --<b>Ronald J. Rychlak</b>, Author, <i>Hitler, the War, and the Pope</i><br><br>"This vivid account gives witness to the true spirit of man. One can only marvel at the patience, ingenuity and determination of these students as they pit themselves against Hitler and his Third Reich. Undeterred by the price to be paid if they were caught, their story reminds us of what true courage is and of our responsibility to do what is right. . . despite the odds." --<b>Kurt von Schuschnigg</b>, Author,<i> When Hitler Took Austria</i></p><h2>Open Heart</h2><p>A profoundly and unexpectedly intimate, deeply affecting summing up of life so far, from one of the most cherished moral voices of our time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eighty-two years old, facing emergency heart surgery and his own mortality, Elie Wiesel reflects back on his life. Emotions, images, faces, and questions flash through his mind. His family before and during the unspeakable Event. The gifts of marriage, children, and grandchildren that followed. In his writing, in his teaching, in his public life, has he done enough for memory and for the survivors? His ongoing questioning of God&#x2014;where has it led? Is there hope for mankind? The world&#x2019;s tireless ambassador of tolerance and justice gives us a luminous account of hope and despair, an exploration of the love, regrets, and abiding faith of a remarkable man.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> Translated from the French by Marion Wiesel</p><p><b>ELIE WIESEL</b>&nbsp;was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.

Wiesel died in 2016.1<br><br>June 16, 2011.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your heart,&#x201d; says the gastroenterologist after performing an endoscopy on me.<br><br>I am surprised: &#x201c;Not my stomach?&#x201d;<br><br>For some time now, acid reflux has been one of my nightmares. My longtime general practitioner also feels it has contributed to the various health problems that have afflicted me for the past several years.<br><br>My wife, Marion, and I have just returned from Jerusalem, where, every year, we spend the holiday of Shavuot with close friends. In keeping with the tradition to which I have remained faithful, friends and I spent the night in a yeshiva in the Old City studying biblical and Talmudic laws and commentaries dating from the Middle Ages.<br><br>This time, in Jerusalem, it had all gone well. No terrorist attacks. No border incidents. Even my cursed migraines seemed to respect the sanctity of this night, of this city unlike any other. But now, back in New York, suddenly my body revolts. The new piercing pain in my shoulders rises all the way to my jaw. I swallow a double dose of Nexium, the medicine I take for acid reflux. This time without success.<br><br>&#x201c;No, neither the stomach nor the esophagus,&#x201d; replies the doctor after a moment of silence. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s certainly the heart.&#x201d; Ominous words, inducing fear and the promise of more pain. Or worse.<br><br>2<br><br>as soon as he receives his colleague&#x2019;s message, my primary care doctor, a cardiologist, reaches me at home. On the phone, he appears to be out of breath; he speaks in a tense, emphatic voice, louder than usual. I have the feeling that he is trying to contain or even hide his nervousness, his concern. Clearly, he is unhappy to have to give me this bad news that will change so many things for me . . .<br><br>&#x201c;I expected a different result,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;But now the situation requires some further tests immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please come to Lenox Hill Hospital right away. I am already there.&#x201d;<br><br>I protest: &#x201c;Why? Because it&#x2019;s the heart? Is it really that urgent? I have never had a problem with my heart. With my head, yes; my stomach too. And sometimes with my eyes. But the heart has left me in peace.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, he explodes: &#x201c;This conversation makes no sense. I am your cardiologist, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! Please don&#x2019;t argue with me! You must take a number of tests that can only be administered at the hospital. Come as quickly as you can! And take the emergency entrance!&#x201d;<br><br>On occasion, I can be incredibly stupid and stubborn. And so I nevertheless steal two hours to go to my office. I have things to attend to. Appointments to cancel. Letters to sign. People to see&#x2014;among others, a delegation of Iranian dissidents.<br><br>Strange, all this time I am not really worried, though by nature I am rather anxious and pessimistic. My heart does not beat faster. My breathing is normal. No pain. No premonitions. No warning. After all, hadn&#x2019;t I just three days ago gone through a complete checkup with all kinds of tests, including a cardiogram, administered by my physician, the same one who is now ordering me to the hospital? There had been no indication of a coronary problem: no chest pain or feeling of oppression. What has changed so abruptly in my body to destabilize it to this extent?<br><br>All right, I&#x2019;ll go to the hospital, since both doctors insist. I don&#x2019;t take anything along. No books, no spare shirt, no toothbrush. Marion says she wants to accompany me. I try to discourage her. In vain.<br><br>3<br><br>a team of specialists is waiting for me in the emergency room. The very first blood test instantly reveals the gravity of my condition. There is a definite risk of heart attack. The doctors exchange incomprehensible comments in their own jargon. Their conclusion is quick, unambiguous and unanimous: An immediate procedure is required. There can be no delay.<br><br>Marion whispers in my ear that we are fortunate; she has just learned that the surgeon who will perform the angiogram is the one who operated on her two years earlier. I remember him, a handsome, strikingly intelligent man. I had been struck by his kindness as much as by his competence.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope,&#x201d; he tells me, &#x201c;that we will be able to do for you what we succeeded in doing for your wife: to restore a normal flow of blood in the arteries by inserting a stent.&#x201d; But then he adds, looking grave, &#x201c;I must warn you that we may have to intervene in a more radical way. We will know very soon.&#x201d;<br><br>I am drowsy and fight against sleep by trying to follow the brief professional exchanges in the operating room. Actually, I don&#x2019;t understand a word. About an hour later, I hear the surgeon saying, &#x201c;I am so sorry, I don&#x2019;t have good news for you: Your condition is such that the insertion of a stent won&#x2019;t suffice. You have five blocked arteries. You require open-heart surgery.&#x201d;<br><br>I am shaken. Sure, I know that these days open-heart surgery is regularly performed the world over. Dr. Christiaan Barnard&#x2019;s face appears before me; I had met the famous surgeon at a conference in Haifa and we had engaged in a long dialogue on medical ethics, comparing Judaic and Christian points of view. I had looked at his hands, wondering how many human beings owed them their survival.<br><br>But now the words &#x201c;open-heart surgery&#x201d; are meant for <i>me</i>. And they fill me with dread.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky. A colleague of mine, an expert in this type of surgery, is at the hospital right now. I have spoken to him. He is ready to operate on you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doctor,&#x201d; I ask, &#x201c;have you told my wife?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but I will do it right now.&#x201d;<br><br>In a moment he is back: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen Marion. As well as your son, Elisha.&#x201d;<br><br>The fact that my beloved son is already at the hospital does not surprise me. Since his earliest childhood, he has always made me proud, always been there for me.<br><br>&#x201c;What do they think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They agree; we have no choice. But the decision is yours alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May I see them?&#x201d;<br><br>Marion and Elisha are not good at hiding their anxiety. Their smiles seem forced. And how am I to hug them without falling apart? Marion, holding back her tears, tries to reassure me: &#x201c;The doctors are optimistic. The surgeon they propose is world-renowned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It will go well,&#x201d; says Elisha. &#x201c;I know it, Dad. I am convinced of it.&#x201d;<br><br>I remain silent.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we go?&#x201d; urges the attending physician.<br><br>The nurses are ready to push the gurney toward the OR. I steal another glance at the woman with whom I have shared my life for more than forty-two years. So many events, so many discoveries and projects, unite us. All we have done in life we have accomplished together. And now, one more experience.<br><br>As the door opens, I look one last time at our son, the fine young man who has justified&#x2014;and continues to justify&#x2014;my life and who endows it with meaning and a hereafter.<br><br>Through the tears that darken the future, a thought awakens a deeper concern, a deeper sorrow: Shall I see them again?</p><h2>The Terrible Two&#39;s Last Laugh</h2><p>It&#x2019;s Miles and Niles&#x2019;s final year at Yawnee Valley Science and Letters Academy, and the Terrible Two have one goal: an epic prank.

R. Pearson&#x2019;s <em>Pasteur: Plagiarist, Imposter</em> was originally published in 1942, and is a succinct introduction to both Louis Pasteur and Antoine B�champ, and the reasons behind the troubled relationship that they shared for their entire working lives.</p><p>Whereas Pearson&#x2019;s work is a valuable introduction to an often complex topic, it is Ethel Douglas Hume&#x2019;s expansive and well-documented <em>B�champ or Pasteur? A Lost Chapter in the History of Biology</em> which provides the main body of evidence. It covers the main points of contention between B�champ and Pasteur in depth sufficient to satisfy any degree of scientific or historical scrutiny, and it contains, wherever possible, detailed references to the source material and supporting evidence.</p><p>Virtually no claim in Ms Hume&#x2019;s book is undocumented &#x2013; to have access to more material, one would need to be able to read French, and go to the original source material.</p><p>The reader will soon discern that neither Mr Pearson nor Ms Hume could ever be called fans of Pasteur or his &#x2018;science&#x2019;. They both declare their intentions openly; that they wish to contribute to the undoing of a massive medical and scientific fraud. The publication of this present edition of their work is undertaken in the same spirit.</p><p>This is the hardback edition. This title is also available in paperback and ebook formats.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing is lost, nothing is created ... all is transformed.<br> Nothing is the prey of death.<br> All is the prey of life.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013; <em>Antoine B�champ</em></p><p><strong>Reviews</strong></p><p>"It&#x2019;s strange to realize that the two parts in this book actually were printed way back, respectively in 1923 and 1942, so why has the truth about Pasteur and the vaccination been buried for so long?"</p><p>"Modern medicine needs to return to this bifurcation point and take the pleomorphic path. When this phenomenon is truly understood drugs poisons will disappear as do all things which outlive their usefulness. This book is required reading for anyone choosing to understand how the body heals."</p><p>"A very interesting look at two rivals in science.

This remarkable narrative of Daniel Duane's life on the water is enhanced by good-humored explanations of the physics of wave dynamics, the intricate art of surfboard design, and lyrical, sharp-eyed descriptions of the flora and fauna of the Pacific wilderness. From Captain Cook and Mark Twain to Robinson Jeffers and Jack London, from portraits of famous (and infamous) surfers to an analysis of Gidget's perverse significance, Duane expertly uncovers the myths and symbols bound up in one of our most vibrant and recognizably American subjects.</p></p><p>Tossing aside a mundane and meaningless job, Daniel Duane went to Santa Cruz, California, to surf for year. The book he wrote about it, <i>Caught Inside</i> is something of a <i>Walden</i> of our times. It's wonderfully written, weaving wave wisdom with literary and historical references. And it's not for surfers only: even readers who have never seen the surf will find themselves taken up in the book's rhythms. <p> Duane sought the peace that surfing offers, and his impressions of surfing characters, sea life (otters, seals, and the great white shark everyone fears is right under you as you paddle your board), and the seasons by the sea are evocative and soothing to read.</p><p><b>Daniel Duane</b> was born in 1967 and is the author of <i>Looking for Mo and Lighting Out: A Vision of California and the Mountains</i>. He lives and surfs in Santa Cruz, California.</p></p><h2>At Grave&#39;s End</h2><p><blockquote><p>Some things won't stay buried . . . at grave's end</p></blockquote><p>It <em>should</em> be the best time of half-vampire Cat Crawfield's life. With her undead lover Bones at her side, she's successfully protected mortals from the rogue undead. But though Cat's worn disguise after disguise to keep her true identity a secret from the brazen bloodsuckers, her cover's finally been blown, placing her in terrible danger.</p><p>As if that wasn't enough, a woman from Bones's past is determined to bury him once and for all. Caught in the crosshairs of a vengeful vamp, yet determined to help Bones stop a lethal magic from being unleashed, Cat's about to learn the true meaning of bad blood. And the tricks she's learned as a special agent won't help her. She will need to fully embrace her vampire instincts in order to save herself&#x2014;and Bones&#x2014;from a fate worse than the grave.</p></p><p>Jeaniene Frost is the New York Times, USA Today, and international bestselling author of the Night Huntress series and the Night Huntress World novels.

This was especially true of Martin Luther, the man regarded as the father of the Reformation.</p><p>Luther used every legitimate means to make known the truths of Scripture. His strategies included writing books, tracts, pamphlets, and letters, as well as classroom lectures, public debates, and heated disputations in churches and universities.

In this brilliant combination of biography and lucid exposition, their apocalyptic visions of the future are woven together into a provocative portrait of modernity.<br> <br>&#x201c;This small book has a depth of insight and a comprehensiveness of treatment beyond what its modesty of size and tone indicates.

Included are tales of mothers and daughters, rebels and seeresses, community activists and aging gangbangers, as well as essays on film and literature, politics and race, and on the difficulties and necessities of forging an identity as an artist, activist, and black woman. It is a treasure trove not only for those familiar with Bambara&#39;s work, but for a new generation of readers who will recognize her contribution to contemporary American letters.</p><p>Toni Cade Bambara published a novel and two collections of stories, yet before her death in December 1995, she had not published new work in 14 years. Her long silence was all the more ironic because Bambara had, in 1970, edited a ground-breaking anthology of black women's writing called <i>The Black Woman</i>. Here, Toni Morrison presents six hitherto unpublished stories and six essays, striking work that shows Bambara's view of the writer as cultural worker and her concern with politics and the empowerment of black Americans."Bambara's passion and concern for her people permeates <i>Deep Sightings and Rescue Missions</i>.... So strongly does the book convey Bambara's fiercely loving spirit that even those just making her acquaintance will feel the pain of her loss."<br>--<i>Miami Herald</i></p><h2>The Summoning (Krewe of Hunters, 27)</h2><p><strong>A CALL FROM BEYOND...</strong><br><br>When Kristi Stewart inherits a property in the old part of Savannah, she knows it comes with stories of hauntings.

Now it was summer and time to explore the jungle. </p><p> "We may find a tiger," Henry told his mother. </p><p> "Well, don't get eaten," his mother said, handing him his lunch. </p><p> It was harder exploring the jungle than Henry had thought it would be. The grass was so high he could hardly see over it, and not all of the inhabitants were friendly. </p><p> Still, explorers are brave; when they find a tiger, they know just what to do. It is such moments of triumph that make exploring worthwhile, and make reading about it almost as good.</p></p><p><p> Dr Mark Taylor is a lecturer in the School of</p><p> Business and Humanities, Institute of</p><p> Technology, Sligo.</p><p> Dr Mark Taylor is a lecturer in the School of Business and Humanities, Institute of Technology, Sligo.</p></p><h2>The Flash Vol. 10: Force Quest</h2><p><b>The Flash goes on a Force Quest!

Excerpts from real research reports are used as opportunities to develop methodological knowledge and practice analytic skills.

Readers learn all the conventions of research that people usually have to discover on their own, such as how to cite people, use APA style, and even how to list references. The book explains when and how a researcher would use both qualitative and quantitative methods, including ways to use them together. The chapter on ethnography provides one of the best descriptions of this method and its complexities that I have seen."--Ann Lieberman, EdD, Senior Scholar, Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education, Stanford University<br><br> "As a teacher educator, I am concerned that my students develop the ability to understand just what the research in their field does and does not say, and the implications for practice. This very useful text will serve that goal. It is appropriate for introductory educational research courses for both preservice and inservice education students. I appreciate that the text is designed for readers with a variety of cognitive styles, and that it uses visual representations and concept maps to explain research processes. It discusses the assumptions and methodologies employed by different research designs and provides a great understanding of the limitations of descriptive research (especially test reports) to drive policy."--Katherine K. Merseth, EdD, Senior Lecturer and Director of Teacher Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education<br> "The emphasis on research literacy is essential in training forward-thinking educators. Most students at the master's level will not be engaged in deep experimental research, but as future practitioners, they will need to understand the published research and conduct 'in-house' studies. That is where this book can serve its most important function. The discussion of sampling (often the weakest link in a research study) is very good.

In this book, his life&#x2019;s work, he interweaves his teaching experience, the knowledge he gleaned from his trip, and the history of Progressive Education. As Little and Katherine Ellison reveal, these educators and schools invigorate learning and promote inquisitiveness by allowing the curriculum to grow organically out of children's questions&#x2015;whether they lead to studying the senses, working on a farm, or re-creating a desert ecosystem in the classroom.</p><p>We see curious students draw on information across disciplines to think in imaginative yet practical ways, like in a "Mini-Maker Faire" or designing and building a chair from scratch. Becoming good citizens was another of Little's goals. He believed in the need for students to learn how to become advocates for themselves, from setting rules on the playground to engaging in issues of social justice in the wider community.</p><p>Using the philosophy of Progressive Education, schools can prepare students to shape a vibrant future in the arts and sciences for themselves and the nation.</p> 10 photographs</p><p><p><strong>Tom Little</strong> served as head of Oakland, California's Park Day School for twenty-seven years.

We don&#x2019;t have a big sign that shows people where to find us; as a matter of fact, we don&#x2019;t have any sign at all. You need to enter a security code to get inside in the morning, and set it again when you leave at night. Some people might find this unusual, having to bake under security cameras that watch you 24/7, and, truthfully, at first it <i>was</i> a bit strange for all of us in the kitchen. But now we don&#x2019;t even think about it.</p><p>I&#x2019;m Karin Lazarus, founder of Sweet Mary Jane Bakery. I&#x2019;ve been baking since I was eight, when my mom gave me a Sunbeam Mixmaster and a Betty Crocker cookbook. My mother kept our family&#x2019;s pantry stocked with all the goodies Hostess had to offer, plus what she herself baked. We ate sweet treats all the time: homemade chocolate pudding with toasted walnuts and a dollop of freshly whipped cream, Linzer cookies filled with raspberry preserves and dusted with powdered sugar, icebox cookie cake, and chocolate chip cookies baked at the drop of a hat, just because. She&#x2019;d even top homemade waffles with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and pure maple syrup. That got me out of bed in the morning! I had the biggest sweet tooth in the universe, and my mom made sure I could satisfy it. But even back then, I wanted to make things on my own.</p><p>After baking my very first batch of chocolate chip cookies, my family&#x2019;s <i>ooh</i>s and <i>ahh</i>s were such a thrill. Oh, I was hooked. I was a Girl Scout, and of course I sold Girl Scout cookies, but as I was delivering boxes to the neighbors, I fantasized about having made the cookies myself. In the summertime, while other kids set up lemonade stands, I opened a <i>cookie</i> stand. Baking, I saw, was not only fun but profitable. Best of all, it made people happy.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve aimed to do ever since.</p><p>In high school, I baked for head shops in New York City&#x2014;you know, those funky little stores that sell hippie clothing, incense and perfume (patchouli!), and drug paraphernalia. Way back then, it was uninfused goodies, things like rose petal sweet bread, banana bread, peach bread, and assorted cookies and brownies. I doubt I made enough money to cover the ingredients, but I didn&#x2019;t care; I loved doing it. I baked all through college, too, for family gatherings and also for friends. Nobody I knew ever went without a birthday cake. I made delicious treats for when the munchies struck, and took special requests for party desserts. I was thrilled that people wanted me to bake for them.</p><p>I married after graduation, and moved to New York with my husband, Charley. My degree was in photography and I immediately found work as an artists&#x2019; representative. Although I enjoyed the job (and it certainly paid the bills), it wasn&#x2019;t something I felt passionate about. I wanted a business of my own, and I knew it had to revolve around cooking. So I signed up for catering classes in Chelsea. This covered both cooking and the business end of things, and it was great fun. Living in the city, I was surrounded by wonderful restaurants and&#x2014;especially important, given my sweet tooth!&#x2014;bakeries: Dean &amp; DeLuca, Vesuvio Italian Bakery, The Silver Palate, Chelsea Market. There was a tiny Italian place across from our apartment on Sullivan Street, and I used to walk over and get the best biscotti before heading to work. During Lent, they made hot cross buns and sold them toasty warm and slathered with fresh, creamy butter, and there were lines of happy customers out the door. Owning a bakery, I thought, must be the best thing in the world.</p><p>A few years later, my husband and I moved to Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. White sand, hot sun, the beautiful sea. Charley worked as a builder while I kept busy with private catering jobs, parties for locals and for the tourists who come to the Caribbean to sail. Once our daughter, Lucienne, was born, however, we decided that it was time to return to reality&#x2014;we wanted to raise her in the States. We lived again for a while in New York, then moved to Boulder, Colorado, and after some years, I found myself a single mom. This coincided with a faltering economy. Work was hard to come by. I wrote and tested recipes for a healthy lifestyle magazine, which I loved doing, although the pay was modest and it was difficult to make ends meet. Then I met a wonderful food stylist who taught me the tricks of that trade, but here in Boulder there is not much call for that sort of work. Also, I wanted to be baking and having people eat the food, not just making it look beautiful while rendering it inedible with styling tricks. So while these jobs kept me afloat and provided valuable experience, I was still dreaming my bakery dream.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Making confections is an art form. Every aspect of the process requires creative attention, from deciding what to bake to the final product. I love sifting flour, creaming together butter and sugar, adding in fragrant extracts and a pinch of salt. I love the comforting scents that fill the kitchen, and the thrill of coming up with clever garnishes. I especially love that magical moment when you pull a baking sheet from the oven and know that what you&#x2019;ve made is absolutely perfect.</p><p>I am forever dreaming up new creations. Inspiration is everywhere. It might be a new ingredient I&#x2019;ve just seen in a store or online (Himalayan pink salt!), or a particular combination of flavors that I&#x2019;ve never tried, like caramel corn, blueberries, ice cream, and peanut butter. Retro desserts inspired confections like our Carrot Cake Cookies, while more modern tastes led me down the road to Chai High Truffles. The change of seasons is always a fine time for discovering and celebrating new tastes. I look for comfort in winter, brightness for spring. Summer is for cool and refreshing sensations. Warming flavors make fall feel festive.</p><p>Our day in the kitchen begins early. We check orders, preheat the ovens, melt chocolates, and bring butter and eggs to room temperature. Everything is measured, ready to go before the baking process begins; this is known as <i>mise en place.</i> Proper <i>mise en place</i> ensures that all your equipment and ingredients are on hand the second they are needed in a recipe, and also ensures that you won&#x2019;t forget to add an ingredient. The brownies are in the oven, baking away, the sweet scent of chocolate filling the air, and then you get a sinking feeling that you may have forgotten to add the sugar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We&#x2019;ve all been there.</p><p>Once preparations have been properly made, we bake. We make frostings and dip confections. We package and label. Signature desserts, such as our award-winning OMG! Brownie Cheesecake Bars and Key Lime Kickers, are always on the order board.</p><p>At the end of the day, we lock up just like any other business. But at night, an armed security guard watches out for the treasures inside our door. Because we are not just any old bakery: Sweet Mary Jane is a medical marijuana bakery.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The idea of opening a marijuana bakery snuck up on me so quietly I can&#x2019;t say exactly when and how it took hold. In the mid-2000s, <i>Weeds</i>, a series about a widowed suburban mom who sold marijuana to survive, became a sensation on cable TV. I read an article about the health benefits of cannabis, watched a few news reports on medical marijuana dispensaries in California. Although I hadn&#x2019;t used marijuana in years, I became intrigued with the idea that this plant could improve lives. I&#x2019;d known since high school, of course, that cannabis could be baked into treats&#x2014;remember the pot brownies in <i>I Love You, Alice B. Toklas</i>? But now, for the first time, I thought about starting a business that combined medical marijuana with my love of baking.</p><p>I knew that Colorado&#x2019;s Amendment 20, passed in 2002, allowed for legal possession of marijuana for medical purposes, but the amounts permitted were small&#x2014;no more than two ounces&#x2014;and the amendment applied only to qualifying patients or caregivers. In 2007, a Colorado judge had overturned the required five-patients-to-one-caregiver ratio, opening the door to wider sales, but there was always a fear of prosecution, especially at the federal level. A theoretical problem, in my case, as I had no startup money.</p><p>Toward the end of 2009, with my daughter off at college, I traveled to Tortola for an extended visit. I was, at that time, in the habit of sending recipes in to cooking contests, and before I left, I entered my Chocolate-Filled Pandan Dumplings in TuttiFoodie&#x2014;Scharffen Berger&#x2019;s Chocolate Adventure Contest. Then I promptly forgot about it&#x2014;winning a recipe contest is like winning the lottery: largely a fantasy. The following spring I learned that I&#x2019;d won the $10,000 grand prize. I jumped for joy. (Seriously, I <i>jumped</i>, laughing and screaming, &#x201c;<i>I did it!</i>&#x201d; You can watch a video of the judge, Chef Elizabeth Falkner, making the recipe on my website, www.ilovesmj.com. It&#x2019;s delicious, by the way.) Suddenly, I had startup money.</p><p>Meanwhile, the laws in Colorado had changed. With the passage of HB-1284 in 2010, commercial dispensaries, grow operations, and the manufacture of edibles became fully legal. What I&#x2019;d always thought was a good idea now seemed like a great one.</p><p>From Tortola, I excitedly called dispensaries and spoke with owners. There have always been people selling, baking, and growing marijuana, but they mostly operated underground; you wouldn&#x2019;t find them on a member list at the local Chamber of Commerce. I had so many questions for these intrepid souls. What kind of people used medical marijuana? What specific conditions did it help? And what was the best way to administer the drug? Everyone was friendly and supportive and said that I should come see them when I returned to the States. I got on a plane, thinking happily, <i>Now I can start my bakery.</i></p><p>Back in Colorado, I read everything I could get my hands on about cannabis. I&#x2019;d always been interested in fresh and healthy eating, but now this interest took on urgency. I learned about the specific healing properties of cannabinoids, how they match <i>endo</i>cannabinoids, compounds produced naturally by our own bodies. Cannabinoids affect a range of human physiological processes; among other things, they help balance mood, alter the perception of pain, and can positively affect appetite and memory. (See Health Benefits from Cannabis; see also Appendix A for a handy chart, and Appendix B for a list of websites that provide further information.)</p><p>I applied for a Red Card. (Red Cards are issued by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment to residents over the age of eighteen, and are required to purchase medical marijuana.) Then I visited dispensaries. I hoped to learn as much as I could about the business, which was then in its infancy. I spoke with owners and met many patients. It was eye-opening, hearing how cannabis had changed their daily lives. In addition to smokable weed, most dispensaries stocked edibles: store-bought wafer cookies made into sandwich cookies with a homemade, infused-cream filling; chocolate brownies; lollipops and gummies. I knew there was a market. But without a solid industry history to examine, there were no proven formulas for how to run such an operation, no guidelines for how to bake properly with marijuana, or to grow.</p><p>I worked on a business plan for the bakery. This was loosely drawn at first and for my eyes only, but eventually I showed it around. My parents were supportive from the get-go. They lived in New York City, and at first couldn&#x2019;t fathom that marijuana was legal in Colorado&#x2014;they were worried that I might somehow be arrested; every time we spoke on the phone, they told me how proud they were of me for being brave. (My dad passed away in 2012, and I so wish he could have seen this book, and that I&#x2019;m still not in jail!) My daughter, Lucienne, who was in her sophomore year at George Washington University, became my greatest support. Each time she returned to Colorado, she helped with ideas for the menu and names for products. (Once she graduated, she came back to Boulder for good, and she is now part of the family business.)</p><p>Early on, a handful of friends stood behind me. Others thought I was crazy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to put all that prize money into&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. weed?!&#x201d;<i> </i>The idea <i>was</i> challenging. And the more I investigated the nitty-gritty of the business, the more daunting it seemed. For one thing, opening a marijuana bakery meant dealing with government bureaucracies.</p><p>Obtaining a Marijuana Infused Products license is the first step to opening a bakery. The application requires proof of residence, and you must give verifiable addresses for the previous five years. You must provide a detailed financial history, including bank and credit card statements and tax returns, and state where the money to fund the business will come from. You must also disclose your arrest record, if you have one, and the details of any bankruptcy proceedings, and you must be fingerprinted. And <i>before</i> you do any of this, you must have already secured a location for your business, either buying or renting, and it must be legal to run a marijuana business out of this space. Then you must prove legal possession of the premises to the state, and give them a diagram of your space showing where everything&#x2014;refrigerators, ovens, cabinets, and countertops&#x2014;will go, including the cameras. Then there are the fees! And oh, by the way, be prepared, because the rules change all the time. Rules about labeling, state-mandated warnings and recommended doses, THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) levels, how many doses are in each product, how exactly it has been infused, and which plant the marijuana came from.</p><p>It was overwhelming&#x2014;I was overwhelmed.</p><p>So I set aside the business plan for a while. I asked myself a question: <i>Why</i> did I want to open a marijuana bakery? To answer it, I followed my heart. I went back into the kitchen and baked.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Here I&#x2019;d like to give a shout-out to those anonymous, adventurous souls who first realized we could bake brownies with weed. What a spectacular idea. Back in the good old days (or maybe they were the bad old days?), you&#x2019;d choke down an overbaked brownie flecked with bits of something that tasted like lawn clippings. But I knew it was possible to create confections that would be like portals to our fondest memories. I didn&#x2019;t want to make &#x201c;stoner food.&#x201d; I wanted to bake as I would for a regular bakery, making beautiful treats that tasted as good as they looked.</p><p>I started small, testing infusing processes and recipes in my own home kitchen and giving away the results to friends.</p><p>The first treat I made was a brownie called Walnut Fantasy. I&#x2019;d been baking this brownie forever without weed, and knew it was delicious, so it was relatively simple to tweak the recipe and turn it into an infused treat. My taste-testers loved it. Next up was a brownie called Merciful, with four kinds of chocolate&#x2014;semisweet, unsweetened, cocoa powder, and white chocolate. This was also a hit. From there, I moved off the brownie path, adding True Conf...</p></p><h2>Late in the Day: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;With each new book by Tessa Hadley, I grow more convinced that she&#x2019;s one of the greatest stylists alive.&#x201d;</strong><strong>&#x2014;Ron Charles<em>, Washington Post</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>New York Times Book Review </em>Editors' Choice |A Parnassus First Editions Club Pick | Powell&#x2019;s Indispensable Book Club Pick </strong></p><p></p><p>The lives of two close-knit couples are irrevocably changed by an untimely death in the latest from Tessa Hadley, the acclaimed novelist and short story master who &#x201c;recruits admirers with each book&#x201d; (Hilary Mantel).<br><br>Alexandr and Christine and Zachary and Lydia have been friends since they first met in their twenties.

But the CIA isn&#x2019;t willing to lose its premier &#x201c;natural causes&#x201d; contract killer, and they force Rain to take on a high-risk assignment: eliminate a ruthless arms dealer operating in Southeast Asia. </p><p>The upside? Financial, of course, along with the possibility of moral redemption. But first, Rain will have to survive the downside: a second assassin zeroing in on the target; an alluring and dangerous woman with an agenda of her own; the possibility that the entire mission is nothing but an elaborate setup. From the gorgeous beaches of Rio to the glitzy casinos of Macau to the gritty back streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, Rain becomes a reluctant player in an international game far deadlier and more insidious than any he has encountered before. </p><p><i>Winner Take All</i> was previously published as <i>Rain Storm</i> in the US and <i>Choke Point</i> in the UK, the third in the bestselling John Rain assassin series. </p></p><p><p><b>Introduction to the New Edition</b></p><p>Rereading the books for this rerelease of the series has made me acutely aware of the degree to which whatever most interested me at the time I was writing surfaces in the story. I had left the CIA shortly before beginning <i>A Clean Kill in Tokyo</i>, for example, and I can see now how much surveillance, countersurveillance, and other aspects of tradecraft were still on my mind at the time. <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i> includes Osaka, where I lived from 1995 to 1997 after moving from Tokyo. And now I see how much the plot of <i>Winner Take All </i>is informed by the way 9/11, and more specifically America's overreaction to 9/11, was increasingly on my mind when I wrote it.</p><p>This is what I came up with when I was working on the manuscript in 2003:</p><p><i>"All right. Belghazi is part of a list. A hit list. Of course, it's not called a 'hit list.'

"The list is officially called the 'International Terrorist Threat Matrix,' or ITTM, for short. Unofficially, it's just called 'the list.' It was created and is continually updated by the Agency, in our capacity as central clearing house for all intelligence produced by the community. Its purpose is to identify the key players in the international terrorist infrastructure. Like the FBI's Most Wanted List, but broader. You know, a Who's Who..."</i></p><p><i>"The list existed before nine-eleven, but it's been substantially revised and expanded since then. And, since then, it has also doubled as a hit list -- a nice, deniable hit list, because it's really just a wiring diagram and has been around in one form or another for a long time. So no one had to worry about giving the order to draw up a brand new list that might make for riveting testimony in front of a hypocritical Congressional committee some time down the road..."</i></p><p><i>He took a sip from his cup.

The first step of practicing Internal Elixir Qigong has been known as Small Cyclic Heaven (Small Circulation or Microcosmic Meditation). After completing Small Cyclic Heaven, a practitioner will learn Grand Cyclic Heaven (Grand Circulation or Macrocosmic Meditation). The purpose of Grand Cyclic Heaven is to re-open the Heaven Eye (Third Eye) to unite the natural spirit and human spirit. This is the ultimate goal of spiritual enlightenment in both Daoism (Taoism) and Buddhism. Although these kinds of meditations are popular, very few scientific books or documents are available to the public.</p>The Foundation of Internal Elixir Cultivation<p>In order to reach the goal of longevity and spiritual enlightenment, the Qigong practitioner must learn Internal Elixir Qigong. The first step to learning is to understand the theory and the method of Embryonic Breathing. Practicing this breathing technique will help you to establish your central energy system, conserve your energy, and store this energy to abundant levels. Once you have established this foundation, you will be able to practice Small Cyclic Heaven (Small Circulation or Microcosmic Orbit) and Grand Cyclic Heaven (Grand Circulation of Macrocosmic Orbit) effectively. It is understood that without this foundation, the root of spiritual enlightenment will not be established and the study and the practice of spiritual enlightenment, through meditation, will be in vain.</p><ul><li>Embryonic Breathing theory and techniques were kept secret in Buddhist and Daoist (Taoist) monasteries.</li><li>Dr. Yang discusses most of the available documents, translates and comments upon them.</li><li>Scientific analysis and summary of the practice methods.</li><li>A comprehensive, straightforward way to understand and practice Embryonic Breathing.</li></ul></p><p><b>FINALIST for Book of the Year Award: </b> Health, 2003 <br> (sponsored by Foreword Magazine)<strong>Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming</strong> is a renowned author and teacher of Chinese martial arts and Qigong.

Pivotal are the questions surrounding why Johnson was ignored by the core black audience of his time yet now celebrated as the greatest figure in blues history.</p><p>Trying to separate myth from reality, biographer Elijah Wald studies the blues from the inside -- not only examining recordings but also the recollections of the musicians themselves, the African-American press, as well as examining original research. What emerges is a new appreciation for the blues and the movement of its artists from the shadows of the 1930s Mississippi Delta to the mainstream venues frequented by today's loyal blues fans.</p></p><p><p>Elijah Waldis a writer and musician whose books include Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues and <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music</em>. A respected expert on the folk revival, he collaborated with Dave Van Ronk on <em>The Mayor of MacDougal Street</em>, the inspiration for the Coen Brothers&#x2019; film <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>. His awards include a 2002 Grammy, and he has taught blues history at UCLA and lectured widely on American, Mexican, and world music. He currently lives in Medford, Massachusetts.</p><p> The congressional proclamation of 2003 as the "Year of the Blues" enabled all manner of film, concert and educational initiatives meant to raise public awareness and appreciation of a genre that Congress asserts "is the most influential form of American roots music." While few would argue otherwise, some have responded to all this Capitol Hill pomp by raising questions about the relevance of the blues in the 21st century, when the music's audience has skewed overwhelmingly white, and its most rabid supporters appear to be the fraternity of beer-ad music supervisors.</p><p> Elijah Wald is not so interested in what the blues means in its year of distinction, but he is very interested in how it came to mean something other than what it once did. In Escaping the Delta, he sets out to explore "the paradox of [Robert] Johnson's reputation: that his music excited so little interest among the black blues fans of his time, and yet is now widely hailed as the greatest and most important blues ever recorded." Wald sees this paradox as symbolizing a larger gulf between the blues as heard by the black audience in its own time -- who knew it as hip, popular music -- and a later, mostly white audience that romanticized the blues as "the heart-cry of a suffering people." Not a book about Johnson per se, Escaping the Delta is a thoughtful, impassioned historical essay about that gulf.</p><p>Wald spends the first several chapters laying out the prewar musical terrain in which the blues came to the fore, through a synthesis of murkily understood received culture and the skills of those who refined the blues into a consciously commercial -- not naively folk -- art. After a quick sketch of Johnson's life and a critical analysis of his recordings, Wald carries the story through to the folk-revival "discovery" of the blues in the 1950s and the British Invasion's canonizing stamp of the 1960s, then adds a coda in which he seeks to lay permanently to rest the resilient myth that Johnson met the devil at a crossroads and sold his soul for other-worldly musicianship.</p><p>If the first half of the story sounds a lot more interesting than the second, Wald may feel the same way. Escaping the Delta is most engaged in the early going, as he dismantles genre stereotypes via endearing tidbits such as that blues singer Memphis Minnie's set list included George Gershwin's "Lady Be Good" and that Johnson rated the Sons of the Pioneers' "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" among his favorite songs. The book is much more hurried and polemically loose on the downhill side, as Wald takes broad swipes at an uptight blues "cognoscenti" and cites more dully familiar anecdotes such as the time the Rolling Stones sat at the feet of Howlin' Wolf. A professional musician himself, Wald can regale a listener with pinpoint comparisons of Johnson and Kokomo Arnold recordings that were each waxed more than 60 years ago. Such record-geek soliloquies can clear out a cocktail party, but here they serve a reader well. For Wald is rarely less than convincing when he makes his case for what Johnson and the prewar blues audience were actually hearing in their own day.</p><p> Often it wasn't the blues. Repeatedly Wald drives home the point that neither the musicians nor the audience frequenting a Clarksdale, Miss., juke joint in 1937 likely limited their taste to visceral fare like Johnson's "Cross Road Blues." They'd probably never heard it. In Wald's estimation, black listeners tended to prefer the smooth, urbane vocals of the far better-selling (in Johnson's day) blues pianist Leroy Carr, and if the jukebox selections noted by a 1944 field recording team are any indication, some may have liked the "sweet band" leader Sammy Kaye better than either.</p><p> In this fashion Wald does not seek to temper admiration for Johnson and his brilliant Delta generation. Rather he wants to rescue them from a historical narrative he sees as having been edited by record producers (the blues were good business), folklorists (the blues were authentic) and Rolling Stones fans (the blues were outlaw), each of which had a separate agenda for the music.</p><p> But Wald's focus on folkies and Stones freaks is problematic. For all his interest in the complexity of black-white, blues-pop musical exchanges in the pre-World War II South, he largely ignores that dynamic as carried through to the volatile postwar context. The South is full of tales of white kids who during the segregation era snuck away to off-limits black nightclubs, and of black kids who grew up with their ears tuned to the Grand Ole Opry. Wald is rightly sympathetic to the frustrations of the latter (quoting Bobby "Blue" Bland, "it was the wrong time and the wrong place for a black singer to make it singing white country blues") but oddly uninterested in the experiences of the former. He mentions Elvis Presley mostly in passing and scarcely touches on the impact of postwar black radio. Yet that generation's story had every bit as much to do with evolving perceptions (and misperceptions) of the blues as did any folk revivalism or Stones evangelism.</p><p> Nevertheless, the best studies inspire further study, and the best music books inspire further listening. Escaping the Delta could well do both. Blank spots aside, one comes away respecting Wald's view that far too much time has been spent wondering if Robert Johnson really sold his soul to the devil, and far too little time listening at the musical crossroads where he actually lived. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Daniel Cooper</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Purdy draws on law, letters, philosophy, science, social science, politics, and aesthetics; from Locke, Rousseau, and Burke, through Jefferson, all the way to the recent past of the ecological age&#x2019;s beginnings, the urgent catastrophe of Rachel Carson&#x2019;s <i>Silent Spring</i> (1962), and our contemporary moment, after &#x2018;crisis had become the normal state of affairs,&#x2019; closing with ideas about nature and the posthuman from Rosi Braidotti, among others. Somewhere in between, Purdy manages to give a history of private property&#x2015;how &#x2018;each version of nature has its economy.&#x2019; If the ominous political near past and the planet&#x2019;s environmental emergency feel present on every page, so, too, does a sense of the role we each have in shaping the future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Liz Larner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Artforum</i></b></p><h2>The Irish Inheritance: A Jayne Sinclair Genealogical Mystery (Jayne Sinclair Genealogical Mysteries)</h2><p>June 8, 1921.

The birds were singing, the grass was growing and small creatures were busy everywhere, filling the air with the gentle buzzing, rustling song of life returning after winter...<br><br>Farmer Pettson begins to sow his vegetables and because Findus does't like vegetables he decides to plant one of his meatballs instead. However, keeping the vegetable garden safe from the farm animals proves a hard task for Findus and Pettson.</p><p><b>Sven Nordqvist</b> is a leading Swedish children's illustrator and writer. Nordqvist was born in Helsingborg and grew up in Halmstad, Sweden. He originally wanted to be an illustrator but was rejected by several art schools. Instead, he studied architecture in Lund and worked as a lecturer in architecture in the university. Meanwhile, he looked for work as an illustrator of advertisements, posters, and picture books. In 1983, he won first prize in a children's book competition and since then has worked exclusively as an author and illustrator of children's books, which have won awards in Sweden and Germany. The Findus and Pettson stories draw on his own playful adventures with his two young sons. Nordqvist's unique illustrations are inspired by his delight in everyday life.Farmer Pettson decides it&#39;s time to sow vegetable seeds and plant potatoes, but his cat Findus does not want to grow vegetables: he likes meatballs so decides to grow those. What follows is a hilarious riot of seeds being sown, then all the chickens deciding to come and scratch them up and dig for worms. Findus and Pettson try desperately to protect the patch, but the characterful chickens are determined, and there is great humour in the dialogue and illustrations. Eventually a truce is reached, but then a pig and a herd of cows trample their hard work. It&#39;s a classic catch-and-chase story brilliantly done. Juno This was our first time meeting Findus and Pettson and we were delighted when we opened the package to find that they are beautiful, large hardback books! We were very excited to get started and Bundle Number One chose this book to share first (probably because he loves meatballs and we have been planting seeds in our garden recently!) The story begins &#39;On a beautiful Spring morning...&#39; ideal seeing as we have a seasonal focus here at Monster House and Bundle Number One is currently fascinated with all things &#39;Spring&#39;. A stunningly beautiful double paged illustration depicts Farmer Pettson at work in his garden, preparing to start planting...&#39;It&#39;s time&#39; he said &#39;today we can sow vegetables and plant potatoes...&#39;but Findus the cat has other ideas...&#39;...Can&#39;t we plant meatballs instead?&#39; The story follows the two friends as they sow their seeds (and meatball!) only for their efforts to be scuppered by their hungry hens! They soon find a way to trick the cheeky hens back inside the fence. The next day there is more trouble, the Hens have found their way out again ...or have they? Add to this the worry of a fox and something has to be done! Findus and Pettson come up with a clever plan to stay up and guard the farm all night, brave Findus takes up his position in his tree house and waits...The next morning, Pettson is awoken by an alarmed Findus and discovers that this time, an entire herd of cows have found their way in... Cows! So how do they trick the cows out of their garden, and does Findus ever manage to plant a meatball...? Well, you will have to read the book and find out. This book really is lovely, a well written story with a humorous plot that adults and children alike can enjoy. The illustrations are excellent, the more you look at them the more details you see, look out for the tiny creatures in the background...Bundle Number One absolutely loved this story and I was amazed that he sat and listened for such a long story (in comparison to his usual picture books) I think the combination of excitement, humour and detailed, absorbing illustrations worked their magic. These are his thoughts on the story; &#39;It was funny when the chickens dig for worms because they make a mess and I like it when Findus wakes up Pettson and the string is tied around his big toe and the pictures are funny!&#39; This story has been requested, and shared many times since it arrived and we look forward to sharing our next Findus and Pettson review with you!...as for how the friends trick the cows out of their garden, and does Findus ever manage to grow a meatball?

Sometimes they learn from those mistakes. Other times, they return to those behaviors and cycle through failed relationship after failed relationship. Sometimes those behaviors become an addiction to love that may leave a person feeling unhappy, unfulfilled, lonely, or worse. Lesbian Love Addiction: Understanding the Urge to Merge and How to Heal When Things go Wrong makes visible the elements of love addiction that many lesbians suffer from. <br><br>Love addiction for lesbians comes in many forms. Some struggle by sexually acting out and others are serial relationship junkies, jumping from one relationship into the next. Some are addicted to the high of falling in love and once that wears off don&#x2019;t know how to handle the day-to-day realities of a committed relationship. Some are even addicted to fantasy and intrigue, while others are love avoidants and sexual anorexics. Love avoidants may be able to get into a relationship but once they are fully committed, struggle with feeling smothered. Others may avoid intimate or sexual relationships all together, becoming sexually anorexic. Some may even vacillate between all of these. The underlying component and common denominator in all of these scenarios is the &#x201c;Urge to Merge.&#x201d; <br><br>Lesbian Love Addiction is designed to help ameliorate at least part of this problem. Lauren D. Costine offers insight for lesbians, bisexual women in relationships with women, queer women, and more specifically, any woman who loves women, as well as their family and friends, and health care professionals, into the psychology of lesbian love addiction. It will give those who struggle with and suffer from love addiction ways to understand, cope, and heal from this debilitating addiction. It will give those who work with this population new tools to use to do this more effectively. Mostly, it will help lesbians understand their relationship failures and how to heal from problems associated with them, so they may grow and cultivate happier, more fulfilling connections in the future.</p><p>Lauren Costine, PhD, is an LA-based therapist specializing in therapy with for lesbians.

Theology, history, physiology, psychology and sociology intermingle to a specific end. She takes truths, re-examines and perhaps, repurposes those truths to create an interesting hypothesis. Lesbian Love Addiction shines a light on a particular manifestation of humanity and in better understanding that perspective; we're all positioned to better understand ourselves. Clearly, whether it's ancient Vikings, pre-Christian patriarchs, contemporary talk show hosts fretting about femi-nazis or presidential contenders wallowing in sexist slurs, the modern feminist has an ancient torch to bear. Dr. Costine is a gifted speaker, writer and philosopher and her work will continue to generate both heat and light. (<i>Gay San Diego</i>)<br><br>Lesbian Love Addiction: Understanding the Urge to Merge and How to Heal When Things Go Wrong discusses the phenomenon of love addiction that many lesbians suffer from, discussing the kinds of behaviors that lead to constant failed relationships and how the drive to merge with another at the cost of one's identity results in dysfunctional relationships. It's a common adage that lesbians meet, fall in love, and move in with one another in very short time frames; but Lesbian Love Addiction analyzes why, and provides important insights not just into behaviors, but how to modify them for greater success. The result is highly recommended for any psychology or women's issues collection.

Or a tedious one.<br>It all depends on what stage of the process you&#x2019;re taking part in.<br><br>� � �<br><br>Rigg and Father usually set the traps together, because it was Rigg who had the knack of seeing the paths that the animals they wanted were still using.<br><br>Father was blind to it&#x2014;he could never see the thin shimmering trails in the air that marked the passage of living creatures through the world. But to Rigg it was, and always had been, part of what his eyes could see, without any effort at all. The newer the path, the bluer the shimmer; older ones were green, yellow; the truly ancient ones tended toward red.<br><br>As a toddler, Rigg had quickly learned what the shimmering meant, because he could see everyone leaving trails behind them as they went. Besides the color, there was a sort of signature to each one, and over the years Rigg became adept at recognizing them. He could tell at a glance the difference between a human and an animal, or between the different species, and if he looked closely, he could sort out the tracks so clearly that he could follow the path of a single person or an individual beast.<br><br>Once, when Father first started taking him out trapping, Rigg had made the mistake of following a greenish trail. When they reached the end of it, there were only a few old bones scattered where animals had torn the carcass many months ago.<br><br>Father had not been angry. In fact, he seemed amused. &#x201c;We need to find animals with their skins still fresh,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;And a little meat on them for us to eat. But if I had a bone collection, these would do nicely. Don&#x2019;t worry, Rigg.&#x201d;<br><br>Father never criticized Rigg when it came to his knack for pathfinding. He simply accepted what Rigg could do, and encouraged him to hone his skill. But whenever Rigg started to tell someone about what he could do, or even speak carelessly, so they might be able to figure out that he had some unusual ability, Father was merciless, silencing him at once.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your life,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;There are those who would kill you for this. And others who would take you away from me and make you live in a terrible place and make you follow paths for them, and it would lead to them killing the ones you found.&#x201d; And, to make sure Rigg understood how serious this was, he added, &#x201c;And they would not be beasts, Rigg. You would be helping them murder people.&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe Father shouldn&#x2019;t have told him that, because it haunted Rigg&#x2019;s thoughts for months afterward&#x2014;and not just by giving him nightmares. It made Rigg feel very powerful, to think that his ability might help men find criminals and outlaws.<br><br>But all that was when Rigg was still little&#x2014;seven or eight years old. Now he was thirteen and his voice was finally changing, and Father kept telling him little things about how to deal with women. They like this, they hate that, they&#x2019;ll never marry a boy who does this or doesn&#x2019;t do that. &#x201c;Washing is the most important thing,&#x201d; Father said&#x2014;often. &#x201c;So you don&#x2019;t stink. Girls don&#x2019;t like it when boys stink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wash later, just before we get back home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll wash every day,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like your stink either.&#x201d;<br><br>Rigg didn&#x2019;t really believe that. The pelts they took from the trapped animals stank a lot worse than Rigg ever could. In fact, the stink of the animal skins <i>was</i> Rigg&#x2019;s main odor; it clung to his clothing and hair like burrs. But Rigg didn&#x2019;t argue. There was no point in arguing.<br><br>For instance, this morning, before they separated, they were talking as they walked through the woods. Father encouraged talking. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not hunters, we&#x2019;re trappers,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if the animals run from us right now, because we&#x2019;ll catch them later, when they can&#x2019;t see us or hear us or even smell us.&#x201d;<br><br>Thus Father used their endless walks for teaching. &#x201c;You have a severe case of ignorance, boy,&#x201d; he often said. &#x201c;I have to do my best to cure that sickness, but it seems like the more I teach you, the more things you don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know everything I need to know already,&#x201d; Rigg always said. &#x201c;You teach me all kinds of strange things that have nothing to do with the way we live. Why do I need to know about astronomy or banking or all these languages you make me speak? I find the paths of animals, we trap them, we sell the furs, and I know how to do every bit of it.&#x201d;<br><br>To which Father always replied, &#x201c;See how ignorant you are? You don&#x2019;t even know why you need to know the things you don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So tell me,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br><br>&#x201c;I would, but you&#x2019;re too ignorant to understand the reasons why your ignorance is a fatal disease. I have to educate you before you&#x2019;ll understand why it was worth the bother trying to tan your brain.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what he called their schooling sessions: tanning Rigg&#x2019;s brain.<br><br>Today they were following the trail of an elusive pench, whose pelt was worth ten otters, because penchfur was so thick and the colors so vibrant. During a brief lull in Father&#x2019;s endless teaching, during which he was presumably trying to come up with another problem for Rigg to work out in his head (&#x201c;If a board fence is nine hands high and a hundred and twenty yards long, how many feet of four-inch slat will you need to buy from the lumbermill, knowing that the slats come in twenty- and fourteen-hand lengths?&#x201d; Answer: &#x201c;What good is a nine-hand-high slat fence? Any animal worth keeping inside it can climb it or jump over it or knock it down.&#x201d; Then a knuckle on the back of his head and he had to come up with the real answer), Rigg started talking about nothing at all.<br><br>&#x201c;I love autumn,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;I know it means winter is coming, but winter is the reason why people need our furs so I can&#x2019;t feel bad about <i>that</i>. It&#x2019;s the colors of the leaves before they fall, and the crunching of the fallen leaves underfoot. The whole world is different.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The whole world?&#x201d; asked Father. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know that on the southern half of the world, it isn&#x2019;t even autumn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know that,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br><br>&#x201c;And even in our hemisphere, near the tropics it&#x2019;s never autumn and leaves don&#x2019;t fall, except high in the mountains, like here. And in the far north there are no trees, just tundra and ice, so leaves don&#x2019;t fall. The whole world! You mean the tiny little wedge of the world that you&#x2019;ve seen with your own ignorant eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all the world I&#x2019;ve seen,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m ignorant of the rest, that&#x2019;s your fault.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You <i>aren&#x2019;t</i> ignorant of the rest, you just haven&#x2019;t seen it. I&#x2019;ve certainly <i>told</i> you about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, Father, I have all kinds of memorized lists in my head, but here&#x2019;s my question: How do you know all these things about parts of the world we can never ever see because they&#x2019;re outside the Wall?&#x201d;<br><br>Father shrugged. &#x201c;I know everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A certain teacher once told me that the only truly stupid man is the one who doesn&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s ignorant.&#x201d; Rigg loved this game, partly because Father eventually got impatient with it and told him to shut up, which would mean Rigg had won.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that I know everything because there are no questions to which I don&#x2019;t know the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;So answer this question: Do you know the answers to the questions you haven&#x2019;t thought of yet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought of all the questions,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>&#x201c;That only means you&#x2019;ve stopped trying to think of new ones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There <i>are</i> no new questions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Father, what will I ask you next?&#x201d;<br><br>Father huffed. &#x201c;All questions about the future are moot. I know all the answers that are knowable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought. Your claim to know everything was empty brag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Careful how you speak to your father and teacher.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I chose my words with the utmost precision,&#x201d; said Rigg, echoing a phrase that Father often used. &#x201c;Information only matters if it helps us make correct guesses about the future.&#x201d; Rigg ran into a low-hanging branch. This happened rather often. He had to keep his gaze upward, because the pench had moved from branch to branch. &#x201c;The pench crossed the stream,&#x201d; he said. Then he clambered down the bank.<br><br>Vaulting over a stream did not interrupt the conversation. &#x201c;Since you can&#x2019;t know which information you&#x2019;ll need in the future, you need to know everything about the past. Which I do,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>&#x201c;You know all the kinds of weather you&#x2019;ve seen,&#x201d; said Rigg, &#x201c;but it doesn&#x2019;t mean you know what weather we&#x2019;ll have next week, or if there&#x2019;ll be a kind of weather you never saw before. I think you&#x2019;re very nearly as ignorant as I am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>I win, said Rigg silently.<br><br>A few minutes later, the trail of the pench went up into the air and kept going out of sight. &#x201c;An eagle got him,&#x201d; Rigg said sadly. &#x201c;It happened before we even started following his path. It was in the past, so no doubt you knew it all along.&#x201d;<br><br>Father didn&#x2019;t bother to answer, but let Rigg lead them back up the bank and through the woods to where Rigg first spotted the pench&#x2019;s trail. &#x201c;You know how to lay the traps almost as well as I do,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;So you go do it, and then come find me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t find you,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;You know I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know any such thing, because no one can <i>know</i> a false thing, one can only believe it with certainty until it is contradicted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see your path,&#x201d; said Rigg, &#x201c;because you&#x2019;re my father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true that I&#x2019;m your father, and it&#x2019;s true you can&#x2019;t see my path, but why do you assume that there&#x2019;s a causal connection between them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it can&#x2019;t go the other way&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t be my father <i>because</i> I can&#x2019;t see your path.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have any other fathers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know of any other pathfinder like you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Therefore you can&#x2019;t test to see if you can&#x2019;t see the paths of your other fathers, because you don&#x2019;t have any. And you can&#x2019;t ask other pathfinders whether they can find their fathers&#x2019; paths, because you don&#x2019;t know any. So you have no evidence one way or another about what causes you not to be able to see my path.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I go to bed now?&#x201d; asked Rigg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already too tired to go on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor feeble brain,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;But how it could wear out I don&#x2019;t know, considering you don&#x2019;t use it. How will you find me? By following my path with your <i>eyes</i> and your <i>brain</i> instead of this extraordinary ability of yours. You&#x2019;ll see where I leave footprints, where I break branches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t leave footprints if you don&#x2019;t want to, and you never break branches unless you want to,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re more observant than I thought. But since I told you to find me after the traps are set, doesn&#x2019;t it stand to reason that I will make it possible for you to do it, by leaving footprints and breaking branches?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make sure you fart frequently, too,&#x201d; Rigg suggested. &#x201c;Then I can track you with my nose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bring me a nice switch to beat you with when you come,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;Now go and do your work before the day gets too warm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will you be doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The thing that I need to do,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;When you need to know what that is, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>And they parted.<br><br>Rigg set the traps carefully, because he knew this was a test. Everything was a test. Or a lesson. Or a punishment from which he was supposed to learn a lesson, on which he would be tested later, and punished if he hadn&#x2019;t learned it.<br><br>I wish I could have a day, just a single day, without tests or lessons or punishments. A day to be myself, instead of being Father&#x2019;s project to make me into a great man. I don&#x2019;t want to be great. I just want to be Rigg.<br><br>Even taking great care with the traps, leaving them in each beast&#x2019;s most common path, it didn&#x2019;t take <i>that</i> long to set them all. Rigg stopped to drink, and then to empty his bladder and bowel and wipe his butt with leaves&#x2014;another reason to be grateful for the autumn. Then Rigg backtracked his own trail to the place where he and Father parted.<br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t a sign of where Father went. Rigg knew his starting direction because he had seen him go. But when he walked that way, Father had left no broken branches, no footprints, nothing to mark his passing.<br><br>Of course, thought Rigg. This is a test.<br><br>So he stood there and thought. Father might mean me to continue in the direction I saw him go when we parted, and only after a long time will he leave a mark. That would be a lesson in patience and trust.<br><br>Or Father might have doubled back as soon as I was out of sight, and left in another direction entirely, blazing a trail for my eyes to see, but only after I had walked blindly for a while in each random direction.<br><br>Rigg spent an hour doubling back again and again, so he could search for Father&#x2019;s signs of passing in every direction. No luck, of course. That would have been far too easy a challenge.<br><br>Again he stood and thought. Father listed the signs he could leave; therefore he isn&#x2019;t going to leave any of those signs. He&#x2019;ll leave different signs and my job is to be creative and think of what they might be.<br><br>Rigg remembered his own snotty remark about farts and sniffed the air, but he had only the ordinary human sense of smell and he couldn&#x2019;t detect a thing that way, so that couldn&#x2019;t be Father&#x2019;s game.<br><br>Sight and smell haven&#x2019;t worked. Taste seemed ludicrous. Could Father leave a clue using sound?<br><br>Rigg gave it a try. He stood in absolute stillness so that he could truly hear the sounds of the forest. It was more than holding his body still. He had to calm himself and concentrate, so that he could separate sounds in his mind. His own breathing&#x2014;he had to be aware of it, then move past it so he could hear the other sounds around him. Then the near sounds&#x2014;a scurry of a mouse, the scamper of a squirrel, the jarring notes of a bird&#x2019;s song, the burrowing of a mole.<br><br>And then he heard it. Very distant. A voice. A human voice. Impossible to know what words it was saying, if any; impossible to know if it was Father. But he could tell what general direction it was coming from, and so he moved that way, trotting along a path used by many deer so he could make good time. There was a low rise on the left that might block sound&#x2014;he wanted to get past that; he knew there was a stream to the right, and if he got too close to that the babble of the water might drown out the voice.<br><br>Then he stopped and went into stillness again. This time he was reasonably sure the voice was Father&#x2019;s. And he was more certain of the direction.<br><br>It took two more stops before he could hear the voice clearly enough to run continuously till he reached Father. He was saving up some choice criticisms of this tracking method when he finally reached the spot where the voice was coming from, a clearing where a large tree had recently fallen. In fact, the path of the falling tree was still sparkling blue. There was little occasion to follow plants, since they moved so little, except a bit of waving and bending in the breeze, but this tree must have fallen only a few hours ago, and the movement of its fall had marked a bright path through the air.<br><br>Rigg couldn&#x2019;t see Father at all.<br><br>&#x2018;&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>He expected some remark with a barbed lesson in it, but instead Father said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come far enough, Rigg. You&#x2019;ve found me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I haven&#x2019;t, Father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come as close as I want you to. Listen carefully. Do not come any closer to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since I don&#x2019;t know where you are&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>Rigg fell silent and listened.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pinned under the tree,&#x201d; said Father.<br><br>Rigg cried out and to...</p><h2>The Astral Body: And Other Astral Phenomena (Classics Series)</h2><p>In print since 1927, this study of our subtle body is based on the works of Theosophical authors and noted clairvoyants, including H.

Schmitt here unfolds his view of world history from the Peloponnesian War to European colonial expansion to the birth pangs of capitalism, while polemically setting Nazi Germany as a continental land power against Britain and the United States as its maritime enemies. In <em>Land and Sea</em>, Schmitt offers his interpretations of the rise of Venice, piracy, "corsair capitalism," the spatial revolution of European colonial expansion, the rise of the British empire, and his readings of thinkers as diverse as Seneca, Shakespeare, Herman Melville, and Benjamin Disraeli.<br><br>This new and authorized edition from Telos Press Publishing, translated by Samuel Garrett Zeitlin and edited by Russell A. Berman and Samuel Garrett Zeitlin, includes extensive textual annotations that compare critical variations between the original 1942 edition of <em>Land and Sea</em> and the subsequent editions published in 1954 and 1981.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German"<em>Land and Sea</em> is Carl Schmitt's ambitious and often beautiful effort to render the geo-political history of humankind as grand fable. Schmitt muses over man's fate as he transformed from land-bound creature to conqueror of the seas and eventually the skies. The subtext of the work concerns Germany's precarious position as defender of humanity's fundamental political essence as it withstands sieges from various trans-territorial forces, especially England, the Soviet Union, the United States and, most chillingly, the Jews. Berman and Zeitlin must be commended for making this astounding work available to English speaking audiences in such an impeccably translated and annotated form for the first time."<br>&#x2014;<strong>John P. McCormick</strong>, Professor of Political Science, University of Chicago, and author of <em>Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism: Against Politics as Technology</em><br><br>"With its fable-like quality, philosophical tone, and deep historical orientation, <em>Land and Sea</em> is one of Schmitt's most powerful and evocative works. A profound meditation on the forces shaping twentieth-century history, it challenges us to think anew about the possibilities (and risks) of our global future. Yet, as Zeitlin's meticulous introduction demonstrates so clearly, the origins of Schmitt's thinking on these themes must be traced to the specific political and military ambitions of the Third Reich. This tension between Schmitt's grand philosophical history (fluidly translated here) and the often brutal concreteness of its compositional context makes <em>Land and Sea</em> an even more fascinating&#x2014;if troubling&#x2014;work." <br>&#x2014;<strong>David Bates</strong>, Professor and Chair, Department of Rhetoric, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"<em>Land and Sea</em> is one of Carl Schmitt's most intriguing texts, an important contribution to the literature of global power. It is certain to provoke debate."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Ellen Kennedy</strong>, Professor of Political Science, University of Pennsylvania<br><br>"Samuel Zeitlin has given us a careful and very readable English translation of one Schmitt's key texts on the philosophy of history and the foundations of international law. <em>Land and Sea</em> illuminates the theoretical background of Schmitt's theory of the '<em>nomos</em> of the Earth,' and it is supplemented by a valuable introduction and helpful editorial notes. The volume is required reading for all scholars seriously interested in Schmitt."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Lars Vinx</strong>, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Bilkent University, author of the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> entry on Schmitt, and editor and translator of <em>The Guardian of the Constitution: Hans Kelsen and Carl Schmitt on the Limits of Constitutional Law</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2015)<br><br>"Schmitt's 'Dialogue of Land and Sea' is an extraordinary text: erudite, bizarre, philosophic, and theatrical. Who but Schmitt would name a character 'MacFuture'? Who else could revive the dialogue form to interrogate modernity? Who else could conduct a dialogue with Heidegger between the lines of a mid-twentieth-century radio play? Zeitlin has given us a great gift in translating this curious, complex, and very entertaining dialogue." --<strong>Anne Norton</strong>, Professor of Political Science, University of Pennsylvania</p><h2>The Count of Monte Cristo (Townsend Library Edition)</h2><p>This Townsend Library classic has been carefully edited to be more accessible to today&#39;s students.

Ozzy was the singer in the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, and they meant business. In an era when rock bands were measured by how 'heavy' they were, no one was weightier than Black Sabbath. All four founding members of the original Black Sabbath grew up within half-a-mile of each other in a tiny Birmingham suburb. Though all shared a deep love of music--The Beatles for Ozzy, the Mothers of Invention for Geezer, the Shadows and Chet Atkins for Iommi, and Gene Kruppa for Ward&#x2015; they formed their group "as the quickest way out of the slums." This is the story of how they made that dream come true--and how it then turned into a nightmare for all of them. At the height of their fame, Sabbath discovered they'd been so badly ripped off by their managers they didn't even own their own songs. They looked for salvation from Don Arden&#x2015;an even more notorious gangster figure, who resurrected their career but still left them indebted to him, financially and personally. It finally came to a head when in 1979 they sacked Ozzy: "For being too out of control--even for us," as Bill Ward put it. The next fifteen years were a war between the post-Ozzy Sabbath and Ozzy himself, whose solo career overshadowed Sabbath so much that a reunion was entirely on his terms. Or rather, those of his wife and manager&#x2015;to add a further bitter twist for Sabbath, daughter of Don Arden &#x2015;Sharon Osbourne.</p></p><p><p>MICK WALL is the UK's best-known rock writer.

Which seems reasonable enough if you fantasized as a kid about becoming a tax attorney or insurance adjuster as a kid. The principle doesn&#x2019;t work as well for people like me, who dreamed about becoming a cowboy.</p><p>My mother reminisces about the way I played pretend in the living room, wearing nothing except pajama bottoms, a mini Stetson hat, and black boots with silver spurs. I&#x2019;d force my cowboy boots onto the wrong feet, which made the whole scenario a little more precious and a lot more absurd.

Heck, I&#x2019;d never even seen pictures. In my version of El Paso, the townsfolk rode horses and never left home without pistols strapped to their hips. Only one lawman lived there, and he could usually be found outside the jailhouse smoking a hand-rolled cigarette. I assumed most residents wrangled cattle during the day, lay under a blanket of stars at night, and after a hard week&#x2019;s work, gathered at the saloon for a frothy mug of sarsaparilla and a hand of Texas Hold &#x2019;Em.</p><p>When I was old enough to move to the city of my choosing, however, El Paso didn&#x2019;t even make the Top 10.

The only cows we have are served medium rare and will cost you a second mortgage. The city&#x2019;s strict gun laws mean you&#x2019;re unlikely to see a pistol unless it&#x2019;s resting in a police officer&#x2019;s holster, and the closest thing you&#x2019;ll find to a tumbleweed is a windswept potato chip bag.</p><p>And yet, New York City has a certain frontier-like quality. Countless people arrive each year&#x2014;in moving vans, like modern covered wagons&#x2014;with hopes of forging a new life, conquering the iron wilderness, and if they&#x2019;re lucky, maybe even striking gold. The scent of opportunity is everywhere&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve caught whiffs on street corners and nearly choked on it on Wall Street.</p><p>America&#x2019;s biggest metropolis is diverse enough that citizens can curate their own version. The New York of the Upper East Side is not at all like the New York of Astoria, Queens. So different are the two neighborhoods that it&#x2019;s almost laughable for them to claim the same city of residence.</p><p>I settled into the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg, which is less like <i>Seinfeld </i>and more like <i>Blue Bloods</i>. The buildings are smattered with graffiti and bursting with third-wave coffee shops. Hipsters and Latinos mingle with a remnant population of Hasidic Jews who have decided to stay put even as the neighborhood gentrifies. (I spy more menorahs during Hanukkah than twinkling trees at Christmas.)</p><p>On the waterfront, Brooklyn residents lounge with loved ones on benches beside the East River and watch the summer sun sink into the skyline. The final rays of dusk wash Manhattan&#x2019;s skyscrapers with sheets of light on clear nights. During the autumn months, McCarren Park fills with guitarists and flag football teams and a weekend farmer&#x2019;s market where you can purchase apple cider and tupelo honey and rhubarb jelly.</p><p>Living here is just as lovely as it sounds.</p><p>The delights of New York did not blindside me, of course. But I never anticipated, upon arriving, that I&#x2019;d run into a crippling language barrier. Sure, I could order a late-night kebab from a halal street cart or relay an address to a taxicab driver. I spoke English as well as I always had.</p><p>My problem was that I could no longer &#x201c;speak God.&#x201d;</p><p>Prior to moving to New York, I resided in a suburban neighborhood in the heart of the Bible Belt. Almost all my friends were Christian, and most of us attended the same type of church. I worked as a minister to a congregation outside of Atlanta, and before that, I was a full-time seminary student. The community in which I was immersed was so thoroughly Christian, I sometimes forgot that other people practiced different religions or none at all.</p><p>In this world, there was a kind of cultural Christian lingo that many speak and almost everyone else understands. If someone sneezed, a stranger might say, &#x201c;God bless you.&#x201d; The sneezer would not stop to think, <i>What do you mean by &#x201c;God&#x201d;? Or by &#x201c;bless&#x201d;?</i> If someone mentioned that he had been &#x201c;saved,&#x201d; &#x201c;born again,&#x201d; or &#x201c;attended a Bible-believing church,&#x201d; no follow-up question was needed. On meeting a new acquaintance, Southerners will usually ask <i>where </i>they attend church rather than <i> if</i>.</p><p>I used religious language with ease in the South, rarely pausing to think about the meaning of my words. I grew up surrounded by these syllables of faith, used daily in my home and community. But I was not in Georgia anymore. I penned columns about the intersection of &#x201c;faith and culture&#x201d; from my Southern Christian enclave, but as it turns out, pontificating about a post-Christian society is far easier than living in one.</p><p>In New York, religious fluency is not assumed. The majority of residents don&#x2019;t attend church on any given Sunday, and only about three percent of the population is evangelical Protestant like I was raised. I soon discovered people who had never heard the sacred words I&#x2019;d long taken for granted&#x2014;and others who used them with wildly different meanings.</p><p>I realized this linguistic chasm en route to visit a church in Manhattan on my first Sunday in New York. Waiting on a subway platform, a woman standing next to me asked where I was headed. I explained that I was going to a &#x201c;worship service.&#x201d; She asked for clarification, having never heard that phrase. I clarified that I was new to the city and was going to visit a church. She perked up and said she practiced the Baha'i faith. She held up her crystal amulet necklace and explained that it protected her from evil spirits. If I was spiritually curious, the woman said, she&#x2019;d read my chakra and access the invisible energy fields around my body.</p><p>As we talked about our respective religious practices, it became clear that neither of us understood what the other was saying. I glanced down the dark tunnel in hopes of spotting a train, but rescue wasn&#x2019;t in sight.</p><p>She peppered me with questions about God and the Bible and the afterlife. I fumbled for answers, but what came out didn&#x2019;t make much sense. When I used terms I considered common&#x2014;&#x201c;grace&#x201d; or &#x201c;gospel&#x201d; or &#x201c;salvation&#x201d;&#x2014;my conversation partner stopped me mid-thought to ask for a definition, please. I sputtered, stammered, and stuttered, trying to rephrase those words in ordinary vernacular, but I couldn&#x2019;t seem to articulate their meanings. It was like trying to define the word <i>color </i>or <i>the</i>. Though I had used the terms often, I&#x2019;d never stopped to consider their meanings.</p><p>The train finally slid into the station. I thanked the lady for conversing, though I felt anything but grateful, and bolted down the platform to find a separate train car.</p><p>Not all New Yorkers are like this woman, I came to realize. Others presented a different set of obstacles. Many are familiar with sacred terms but have experienced them as a source of pain or judgment or coercion. In such cases, I often felt embarrassed to speak the vocabulary of faith.</p><p>When a new friend in my co-working space asked me whether I was like the hypocritical Christians he saw on television shamelessly stumping for politicians, I was drenched in shame. But I could understand his contempt.</p><p>The way certain groups of people use sacred words gives the rest of us the holy heebie-jeebies. Holy phrases become tools of manipulation in the hands of angry religious leaders. They are fashioned into clubs by combative evangelists. And when shouted from the mouth of a street preacher outside a football stadium, Scripture becomes downright annoying.</p><p>About a month after I moved to New York City, my new barber asked me what I did for a living.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, I&#x2019;ve never met a religion writer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still pissed off about my childhood. I was raised in the country. My parents were Southern Baptists&#x2014;the hard-core fundamentalist kind. You know anything about those kinds of people?&#x201d;</p><p>He had no idea that I was raised the son of an evangelical minister, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, and I wasn&#x2019;t about to disclose it.</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, what do you think about all that sin and hell and judgment stuff?&#x201d; he pressed.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good question.&#x201d;</p><p>Then I used the ultimate conversation distraction for a New Yorker: &#x201c;You a Yankees or a Mets fan?&#x201d;</p><p>I soon caught onto the pattern emerging in my conversations. Exchanges flowed freely when I stuck to benign topics like the dreaded winter weather or the maddening sound of jackhammers on the street. But the conversation stalled the moment the subject turned spiritual.</p><p>To avoid having to define every sacred term, I swept them into a pile and out the door. Not wanting to be associated with those in society who spoke God fluently but irresponsibly, I started avoiding spiritual conversations altogether.</p><p>I am not alone. I&#x2019;ve been meeting people from all over, with similar histories of belief, who feel they too have been struck mute in a strange land. Terms like <i>sin </i>and <i>hell </i>have become so negative they lodge in our throats. Others, like <i>belief </i>and <i>salvation </i>have been uttered so often we don&#x2019;t know what they mean anymore. Definitions and connotations of words like <i>mercy </i>and <i>love </i>can no longer be assumed.</p><p>An acquaintance of mine, Kyle, is a high school pastor in the Midwest. He tells me that he struggles to motivate his students to talk about God outside of church. The issue for them, Kyle says, isn&#x2019;t a lack of courage. They aren&#x2019;t afraid of being rejected or ostracized by nonreligious friends. Rather, they lack confidence in the words they&#x2019;ve been given. They aren&#x2019;t totally sure what the words mean or whether they believe they are as true as they once thought. And many in this generation have seen the hypocrisy of words not backed up by authentic actions, which causes them to pause.</p><p>Kyle&#x2019;s students may feel a pang of guilt for keeping quiet about sacred matters, but as it turns out, their elders are just as mute, if not more so.</p><p>Partnering with the Barna Group, a prominent social research firm focused on religion in America, I commissioned a national survey of more than 1,000 people to shine some light on this matter. The survey revealed that millions of Americans&#x2014;more than half of them, actually&#x2014;are not speaking God often.</p><p>More than one-fifth of respondents admit they have not had a spiritual conversation <i>at all</i> in the last year. Six-in-ten say they only had a spiritual conversation on rare occasions&#x2014;either &#x201c;once or twice&#x201d; (29 percent) or &#x201c;several times&#x201d; (29 percent) in the last year. An additional 14 percent are more spiritually vocal&#x2014;claiming to have had a spiritual conversation between ten and fifty times in the last year.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the shocker: Despite widespread religiosity, a paltry 7 percent of Americans say they talk about spiritual matters on about a once-per-week basis (more than fifty times in the past year). That means that for most of us, our conversations almost never address the spirituality we claim as important.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not the only significant revelation. Political conservatives are about twice as likely as liberals to have had more than fifty conversations (10 percent versus 5 percent). More conservatives claim religious faith than do liberals, and this faith bubbles up in their conversations more often. However, liberals are still more apt to have spiritual conversations than those who claim &#x201c;somewhere in between&#x201d; as a political ideology&#x2014;this moderate group is twice as likely as either liberals or conservatives to say they &#x201c;never&#x201d; have those conversations (29 percent compared to 14 percent and 16 percent, respectively). Moderates, it would seem, are more likely to keep conversations neutral, avoiding hot topics like religion and politics.</p><p>When it comes to practicing Christians who attend church regularly, I expected the frequency of spiritual conversations to skyrocket. But I was wrong, wrong, wrong. Only 13 percent of practicing Christians had a spiritual conversation more than fifty times last year, which again, would be about once per week. That means only about one in eight self-identifying Christians speak God with regular frequency.</p><p>All this may sound depressing to religious leaders and spiritual seekers, but here is the surprising silver lining: Younger generations are having <i>more </i>spiritual conversations than older generations. In fact, Millennials are having more conversations about religion or spirituality than any other generation.</p><p>The older you are, the less likely it is that you will have a spiritual conversation. Thirty-five percent of Elders say they &#x201c;never&#x201d; had a conversation with someone in the last year, compared to a steadily decreasing percentage from Boomers (29 percent) to Gen Xers (20 percent) to Millennials (10 percent). This trend holds true on the other end of the spectrum: Millennials are the most likely to have had between 10 and 50 conversations in the last year (18 percent compared to 11 percent of Boomers).</p><p>This renewed interest in spiritual matters among young people creates an opportunity to revive sacred speech.</p><p>Reviewing this data roused the wrangler spirit in me once more. I decided to discover why people had lost confidence in the vocabulary of faith and what, if anything, could be done to revive it. What I uncovered proved to be shocking, awakening, and transformative.</p><p>Perhaps sometimes you struggle to speak God like I did. You don&#x2019;t need to move to New York City, or any other urban context, to feel this tension. The world is changing from top to bottom and east to west. Our lives are now saturated with people who differ from us in race, religion, age, education, and cultural mores.</p><p>In neighborhoods across America, people don&#x2019;t read from the same script or work with a common spiritual vocabulary. So you may feel the pinch whether you&#x2019;re living in a Rocky Mountain mining town or a Great Plains farm community, in a bungalow overlooking the ocean or an HOA-friendly house in the suburbs. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether you&#x2019;ve been fluent in the vocabulary of faith since you were old enough to eat solid food or have never learned your religious ABCs.</p><p>Millions of Americans now struggle to find sacred language that can adequately describe life&#x2019;s deeper truths. Perhaps you&#x2019;ve run into this awkward language barrier in recent days.</p><p>Maybe you were spoon-fed religious words since infancy but now wonder, as you&#x2019;ve matured, whether many of those terms need to mature too.</p><p>Maybe you once believed that accepting faith meant praying certain words but now you know better.</p><p>Maybe you formerly assumed that using particular words and avoiding others somehow increased your spiritual standing.</p><p>Maybe the rigid...</p></p><h2>Once &amp; Future</h2><p><b>King Arthur as you've never imagined!

Social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the outcomes of such revolutions. It develops a rigorous, comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, Skocpol urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to explanations of revolutions.</p><p>Theda Skocpol shows how state structures, international forces, and class relations combine to explain the origins and accomplishments of social-revolutionary transformations.

One is a charismatic and passionate political activist determined to win Irish independence from Great Britain at any cost, who appeals to her warrior's soul. The other is the wealthy and handsome black sheep of the pacifist family who owns the mill where she works, and whose persistent attention becomes impossible for her to ignore.</p><p><strong>Patricia Falvey</strong> was born in Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland.

Brainwashed fanatics? Out-of-touch dogmatists? Buffoons? The task of bearing faithful witness to Jesus is complicated by persistent&#x2015;and not altogether baseless&#x2015;cultural stereotypes. In our post-Christian society, thoughtful Christians are considering again how to engage the dominant culture as a minority, a counterpublic, amid varying perceptions and misperceptions. In this timely book, Timothy Muehlhoff and Rick Langer ask what our interactions with the dominant cultural ethos should look like. How might we be persuasive and civil at the same time? How should we respond to those who ridicule and caricature us? How can we challenge the beliefs of other communities with love and respect? Muehlhoff and Langer present a model for cultural engagement that integrates communication theory, theology, and Scripture. Penetrating, wise, and relentlessly practical, it includes test cases and examples from history, such as William Wilberforce and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Now more than ever, Christians need what <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> offers: a compelling vision of public engagement that is both shrewd and gracious.</p><p>Tim Muehlhoff (PhD, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) is a professor of communication at Biola University in La Mirada, California, where he teaches classes in family communication, interpersonal communication, persuasion, and gender. He is the author of <em>I Beg to Differ</em> and <em>Marriage Forecasting</em>, and the coauthor of <em>The God Conversation: Using Stories and Illustrations to Explain Your Faith</em> and <em>Authentic Communication: Christian Speech Engaging Culture</em>. Muehlhoff and his wife, Noreen, are frequent speakers at FamilyLife Marriage Conferences, and Tim also serves as a speaker/author with Biola's Center for Marriage and Relationships."In a world marked more by incivility and talking past each other than respectful engagement, <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> is a refreshing consideration of how to pursue genuine engagement with those with whom we may have deep ideological and theological differences. Tim Muehlhoff and Richard Langer speak not just from a theoretical perspective but from the lived experience of engaging those with opposing views as bearing the <em>imago Dei</em>&#x2015;the image of God&#x2015;and therefore being worthy to be seen as our neighbors, to be treated with dignity and respect. This is a great resource for all of us seeking to be the presence of Christ in the world." (Carol A. Taylor, president of Evangel University)<br><br>"After more than twenty-five years of working with college students in campus ministry, I would argue that students living in a 'post-discourse' society need all the help they can get with learning to engage others in meaningful discussion&#x2015;and not just students, but everyone who desires connections with other humans that go beneath the surface. Read this book as a prayer for change in your own life and in the lives of our communities." (Ed Uszynski, Athletes in Action, Cru)<br><br>"Looking for a manual on winning arguments and scoring points in the current cultural debates? Keep looking! <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> is not the culture warrior's guide to winning. If, however, you hope to learn how to listen well and be heard, how to speak truth irenically, with more light than heat, keep reading. Deeply rooted in contemporary communication theory and ancient biblical wisdom, this excellent work is a wise and effective guide to speaking truth in love. For anyone who hopes to be truly persuasive in our polarized context, Muehlhoff and Langer serve as faithful guides to the work that's required to gain a hearing, to speak effectively, and to create the best possible relational environment for our words to have an impact." (J. Michael Thigpen, executive director of the Evangelical Theological Society, associate professor of Old Testament and Semitics, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University)<br><br>"Muehlhoff and Langer have produced a book well worth the time of any Christian who wants to be real salt and light in a difficult, pluralistic world. To be sure, not only is <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> grounded wonderfully in the Scriptures and current communication theory, but the writing is crisp, the examples and illustrations are entrancing, and the usefulness is immediate and profound. This is the perfect book for church leaders and thoughtful laypersons to read and study together." (Craig J. Hazen, director of the graduate program in Christian apologetics, Biola University, author of Five Sacred Crossings)<br><br>"This is an amazing book! Muehlhoff and Langer merge the best of rhetorical theory, biblical witness, and the stories of caring members in Christian counterpublics who have transformed their communities. It's not a book for those who argue, accuse, or insist that 'my way is Yahweh.' Instead, the authors model what they advocate: winsome persuasion." (Em Griffin, author of A First Look at Communication Theory)<br><br>"<em>Winsome Persuasion</em> could not be a more timely book! In our increasingly hostile and fractured world, followers of Jesus are needed who embrace their role as peacemakers and ministers of reconciliation. But how? Muehlhoff and Langer are incredibly helpful in that regard. This book shows us what cultural engagement can look like; wise, honest, compassionate, and helpful discourse is more important now than ever. Weaving together strands of multiple disciplines, <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> is a rare book that more than delivers on its title. Highly, highly recommended." (Mike Erre, author of Astonished)<br><br>"The American public square is now more cantankerous and less civil than perhaps any time in the modern era. How should a Christian live and speak hope without merely adding more noise? Muehlhoff and Langer's book <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> casts a positive vision for a way forward and indeed models it. This is a book whose time has come." (Jonathan Merritt, contributing writer for The Atlantic, author of Jesus Is Better Than You Imagined)<br><br>"In this age of shrill and often hateful public rhetoric, Muehlhoff and Langer's <em>Winsome Persuasion</em> is a breath of fresh air; wise, warm-hearted, and well researched, its advice for speaking Christianly in the public square could not be more timely." (Thomas M. Crisp, professor of philosophy, Biola University)<br><br>"Following the presidential election of 2016, it was declared that we are now living in a 'post-truth' world. With the dominance of social media where echo chambers are nearly unavoidable and the rise of 'fake news'&#x2015;which once would have been cast aside as nothing more than a gossip rag&#x2015;is being used as evidence to support belief claims, what do people who claim absolute truth do to maintain active participation in the culture while maintaining a level of personal integrity that does not feed into the worst of stereotypes? In <em>Winsome Persuasion</em>, Tim Muehlhoff and Rick Langer present both the challenge and a plan for how Christians can regain credibility and speak persuasively into a world that they no longer recognize as their own. This is not a book that just lays out a problem and provides lament to the believer. Rather, it's a strategy for action. Christians do not have to be victims of an increasingly secular society, nor do we have to become the angry, hate-filled rhetors we have been portrayed to be. How we talk about the issues of our day matters. If we as Christians want to be more than political and social pawns, engaging in winsome persuasion may be the best way to present the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ while creating space to be heard and taken seriously."

Yates II, rector, The Falls Church Anglican)</p><h2>The Neon Lawyer</h2><p><p>With money and hope in short supply, newly minted attorney Brigham Theodore decides it&#x2019;s time to lower his standards. He joins a seedy fly-by-night firm in Salt Lake City out of desperation. After he loses his first case&#x2014;a speeding ticket&#x2014;he&#x2019;s convinced his career is over. But to his shock, his boss hands him a slightly more complex case: capital murder.</p><p>Brigham&#x2019;s new client is Amanda Pierce, a lost, exhausted woman who gunned down the man who tortured and killed her six-year-old daughter. A jury may prove sympathetic to her unbearable pain, but the law is no fan of vigilante justice&#x2014;and neither is Vince Dale, the slick and powerful prosecutor who&#x2019;s never lost a murder case. There&#x2019;s no question that Amanda pulled the trigger&#x2014;she did it in front of five witnesses. If she pleads guilty, she will avoid a death sentence, but saving her life this way comes with an admission that what she did was wrong. However, if she refuses the &#x201c;guilty&#x201d; label, Brigham will have no choice but to fight for his career&#x2014;and Amanda&#x2019;s life.</p><p><b>Revised edition: This edition of <i>The Neon Lawyer</i> includes editorial revisions.</b></p></p><p><p>Victor Methos was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and lived in Pakistan and Iran before permanently settling in the United States.

The New Testament church is a unique institution of divine origin. The systematic study of Scripture reveals that Christianity is ordered after a pattern and possess a distinct identity: designed by the Lord, conveyed through the words of the apostles, and seen in the practice of early Christians. Only when following this pattern can we fulfill the command to glorify God in the church. In this study, Edward C. Wharton establishes that Scripture contains a divine pattern for the church of Christ. He then presents a systematic study of the biblical passages relating to the church, creating a clear understanding of the pattern set by God.</p><p></p><h2>Into Nature: A Creative Field Guide and Journal&#x2015;Unplug and Reconnect with What Matters</h2><p><b>Go beyond forest bathing with 70 mindful ways to unleash your creativity and reconnect with nature </b><br><br> Squeezing mindfulness into every day may seem impossible&#x2014;but it only takes a few moments to go <i>Into Nature</i>.

I was on my second Venti-size refill. Outside, a sea of pedestrians weaved hurriedly around the nearly stationary pillars of tourists who clogged the sidewalks gawking at tall buildings and dazzled by lights. It struck me that even Starbucks is different in New York City. It adapts to keep up with the intensity. Customers move as if on an assembly line, shouting complex orders of made-up coffee names while maintaining conversations on their earpieces and simultaneously checking their smartphones.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dave and I sat by the window. He&#x2019;d asked me to meet him here to talk about problems he was having at work. He wanted my advice, he said. But our conversation quickly turned to a discussion about the unhappy state of his family and then to himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dave was my college buddy. Back in the day, if I were a betting man I would have bet the house that Dave would be running the world by the time he was 40. He wasn&#x2019;t just smart; he was&nbsp;<i>mad</i>&nbsp;smart. He also happened to be good-looking, athletic, and comfortable being the center of attention. Yet now, as he approached his 40th birthday, his life was unraveling. His job as a Wall Street banker had stalled, his marriage was on the rocks, and his three kids&#x2014;well, let&#x2019;s just say he might still have a chance with his youngest.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had achieved what so many people consider &#x201c;the dream,&#x201d; complete with a picture-perfect family, a beautiful home, a distinguished career, and season tickets to his favorite team. Yet now,&nbsp;to him, it felt like it was all falling apart. Dave came to me trying to help plug a hole in what seemed like the breaking of a dam.<br><br> What he didn&#x2019;t realize was that he already had the power to not only to plug the hole, but stop the crumbling altogether; to build a much stronger, more powerful dam, complete with a turbine to reenergize everything he wanted out of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> The question he needed to answer first, though, was: &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;To make more money, to improve my marriage, to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I cut him off. I didn&#x2019;t want to hear some recitation of&nbsp;<i>everyone&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp;life goals. &#x201c;Can you dig a little deeper?&#x201d; I pushed. &#x201c;Stop saying the things you are supposed to say. You have so much and yet so little. You have what looks like a really great life, and you&#x2019;re miserable.&nbsp;<i>Why</i>? What is it you really want but don&#x2019;t have?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Silence.<br> &nbsp;<br> With all of my training as an attorney, I have a hard time letting silence linger, especially when I sense weakness. But I let it sit there as the lightning-paced world around us seemed to fade away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he finally said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your problem,&#x201d; I responded, smiling as if I had just helped him.<br> &nbsp;<br> We wouldn&#x2019;t come to an answer that day. The noise of the crowd rushed back in, and the conversation ended with Dave feeling rather deflated. I promised we would follow up. I told him he had made a great start. Admitting that he didn&#x2019;t know what he wanted and that he didn&#x2019;t really know how to fix any of his problems was the start of a great journey for him&#x2014;a journey that I would gladly help him complete.<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew it was better for him to be deflated and&nbsp;<i>real</i>&nbsp;than to keep up the charade he&#x2019;d kept up for so long.<br> &nbsp;<br> The thing is, I&#x2019;ve had this same conversation with dozens of&nbsp;friends and acquaintances in recent years. In fact, I&#x2019;m guessing I could pull any random person out of almost any Starbucks line in the world, sit them down, and have nearly the same conversation with them, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as I&#x2019;m pretty sure I could have a similar conversation with you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Welcome to life in the modern world: a world in which most people have more wealth, knowledge, and technology (not to mention access to untold amounts of fresh-brewed coffee) than their ancestors could have ever dreamed for themselves. A world in which we have so much but so little. A world in which we seem to have it all, except for the ability to process it. A world in which we are constantly reaching for something, yet never seem to catch it&#x2014;because we&#x2019;re not even sure what &#x201c;it&#x201d; is.<br> &nbsp;<br> A world in which we are perpetually unsatisfied.<br> &nbsp;<br> How bad have things become? The symptoms could hardly be more evident: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the prescribing of antidepressants has risen nearly 400 percent since 1988.1&nbsp;More than 10 percent of Americans over age 12 take an antidepressant.2&nbsp;That means more than one in 10 of us are taking a pill just to get through the day. And the fact is, more than 66 percent of severely depressed people aren&#x2019;t even included in that number, because they aren&#x2019;t taking antidepressants at all.3<br> &nbsp;<br> Those are huge numbers, and yet I would argue that there are far more of us walking around with a feeling that makes those numbers seem small. There&#x2019;s a pervasive sense of malaise in the developed world&#x2014;a sense of worry, of dread, of fear, of helplessness, of an inability to find the capacity to change or to feel better or to get out of our own way that all adds up to something bordering on, or perhaps even surpassing, what we colloquially define as depression.<br> &nbsp;<br> So if you thought it was just you feeling this way, I hope there&#x2019;s&nbsp;some solace in knowing it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s all of us. This problem is not just personal or communal&#x2014;it&#x2019;s societal.<br> &nbsp;<br> The world has developed so rapidly since the late 1980s that it seems impossible to take it all in. Our access to&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;has exploded. Health and wealth have increased significantly. Meanwhile, crime and poverty, have decreased. <br> According to every indicator, we should be overwhelmed with happiness. There is still pain and suffering in the world, of course, but compared to life 25 years ago, let alone a hundred or a thousand years ago, we are doing great.<br> &nbsp;<br> So why are we less happy, less satisfied, more fed up, and far less enthused about our day-to-day existence than ever before?<br> &nbsp;<br> WE ARE ENTERING A NEW ERA Decades from now, we&#x2019;ll look back and recognize that this period we&#x2019;re in is one of the most transformative in human history&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re a part of it, whether you like it or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are in the midst of experiencing the shift to a digital age, a massive technological revolution that has transformed the way we interact with each other and the world around us. The fact that we have life-changing computing and telecommunications power in tiny devices that we carry in our pockets is incredible, but just as the Industrial Revolution brought all kinds of strife and challenge, this technological revolution is bringing new challenges with it as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> In previous generations, wisdom was generally gained through a combination of hard work and time&#x2014;whether that meant going to school or taking an apprenticeship or gaining years of experience simply by living and working in the brave new world. Now, information is available at every single moment and all at once. It&#x2019;s so much, so fast, that we can&#x2019;t possibly take it all in. What we&#x2019;re experiencing, then, is a breadth of information combined with a&nbsp;lack of depth. When we&#x2019;re able to access everything immediately, yet rarely get a chance to go deeper than the surface, that creates a massive problem. As the poet T.S. Eliot once said, &#x201c;Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?&#x201d;4<br> &nbsp;<br> The superficiality of information is actually acting as an inoculation against wisdom. We&nbsp;<i>think</i>&nbsp;that we have all the knowledge we need when, in fact, we really don&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;re distracted all the time. We fall prey to the myth of multitasking (more on this in&nbsp;Chapter 12). When searching for knowledge, we&#x2019;ll read a quote or a maxim, hear someone&#x2019;s opinion and even gather a limited explanation but won&#x2019;t invest the time needed to fully understand any of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Think about this: Everywhere you look these days, you&#x2019;re bombarded by information that&#x2019;s designed to make you feel better. Feel-good Facebook memes, good-news websites and Twitter feeds, and self-help philosophies on positivity abound. You have access to all of it, 24/7 if you so desire. But is any of it truly making you feel better deep down where it counts? Even though the information offers some essential truth, I think most of us recognize that quick fixes and surface-level mantras don&#x2019;t work as a permanent solution. Even if they pick you up, there&#x2019;s always something that comes along and knocks you back down. And the more often that happens, whether you realize it or not, the more you begin to give up.<br> &nbsp;<br> And&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;is what leaves us perpetually unsatisfied: when we think we&#x2019;ve tried everything and read everything and seen everything, and we still don&#x2019;t feel good. So we give up on believing that we ever will.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our need to find satisfaction in life is overwhelming. And in truth, finding that satisfaction comes from doing deep, real work. There is no quick fix for lasting contentment. Unlike getting a quick hit of happiness from a short-term distraction, true satisfaction requires investing a little more time and a little more&nbsp;effort into figuring out what&#x2019;s underneath all of these basic, intuitive bits of information that now flood our screens and our minds.<br> &nbsp;<br> What we lack right now&#x2014;and the thing that I aim to give you in these pages&#x2014;is something that is fundamental to our existence: the ability to process your own life.<br> &nbsp;<br> You already have all the ingredients for happiness, satisfaction and success. You do. We&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;do. The problem is that you don&#x2019;t know what to do with them. It&#x2019;s like having a refrigerator full of raw ingredients but not knowing how to cook. Staring at, discussing, and even touching the ingredients won&#x2019;t satisfy your hunger. It can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s not edible until you learn what to do with it.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that hunger you feel in your life is not something small. That desire to be happy, fulfilled, and empowered&#x2014;that desire is&nbsp;<i>existential</i>. That&#x2019;s why we all keep trying to get to it. You might think that hard work will get you there, so you work harder. You see other people smiling and assume they&#x2019;re satisfied, so you try to be like them. It doesn&#x2019;t work. And again, if you do that often enough, you&#x2019;re bound to give up and resign yourself to thinking you will never satisfy that hunger yourself. (That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re likely skeptical even as you read this.)<br><br> What if I told you that in order to get what you want, to achieve that sense of life satisfaction, all you need to do is change your relationship to what you already have? What if I told you there&#x2019;s a &#x201c;golden lever&#x201d; that allows you to bridge the gap between the life you have and the life you want? And all that is required in order for you to learn how to operate that lever is to understand yourself a little better&#x2014;to read an operating manual, as it were, on how we actually function as human beings?<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, it&#x2019;s true. The golden lever exists. I&#x2019;ve spent my entire adult life in pursuit of it and in pursuit of the understanding of how that lever works. And guess what? I&#x2019;ve found answers, most of which were right there in front of me the whole time. But as you&#x2019;ll soon&nbsp;learn, sometimes the things that are right in front of us are the hardest to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fact is, most of us have failed to put in the work it takes to fully understand who we are. Most of us have no idea how to take advantage of all that life has to offer, because no one has showed us how.<br> &nbsp;<br> That is what I would like to show you.<br> &nbsp;<br> I suppose that leads us right back to the big question, the one that left my buddy Dave completely stumped:&nbsp;<i>What do you want?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Truly, deep down, what is it that&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;want?<br> &nbsp;<br> You don&#x2019;t have to answer that question quite yet. You need to learn a few things first so you can gain the wisdom that&#x2019;s needed to answer that question and then to understand how to implement the changes you seek.<br> &nbsp;<br> So I hope you&#x2019;ll indulge me. I hope you&#x2019;ll be willing to invest a little time to take this journey with me. Because as you&#x2019;re about to see, not only are you capable of achieving the life you want, you are also capable&#x2014;we&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;are capable&#x2014;of all sorts of amazing things that at first seem, quite frankly, beyond belief.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>My Father&#39;s Wake: How the Irish Teach Us to Live, Love, and Die</h2><p><b>An intimate, lyrical look at the ancient rite of the Irish wake--and the Irish way of overcoming our fear of death<br><br></b>Death is a whisper for most of us. Instinctively we feel we should dim the lights, pull the curtains, and speak softly. But on a remote island off the coast of Ireland's County Mayo, death has a louder voice.<br><br>Each day, along with reports of incoming Atlantic storms, the local radio runs a daily roll call of the recently departed. The islanders go in great numbers, young and old alike, to be with their dead. They keep vigil with the corpse and the bereaved company through the long hours of the night. They dig the grave with their own hands and carry the coffin on their own shoulders. The islanders cherish the dead--and amid the sorrow, they celebrate life, too.<br><br>In <i>My Father's Wake</i>, acclaimed author and award-winning filmmaker Kevin Toolis unforgettably describes his own father's wake and explores the wider history and significance of this ancient and eternal Irish ritual. Perhaps we, too, can all find a better way to deal with our mortality--by living and loving as the Irish do.<br></p><p><b>Kevin Toolis</b> is a writer and BAFTA-winning filmmaker. The author of a celebrated chronicle of Ireland's Troubles,<i> Rebel Hearts: Journeys within the IRA's Soul</i>, he has written for the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>The Guardian</i> and reported on conflicts around the world. His family has lived in the same village on an island off the coast of County Mayo for the last two hundred years. Toolis makes his home on the island and in London."The windswept Irish island of <i>My Father's Wake</i> is one of the final remote outposts of true death engagement in the Western world. Toolis's book is both memoir and anthropology, and serves as a refreshing counterpoint to the industrialized, for-profit death industry we've come to wrongly believe is our only option."--Caitlin Doughty, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Smoke Gets in Your Eyes </i>and <i>From Here to Eternity<br></i><br><br>"As a boy, he learned to kiss the corpse at a traditional island wake. As a filmmaker and witness to death in many conflict zones around the world, Kevin Toolis has written a profound book on the culture of grief and death, placing the personal alongside the political in a vivid exploration of our ancient ways of coming together around the dead. This is a moving family story, a memoir of loss and exile, a deep understanding of what makes us alive, casting a cold eye on what is precious and so often denied."--<b>Hugo Hamilton</b><br><br>"The 'Western Death Machine' has hidden the dead and dying, but in a remote island off the west coast of Ireland, an almost Homeric society clings to the old ways. The dying are treasured and tenderly watched over, the dead are honored with the ancient rites and rituals. Contemporary western ideas about death are dominated by individualism; <i>My Father's Wake</i> is a lyrical description of how community and tradition help us deal with our mortality."--<b>Seamus O'Mahony</b>, author of <i>The Way We Die Now<br></i><br><br>"A heartwarming and very personal account of a life well-lived."<i>--<b>Irish Times</b></i><br><br>"A long meditation on death, dying, and our attitudes to mortality--our own and others'.... Toolis posits an acceptance of the inevitable which, while it does not banish the pain of grief, invests it with a resignation and a grace that is, in essence, healing and somehow life-affirming."--<b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>"A gut-wrenching exploration of death from an Irish perspective...A fascinating view of what most of us try not to consider: the end of life...This book is not for the faint of heart, as the experiences [Toolis] shares will leave readers emotionally raw.

The dead are called Histories, and the vast realm in which they rest is the Archive. Da first brought Mackenzie Bishop here four years ago, when she was twelve years old, frightened but determined to prove herself. Now Da is dead, and Mac has grown into what he once was: a ruthless Keeper, tasked with stopping often-violent Histories from waking up and getting out. Because of her job, she lies to the people she loves, and she knows fear for what it is: a useful tool for staying alive.<br><br>Being a Keeper isn't just dangerous-it's a constant reminder of those Mac has lost. Da's death was hard enough, but now that her little brother is gone too, Mac starts to wonder about the boundary between living and dying, sleeping and waking. In the Archive, the dead must never be disturbed. And yet, someone is deliberately altering Histories, erasing essential chapters. Unless Mac can piece together what remains, the Archive itself might crumble and fall.<br><br>In this haunting, richly imagined novel, Victoria Schwab reveals the thin lines between past and present, love and pain, trust and deceit, unbearable loss and hardwon redemption.</p><p><strong>Victoria Schwab</strong> (www.VictoriaSchwab.com) is the author of several novels, including, <i>The Near Witch</i>-which <i>Kirkus</i> praised for its "shivery horror tang" and "extraordinary sense of place"-and <i>The Archived</i>, of which <i>The Horn Book</i> said "[Schwab] writes of death, sorrow, and family love with a light, intelligent touch and inventive vigor, and provides romance with a pleasing edge of unpredictability." When she is not wandering through foreign countries, Victoria can usually be found tucked in the corner of a coffee shop in Nashville, sipping tea and dreaming of monsters.Gr 9 Up-Mackenzie was just 11 when her Da passed along the heavy responsibility of being a "Keeper": one in charge of returning Histories to the Archive. A History is a sort of ghost, but more like a copy of a dead person's life. Librarians keep every History on a shelf, in a complex and rigid order. But every once in a while one slips (becomes restless and crazed) and escapes the orderly Archive into the chaos of the Narrows-a lightless series of corridors filled with doors. A Keeper's role is to return the Histories to the Archive lest they escape into the real world. When her family moves to an old hotel turned apartment building called the Coronado after the tragic death of her beloved little brother, Mac's workload of wandering Histories begins increasing exponentially. Plus, she meets a strange-looking Goth guy named Wes who shocks her by confessing that he, too, is a Keeper, and she begins to bond with him. Soon the ordered quiet of the Archive is booming with the noise of escaped Histories, and there appears to be a saboteur. Mac uncovers a dark secret held in the walls of the Coronado. Something terrible happened there and great lengths have been taken to cover it up. Stranger still is Owen, whom Mac encounters in the Narrows, a History who is not on her list and somehow has not yet slipped. Schwab skillfully manages that rare accomplishment: a spine-tingling, supernatural, ghostly mystery that is fully believable.

He teaches at Boston University and is the poetry editor at <i>Slate</i>.The Best of the Best American Poetry INTRODUCTION<p></p> The Centrality of Poetry<p></p> <br>by Robert Pinsky<br> <br><br> <br>My assignment has been to choose one hundred poems from the nearly two thousand selected by the poets who edited the annual Best American Poetry volumes over the past twenty-five years. An intimidating task: just look at the anthologies of even a generation or two ago, with their surprising omissions and mistaken inclusions&#x2014;in hindsight. See, too, the lists of prizewinners and poets laureate.<br> <br>William Shakespeare, John Donne, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, and Gerard Manley Hopkins were ignored or underestimated by experts of their times. Present-day scholars and critics, the equivalents of those experts, now write books about those poets.<br> <br>On the other hand, I have the encouraging thought that the editors of the annual volumes in the series, from John Ashbery in 1988 to Mark Doty in 2012, are poets. And poets, though certainly not infallible in judgment, have a stringent, in a way ruthless motive or framework for judgment, distinct from the more curatorial role of scholars and critics. Actual composition, the effort to make something new, is a fiery, inherently disruptive form of criticism.<br> <br>Who, after all, called attention to the once-neglected work of Donne and Hopkins? Mainly, subsequent generations of poets. More recently, Elizabeth Bishop and George Oppen, during their lives, were not as widely celebrated as James Dickey and Archibald MacLeish. But in time, young poets decided they needed to learn from Bishop and Oppen.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s posterity ever done for me?&#x201d; Groucho Marx is said to have asked. In poetry, the answer is clear: posterity chooses. The new poets to come are the arbiters of what is best, or at least what is recognized as best in their time. Even their mistakes may be illuminating, because of the energy that drives them. The maker&#x2019;s pressure, the craving to make something new and good, exerts a greater force for the artist than schools, categories, expectations&#x2014;greater, and sometimes in an opposite direction, toward surprise or defiance. In each generation, the practitioners for their own purposes revise that forever shape-shifting and evolving organism, the canon.<br> <br>What has been my basis for choosing the poems in this book? A short answer would be: ear and imagination. Those are the prerequisites. But beyond that, there is&#x2014;not subject matter, exactly, but a large and adventuresome sense of subject matter: in one form or another, an implicit idea of poetry, the art of the individual human voice, as central and fundamental: like singing, dancing, cuisine, ceremony. In a word, culture.<br> <br>By &#x201c;ear&#x201d; I mean the way poetry&#x2019;s medium is breath: the art is rooted in the human-scale, extremely intimate yet social medium of each reader&#x2019;s actual or imagined voice. The reader imagines what it might feel like to need to say the poem. By &#x201c;imagination&#x201d; I mean an act of mind that is similarly individual, on a human scale. At the juncture of imagination and body, poetry like dance and song is central to human culture, in the mysterious fusion at the core of mind and body. With imagination, mind expresses itself in gesture and sound. Breath, the medium (for me) of poetry, is literally at the center of the human body, inhaling and exhaling. As speech is a fundamental social means, poetry based on speech is a fundamental art.<br> <br>By &#x201c;culture&#x201d; I mean something distinct from the two realms that are sometimes assumed to encompass all of culture: the entertainment industry and the academic industry. Both are constituent parts of something larger and deeper, and yet often&#x2014;maybe because it is less visible than the curriculum or the TV Guide&#x2014;underestimated. Culture generates the curriculum and the TV Guide, and incorporates elements of them, and shrugs them aside, like the god Kronos eating his children. The underestimation of culture may have roots in the fearsome truth that culture is not ornamental and static; that it is an unsettling, tectonic force, not always benign. Sometimes it is sinister or appalling. It cannot reliably be predicted or manipulated.<br> <br>In February 2007, in the state of Qatar, I attended a Brookings Institution conference, the U.S.-Islamic World Forum: &#x201c;Confronting What Divides Us.&#x201d; Along with people from the media, politics, science, and business there were some representatives from the arts, religion, and media, designated under the rubric of &#x201c;Culture.&#x201d; A session of our cultural group included an Arabic pop singer, a comedian, and a graphic-novel artist, along with on-air and online journalists and&#x2014;notably&#x2014;experts in the world of the Internet: social media and digital entertainment, and the merging of the two. Our seminar&#x2019;s moderator emphasized demographic facts, in particular that the median age throughout the Arab world was very young and getting younger. Combined with the surge in computer skills and access, this demographic change would become increasingly determinative. That was the recurring theme.<br> <br>But an Egyptian playwright protested against this emphasis on demographics. As I remember, she argued passionately that demographics and technology, though significant, should not lead us to neglect the immense force of culture, and of art within culture. The cultural forces within particular nations, religions, and religious groups, she declared, were organic, various, and enduring, as well as constantly evolving. An Egyptian thirteen-year-old and a Kurdish thirteen-year-old were in certain ways profoundly different from each other and from their Bosnian, Iranian, and Yemeni contemporaries, though they might have similar T-shirts and computer games. Culture, she argued, trumps demographics.<br> <br>Against a general, polite tide away from the playwright&#x2019;s viewpoint, I and a few others were moved by her argument. Notably, a Palestinian filmmaker observed that the Koran&#x2019;s power came largely from a matter of art: the fact that it was composed in verses, making it both magnetic and memorizable. I had never thought about this fact, a refutation of the tag from W. H. Auden that &#x201c;poetry makes nothing happen.&#x201d; The Koran has made many things happen.<br> <br>Then, a moment later, an American entrepreneur, representing a website where people engage in alternate lives, said: &#x201c;Everyone in this room is a dinosaur&#x201d;&#x2014;implying that in 2007 there might be something a bit outdated, or even extinct, about the playwright&#x2019;s notions regarding art.<br> <br>Three years later, the Arab Spring uprisings indicated that both sides of that 2007 argument were onto something. Computer literacy among the young and their use of social media enabled large demonstrations, as in Tahrir Square. Regimes that had seemed invulnerable toppled. And though the means of the demonstrators were digital, the meanings they expressed were cultural.<br> <br>The urgency of art, or the art of poetry, with its scale that is at once individual and immense, somehow both dreamy and fundamental, is not easy to formulate. But that urgency is a sense that the ancient art must strive to get to the bottom of things, that a lot is at stake. That implicit dimension of the art, a matter of intensity and scale, was a primary guide as I chose from among the selections made by the poets who preceded me as editors of the annual Best American Poetry volumes.<br> <br>By urgency, I don&#x2019;t mean preaching or mere high-minded sentiments, but rather something like the role for art envisioned by the Modernist predecessors T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, St�phane Mallarm�, and Ezra Pound. Their vision of art shaped my generation, but like others I have come to mistrust the Modernist saying that the poet&#x2019;s mission is to &#x201c;purify the language of the tribe&#x201d;: the political history of the Modernist period and after suggests misgivings about both purity and tribalism as ideals.<br> <br>Many poems honored by the annual volumes in the past twenty-five years seem to embrace that old Modernist largeness of vision, but sometimes in a way opposite to purifying the language of a tribe&#x2014;expanding it and hybridizing it or even mongrelizing it. (In a separate discussion, it&#x2019;s more than arguable that Pound and Eliot in their best poems do the same.) Impurity&#x2014;as variously and gloriously as in Dickinson, Twain, Melville, Whitman&#x2014;has been an urgent, significant part of American writing, reflecting American experience. In a contemporary version of that urgency, poets in the BAP volumes find ways to extend that project: to tell some historical truth grounded in the unique evidence of American speech, and through the intimate, communal, profoundly vocal medium of poetry.<br> <br>In 1994, for example, A. R. Ammons selected a passage from Harryette Mullen&#x2019;s Muse &amp; Drudge, published the next year as a book-length poem. An epigraph from Callimachus (&#x201c;Fatten your animal for sacrifice, poet, / but keep your muse slender.&#x201d;), precedes the first section, which orchestrates different kinds of language within the four athletic quatrains of the opening section, an example of expressive, improvisatory movement, more expressive than mere &#x201c;purity&#x201d;:<br> <br>1.<br> <br>sapphire&#x2019;s lyre styles<br> <br>plucked eyebrows<br> <br>bow lips and legs<br> <br>whose lives are lonely too<br> <br>my last nerve&#x2019;s lucid music<br> <br>sure chewed up the juicy fruit<br> <br>you must don&#x2019;t like my peaches<br> <br>there&#x2019;s some left on the tree<br> <br>you&#x2019;ve had my thrills<br> <br>a reefer a tub of gin<br> <br>don&#x2019;t mess with me I&#x2019;m evil<br> <br>I&#x2019;m in your sin<br> <br>clipped bird eclipsed moon<br> <br>soon no memory of you<br> <br>no drive or desire survives<br> <br>you flutter invisible still<br> <br>If the ancient poet&#x2019;s advice means for the poem to be quick and alert, it is fulfilled by the movement here among idioms, from the blues to the eclipsed moon and back, including points in between. Slavery, pop music, and plucked eyebrows do not preclude the more analytical language of &#x201c;no drive or desire survives.&#x201d; The four syllables of the third line, with their comic double meaning heartbreaking for the character, establish a certain, requisite alertness: a music of Cupid&#x2019;s-bow lips and bowed legs, together, make a jagged chord. The peach-tree image of the blues lyric and the blues syntax, in a similar way, jostle and harmonize with the more literary, also rich music of vowel, consonant, and vocabulary in &#x201c;my last nerve&#x2019;s lucid music,&#x201d; echoed in &#x201c;juicy fruit.&#x201d;<br> <br>That syncretic range of ear and of idea takes a quite different form, yet I think related, in Paul Violi&#x2019;s &#x201c;Counterman&#x201d; from the 2006 volume (ed. Billy Collins), which begins with a deceptive, reportorial meticulousness:<br> <br>&#x2014;What&#x2019;ll it be?<br> <br>Roast beef on rye, with tomato and mayo.<br> <br>&#x2014;Whaddaya want on it?<br> <br>A swipe of mayo.<br> <br>Pepper but no salt.<br> <br>&#x2014;You got it. Roast beef on rye.<br> <br>You want lettuce on that?<br> <br>No. Just tomato and mayo.<br> <br>&#x2014;Tomato and mayo. You got it.<br> <br>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Salt and pepper?<br> <br>No salt, just a little pepper.<br> <br>&#x2014;You got it. No salt.<br> <br>You want tomato.<br> <br>Yes. Tomato. No lettuce.<br> <br>&#x2014;No lettuce. You got it.<br> <br>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No salt, right?<br> <br>Right. No salt.<br> <br>&#x2014;You got it.&#x2014;Pickle?<br> <br>This manic accuracy of dialogue, in itself engaging, turns out to be a slow curve, a deadpan setup for a left turn of the imagination:<br> <br>Right. No pickle.<br> <br>&#x2014;You got it.<br> <br>Next!<br> <br>Roast beef on whole wheat, please,<br> <br>With lettuce, mayonnaise, and a center slice<br> <br>Of beefsteak tomato.<br> <br>The lettuce splayed, if you will,<br> <br>In a Beaux Arts derivative of classical acanthus,<br> <br>And the roast beef, thinly sliced, folded<br> <br>In a multifoil arrangement<br> <br>That eschews Bragdonian pretensions<br> <br>Or any idea of divine geometric projection<br> <br>For that matter, but simply provides<br> <br>A setting for the tomato<br> <br>To form a medallion with a dab<br> <br>Of mayonnaise as a fleuron.<br> <br>And&#x2014;as eclectic as this may sound&#x2014;<br> <br>If the mayonnaise can also be applied<br> <br>Along the crust in a Vitruvian scroll<br> <br>And as a festoon below the medallion,<br> <br>That would be swell.<br> <br>&#x2014;You mean like in the Cathedral St. Pierre in Geneva?<br> <br>Yes, but the swag more like the one below the rosette<br> <br>At the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.<br> <br>&#x2014;You got it.<br> <br>Next!<br> <br>I think this fantastical dialogue&#x2014;precise about Beaux Art acanthus derivatives in the lettuce and equally precise in its rendering of New York deli idiom&#x2014;makes the scene not less real or abundantly rich, but more so. As the two kinds of language intertwine and blend, absurdly yet productively, language itself is not glibly dismissed or deprecated. The enterprise of poetry, implicitly, has its weird majesty. In the meeting of naturalistic speech and New York School elaboration, something large and mysterious transpires.<br> <br>The large reach and intense focus of these passages, embodied vocally, exemplify a certain spirit, for me&#x2014;the contrary of deprecation. Deprecation may have as many modes and varieties as art itself. In contemporary poetry, it can vary between opposites that meet: at one pole, a bland, companionable chuckle that dismisses importance; at the other, a complacent, arbitrary mash-up that dismisses meaning. An easy middlebrow scoff and an easy postmodern smirk. For a keener, more exacting and thrilling form of both comedy and skepticism, see (for instance) Kenneth Koch&#x2019;s &#x201c;Proverb,&#x201d; where the Proverb and the proper names both have their significance, along with a cosmic absurdity. The language is plainer than Mullen&#x2019;s or Violi&#x2019;s, but the spirit is wide-ranging.<br> <br>&#x201c;Les morts vont vite,&#x201d; Koch begins by quoting, &#x201c;et les vivants sont dingues.&#x201d; In his poem&#x2019;s translation, &#x201c;The dead go fast, the next day absent!&#x201d; and &#x201c;the living are haywire.&#x201d; The speed and ardor of his poem, with its amazed, awed laughter, puts the human voice, hovering somewhere between speech and song, at the center of things, evoking in the cadences and patterns of speech the movement of life, encompassing &#x201c;Alexander of Macedon, on time! / Prudhomme on time, Gorbachev on time, the beloved and the lover on time!&#x201d;<br> <br>The large, multiple vision called up by the single human voice feeling the tides and currents of time, from amid them: that notion or force has been a primary guide for me. I have tried to honor its variety. As a closing example, partly for its contrast with Koch&#x2019;s poem, and partly for its consonance, here are the closing lines&#x2014;in a relatively &#x201c;pure&#x201d; idiom, but intensely vocal&#x2014;of Anne Winters&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Mill-Race&#x201d;:<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not a water mill really, work. It&#x2019;s like the nocturnal<br> <br>paper-mill pulverizing, crushing each fiber of rag into atoms,<br> <br>or the smooth-lipped workhouse<br> <br>treadmill, that wore down a London of doxies and sharps,<br> <br>or the paper-mill, fa�rique, that raised the cathedrals and wore out hosts of dust-demons,<br> <br>but it&#x2019;s mostly the miller&#x2019;s curse-gift, forgotten of God yet still grinding, the salt-<br> <br>mill, that makes the sea, salt.<br> <br>I am glad to present the energy and variety of these one hundred poems, culled from the choices of poets over twenty-five years.</p><h2>Welcome to the Book of Common Prayer</h2><p>In this guide for newcomers as well as lifelong Episcopalians, author Vicki Black helps readers navigate the currents of Anglican liturgy and discover its richness and beauty.

His name is Jakob Beer. He is only seven years old. And although by all rights he should have shared the fate of the other Jews in his village, he has not only survived but been rescued by a Greek geologist, who does not recognize the boy as human until he begins to cry. With this electrifying image, Anne Michaels ushers us into her rapturously acclaimed novel of loss, memory, history, and redemption.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Michaels follows Jakob across two continents, she lets us witness his transformation from a half-wild casualty of the Holocaust to an artist who extracts meaning from its abyss. Filled with mysterious symmetries and rendered in heart-stopping prose, <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> is a triumphant work, a book that should not so much be read as it should be surrendered to.</p><p>Anne Michaels, an accomplished poet, has already published two collections of poetry in her native Canada. She turns her hand to fiction in an impressive debut novel, <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>. This is the story of Jakob Beer, a Polish Jew, translator, and poet who, as a child, witnessed his family's slaughter at the hands of the Nazis. Beer himself was found and smuggled out of Poland by Athos Roussos, a Greek archaeologist who carried him back to Greece and kept him there in precarious safety. After the war they emigrated together to Canada. Jakob's story is told through diaries discovered by Ben, a young man whose parents are Holocaust survivors and who is a vessel for their memories just as Jakob is the bearer of his own. <p> <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> is a book about memory and forgetting. How is it possible to love the living when our hearts are still with the dead? What is the difference between what historical fact tells us and what we remember? More than that, the novel is a meditation on the power of language to free our souls and allow us to find our own destinies.</p>"This extraordinarily beautiful novel is a world. A book miraculously created because it mends the hopeless and dances with loss. Trust and read it."<br>-John Berger<br><br>"Anne Michaels has created a world of stunning, heartbreaking clarity where even the unspeakable is captured in the light-web of her words. She is a superb poet, a breath-stopping storyteller."<br>-Cristina Garcia<br><br>"Fugitive Pieces is an utterly mesmerizing novel told from the core of a poet's soul focusing upon our very prosaic world. It does what all great novels do: illuminate through the lights of language and intelligence the heart of a hitherto hidden human landscape."<br>-Chaim Potok<br><br>"Searing the mind with stunning images while seducing with radiant prose, this brilliant first novel is a story of damaged lives and the indestructibility of the human spirit. The novel will make readers yearn to share it with others, to read sentences and entire passages out loud, to debate its message, to acknowledge its wisdom."<br>-Publisher's Weekly<br><br>"A stunning work, quite beautifully written. A moving tale of survival becomes a grave and stately hymn to the revivifying qualities of language and learning."<br>-Kirkus Review<br><br>"There are times when the novel's reflections become as piercing and unsettling as the deep wisdom of saints and visionaries ...

Yet, when a poisonous black tidal wave carries Pig, Fox, and Hippo over the dam and into the wastelands, they don&#x2019;t find death. Instead they find bustling cities, each with their own dams. Pig can't help but wonder, who is the mysterious dam keeper behind it all?</p><p>But he doesn't have time to unravel this mystery. The wave of deadly black fog will return to Sunrise Valley in four days, and its dam can't withstand another assault. In a stolen truck and with a deranged lizard leading the way, Pig and his friends are in a race against the clock. but can they reach home in time?</p></p><p><p>For twelve years, <b>Robert Kondo</b> worked at Pixar as an art director on films like <i>Ratatouille</i>, <i>Toy Story 3</i>, and <i>Monsters University</i>. </p><p><b>Daisuke &#x201c;Dice&#x201d; Tsutsumi</b> has worked as an artist at Blue Sky Studios (<i>Ice Age</i> and<i> Robots</i>) and as an art director at Pixar (<i>Toy Story 3</i> and <i>Monsters University</i>).</p><p>Together, Kondo and Tstutsumi directed the 2015 Oscar-nominated short <i>The Dam Keeper </i>and then founded their own studio, Tonko House.</p>Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Years ago, the fog came over the dam, killing Pig's mother.

Now, every day Pig winds up the windmill that blows away the fog, which always creeps back. The fog is almost its own character as Pig (and readers) tries to understand its mysteries.

Written in graphic-novel format.</p><p>Nathan Olson is a Capstone AuthorA man named Judah had a dream of building a railroad reaching from the West coast to the East coast. He tackled many obstacles and when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 into law, he realized that his dream was going to come true. Unfortunately, Judah died before the railroad became a reality. This book is written in graphic format that is a favorite of mine. The graphic format is perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own. Young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on will also enjoy the graphics and fast paced text. The full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. The author includes a box on most pages with narration giving extra information to the reader to help with comprehension. Vocabulary has been well-selected. This book is an excellent resource that could be used for writing a summary, a book report, or as a source for research. At the end of the book the author includes two pages with more information about the Transcontinental Railroad. I honestly did not know that Chinese laborers had to pull three locomotives and forty train cars for fifteen miles during a blizzard. The author includes a Glossary with a pronunciation guide and a list of other books and web sites that might be of interest to the reader. I highly recommend this book that is part of the Graphic Library series. --Childrens Literature Comprehensive Database, January 2007<br><br>In the mid 1800 s an engineer called Theodore Judah decided that it was time for someone to build a railroad connecting California with the eastern United States. Unfortunately, he could not get the government in Washington D.C. to agree on a railroad bill and therefore he began to try to find private investors to pay for the project. He succeeded in finding four rich and powerful businessmen to launch the Central Pacific Railroad and finally in 1862, he was present when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act. Unfortunately, Judah died soon after this event, but the work on the railroad began and despite many setbacks, the railroad crept its way through the mountains and across the country. Meanwhile, while the Central Pacific worked its way west, a new company, the Union Pacific, was formed to build a railroad that worked its way east. Both companies were rife with highly unethical business practices and the men who were in charge made enormous amounts of money at the expense of the government, at the expense of other investors, and at the expense of the men who worked on the railroad itself. It was an ugly business, but in the end the railroad was completed and the benefit to the country as a whole was enormous. This is an excellent account of how the transcontinental railroad came to be built and how political, corrupt, and complicated the process was. The author takes great pains to make sure that his readers know that the laborers who built the railroad did so working under dreadful and very dangerous conditions. Presented in a graphic novel format, this is one of the many first-rate non fiction titles in the Capstone Press Graphic Library series. --Through the Looking Glass Childrens Book Review, , May 2007</p><h2>Spies, Soldiers, Couriers, &amp; Saboteurs: Women of the American Revolution</h2><p><p>The Revolutionary War has divided the country.

Waldvogel holds a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education and a Master of Science degree in education. She taught fifth grade for four years and eighth grade language arts for ten years. Teaching fifth grade social studies renewed her passion for American history and she began reading as many books as possible on the subject. While doing so, she wondered about the role of women in our country&#39;s fight for independence. Having always enjoyed writing, she decided to merge these two interests and began researching little-known women of the American Revolution. Her reading uncovered many heroic tales by young girls and women. The result of her research is Spies, Soldiers, Couriers, and Saboteurs: Women of the American Revolution.

But when she tried going back to her apartment in Seattle and returning to graduate school, she knew it wasn't possible to resume life as though nothing had happened. So she went to Paris, a city that held vivid memories of a childhood trip with her father, of early morning walks on the cobbled streets of the Latin Quarter and the taste of her first pain au chocolat. She was supposed to be doing research for her dissertation, but more often, she found herself peering through the windows of chocolate shops, trekking across town to try a new p�tisserie, or tasting cheeses at outdoor markets, until one evening when she sat in the Luxembourg Gardens reading cookbooks until it was too dark to see, she realized that her heart was not in her studies but in the kitchen.<p> At first, it wasn't clear where this epiphany might lead. Like her long letters home describing the details of every meal and market, Molly's blog Orangette started out merely as a pleasant pastime. But it wasn't long before her writing and recipes developed an international following. Every week, devoted readers logged on to find out what Molly was cooking, eating, reading, and thinking, and it seemed she had finally found her passion. But the story wasn't over: one reader in particular, a curly-haired, food-loving composer from New York, found himself enchanted by the redhead in Seattle, and their email correspondence blossomed into a long-distance romance.</p><p> In <i>A Homemade Life: Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table</i>, Molly Wizenberg recounts a life with the kitchen at its center. From her mother's pound cake, a staple of summer picnics during her childhood in Oklahoma, to the eggs she cooked for her father during the weeks before his death, food and memories are intimately entwined. You won't be able to decide whether to curl up and sink into the story or to head straight to the market to fill your basket with ingredients for Cider-Glazed Salmon and Pistachio Cake with Honeyed Apricots.</p><p> Explore the reading group guide for <i>A Homemade Life</i>. </p> <p><strong>A Conversation with Author Molly Wizenberg</strong><br><br> </p><p><b>Q:</b> Can you tell us a bit about your life since publishing <i>A Homemade Life</i>? Have there been any special projects, meals, or recipes? Does Seattle still feel like home for both you and Brandon?<br><br> <b>A:</b> It's been busy around here, to say the least! In August of 2009, Brandon and I opened a restaurant. It's called Delancey, and it's in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. It's a Brooklynstyle wood-fired pizzeria, inspired by all the great pies that Brandon grew up eating in New York and New Jersey. A restaurant is probably the last thing that anyone expected of us, given that Brandon is a musician by training, and that I've written quite a bit about how much I dislike (!) working in a restaurant kitchen, but what can you do? He makes a killer pizza. I'm so proud of him.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Do you still enjoy writing your blog, Orangette? Has it changed since you began it in 2004?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I love writing for the blog. Probably more than ever, actually. The blog is where I can be the most spontaneous in my writing, where I can really play. It's also an incredible community. I'm continually blown away by the conversations that crop up in comments, by the people that I've met, by the way it has completely reshaped my life over the past six years. It sounds cheesy, but I mean every word.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> At your book events or through your blog, do readers ever share their own food stories with you? Does one of these stand out in particular?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Absolutely. Talking with readers and hearing their stories has been my favorite part of book events. When I write, I feel as though I'm having a conversation with my readers--only, the thing is, I never actually get to see their faces or hear their voices. Book events give me that chance, and I'm so grateful for it. The fact that food gives us a common ground to meet on, that it gives us something to share--that's what it's all about. Now I'm really sounding cheesy.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Does Paris continue to be a special place for you? Have you been back since the publication of your book?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Paris will always be a special place for me. I haven't been back since the book came out--this year was so busy!--but Brandon and I are hoping to steal away for a trip sometime in 2010. I miss it.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> List three items that are in your refrigerator right now, and what significance they have for you.<br><br> <b>A:</b> Peanut butter--it's not glamorous, but I could eat it every day. I'm pretty sure my body is at least 75 percent peanut butter.<br><br> Maple syrup--this particular jug of syrup was given to me by one of my readers. It came from her trees in upstate New York, and it's fantastic. I don't think there could possibly be a better present than maple syrup from your very own trees.<br><br> Apples from the farmers' market--one of the best parts of living in Washington! There's one stand in particular that has lots of heirloom apples, and they have the best names. Right now, I've got a couple of Black Twigs, one Gold Rush, and a couple of Waltanas.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> In <i>A Homemade Life</i> you write about both of your parents, but there seem to be more stories about your father and his outsized personality. Is there a reason for this?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I needed to write about my father. There were so many details and moments and stories that made up who he was to me, and I didn't want to forget. I needed to write about him to assure myself that I would remember. But I also needed to write about him so that I could start to let go of some of the harder moments of his illness and his death. In putting them down on paper, I got to take them out of my head and store them somewhere else. I didn't know it until I was deep into the book, but I still had a lot of grieving to do, and writing helped me to do it.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Has your relationship with your mother changed in the years since the death of your father?<br><br> <b>A:</b> We were always close, and we still are. But we've become more intentional about spending time together. It's not easy, since we live far apart, but every year, the two of us go away together, just for a few days, and do lots of eating and drinking and catching up.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> From potato salad to Christmas cookies to Hoosier Pie, in the book you describe many recipes that are traditions in your family. Have you and Brandon created any new traditional recipes?<br><br> <b>A:</b> We 're still pretty fixated on Hoosier Pie, to tell you the truth! Old traditions die hard--or however the saying goes. But we're making new ones, too. Slowly but surely I've taken to making the same chocolate layer cake for our birthdays every year, and I get irrationally excited about it. I'm still working on the frosting, though. Maybe this will be my lucky year.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What is your opinion of the slow food movement in this country? Do you believe it is on the rise? How do you think the current economy has or will affect it?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Anything that encourages people to eat more real food and less processed food, to find pleasure in cooking and sharing food, is a great thing.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What are you working on now? Do you have plans to write another book?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Well, I'm into my third year of writing a monthly column for <em>Bon App�tit</em> and my sixth year at Orangette, both of which keep me busy! I'm also the de facto manager / wineglass polisher / baseboard scrubber / errand runner / CFO of Delancey, and that keeps me even busier. (Or crazier, depending on your point of view.) But I do want to write another book, and getting a start on that is my goal for 2010.

It is a magical romance, yet deeply and problematically embedded in seventeenth-century debates about authority and power. In this updated edition, David Lindley has thoroughly revised the introduction and reading list to take account of the latest directions in criticism and performance. Including a new section on casting in recent productions, Lindley&#39;s introduction explores the complex questions this raises about colonization, racial and gender stereotypes, and the nature of the theatrical experience. Careful attention is also given to the play&#39;s dramatic form, stagecraft, and use of music and spectacle, to demonstrate its uniquely experimental nature.</p><p>For this second edition of The Tempest - one of Shakespeare&#39;s most elusive and suggestive plays - David Lindley has thoroughly revised the introduction to take account of the latest developments in criticism and performance. He has also added a completely new section on casting in recent productions of the play.Review of the first edition: 'If you are looking for a model edition - by which I mean one that is concerned to honour the text and to explain the processes involved in editing - this is it. If I were ever again to undertake the editing of a Shakespeare play, I would keep Lindley's edition of The Tempest open beside me.' Peter Thompson<br><br>Review of the first edition: 'David Lindley's [The] Tempest is the best edition on the market and the paperback is a snip.' Studies in Theatre and Performance<br><br>Review of the first edition: 'Lindley aims both to represent and to explain the range of readings given the play in its theatrical and critical afterlives. His edition meets the high standards of the series in an exemplary manner, offering an especially fine introduction that focuses on the elusiveness of The Tempest, a feature that has made it central to late-twentieth-century criticism.' Barbara Hodgdon, Studies in English Literature<br><br>Review of the first edition: 'David Lindley's edition of The Tempest is easily the most outstanding version of this ostensibly straightforward yet hugely teasing play produced over the last thirty years. Its precise and scrupulous commentary notes are careful to the variety of ways the text can be spoken on stage. Its notes on the music and songs are admirably evocative, and its economical account of the huge range of critical views will send thousands of readers out in fruitful chases after the play's own multitudinous interests.'

When medical student Mark Curry is approached by a man with strange golden eyes and told that he is an Eternal events are set in motion that force Mark to question everything he has ever believed. Written by Hugo and Eisner Award winner Neil Gaiman and illustrated by the celebrated and popular John Romita Jr. Scheduled for movie release in 2020 The Eternals is the next big Marvel movie blockbuster! Collecting Eternals Volume 1 #1-7, plus Eternals Sketchbook and Marvel Spotlight: Neil Gaiman.</p><p>Jack Kirby's old Eternals series gets a serious dusting-off from Gaiman (<i>Anansi Boys</i>) and artist Romita. The Eternals, a super-race, are now scattered and forgetful of their powers and immortality, living mortal human lives of supreme normalcy (Sersi is a New York party girl, while Makkari believes himself to be Bellevue ER doc Mark Curry). Meanwhile their age-old enemies, the Deviants, stalk the earth with nefarious intentions, and at least one of the super-duper-race Celestials (who created both Deviants and Eternals eons ago) may be returning to Earth. The source of all this forgetfulness and strife appears to be the eternally 11-year-old Sprite, who desires to be allowed to age like an actual human. It is easy to spot Gaiman's touch in this modern-day clash between ancient forces, as he shies away from Kirby's '70s-era, <i>Chariots of God</i>&#x2013;style alien mythologizing to focus more on the characters' slow coming to grips with the enormity of their identity and the loss of humanity that comes from being an Eternal. Romita's storytelling is strong without coming near Kirby's epochal original. While Gaiman fans will still sign up, it isn't long before the tale gets tangled in the Olympian scope of this often baffling struggle. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Based on this idea that children respond better to positive rather than negative reinforcement, the Children Are from Heaven program concentrates on rewarding, not punishing, children and fostering their innate desire to please their parents.</p><p>Central to this approach are the five positive messages your children need to learn again and again:</p><p>It's okay to be different.<br>It's okay to make mistakes.<br>It's okay to express negative emotions.<br>It's okay to want more.<br>It's okay to say no, but remember Mom and Dad are the bosses.</p></p><p>Psychologist John Gray (he of <i>Men Are from Mars...</i> fame) cites a need to shift from "fear-based parenting" (a punitive and oppressive approach to child rearing) to "love-based parenting" (which accepts children's desires and negative emotions while still setting reasonable limits). With child and teen violence increasing, rampant low self-esteem, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and attention deficit disorder, he says, "the Western free world is experiencing a crisis in parenting. Almost all parents today are questioning both the old and the new ways of parenting. Nothing seems to be working." <p> He suggests "Five Messages of Positive Parenting" that will facilitate such a shift: </p><ol> <li>It's okay to be different. </li><li>It's okay to make mistakes. </li><li>It's okay to express negative emotions. </li><li>It's okay to want more. </li><li>It's okay to say no, but remember mom and dad are the bosses. </li></ol><p> Although his parenting philosophy is not necessarily revolutionary (think "positive discipline"), Gray manages to keep this parenting primer contemporary by weaving in specific challenges of new-millennium families--such as our tendency to be consumer-driven and overscheduled. "When parents learn what their children really need, they are less motivated to create money to acquire things and more motivated to create time to enjoy their family," Gray writes. "The greatest wealth for a parent today is time." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>John Gray, Ph.D., is one of the world&#x2019;s leading relationship experts, and an authority on improving communication styles for couples, companies, and communities.

From the entrepreneurial visionaries to the scientists&#x2019; workshops to the big business board�rooms&#x2014;Shapiro details that quest for clean meat and other animal products and examines the debate raging around it.<br><br>Since the dawn of <i>Homo sapiens</i> some quarter million years ago, animals have satiated our species&#x2019; desire for meat. But with a growing global popula�tion and demand for meat, eggs, dairy, leather, and more, raising such massive numbers of farm animals is woefully inefficient and takes an enormous toll on the planet, public health, and certainly the animals themselves.<br> <br> But what if we could have our meat and eat it, too? The next great scientific revolution is underway&#x2014;discovering new ways to create enough food for the world&#x2019;s ever-growing, ever-hungry population.<br> <br> Enter clean meat&#x2014;real, actual meat grown (or brewed!) from animal cells&#x2014;as well as other clean foods that ditch animal cells altogether and are simply built from the molecule up. Also called lab-grown meat, cultured meat, or cell-based meat, this race promises promise to bring about another domestication. Whereas our ancestors domesticated wild animals into livestock, today we&#x2019;re beginning to domesticate their cells, leaving the animals out of the equation. From one single cell of a cow, you could feed an entire village. And the story of this coming &#x201c;second domestica�tion&#x201d; is anything but tame.</p><p>When Paul Shapiro took his first bite of clean meat in 2014, more humans had gone into space than had eaten real meat grown outside an animal. In addition to being among the world&#x2019;s first clean meat consumers, Paul is a&nbsp;four-time&nbsp;TEDx speaker, the co-host of the&nbsp;<i>Business for Good Podcast</i>, the CEO of&nbsp;The Better Meat Co., and longtime leader in food sustainability. He&#x2019;s&nbsp;published hundreds of articles&nbsp;in publications ranging from daily newspapers to academic journals. Paul lives in Sacramento, California with his&nbsp;wife&nbsp;Toni Okamoto,&nbsp;author and founder of&nbsp;<i>Plant-Based on a Budget</i>.&nbsp;His first book, <i>Clean Meat</i>, is a&nbsp;<i>Washington Post</i>&nbsp;bestseller, and has been translated into numerous other languages.

A masterful achievement--as profound as it is mesmerizing. (Ficiton--Horror)</p><p>Dean Koontz was born in Everett, Pennsylvania, and grew up in nearby Bedford. He won an Atlantic Monthly fiction competition when he was twenty and has been writing ever since. Mr. Koontz&#39;s books are published in 38 languages.

Dean and his wife, Gerda, live in southern California.The King of Creep is back, not with a novel, however, but with his first collection of short fiction. Fourteen stories, two of which are actually novel length, provide Koontz with various venues for exploring eeriness. The title piece, one of the two very long works in the collection, is the tale of a young man's hallucinations; the other long story, entitled "Chase," is a dark, almost dank psychological suspense yarn. An out-and-out monster appears in the shorter "Black Pumpkin," and "Bruno" is a combination sf and detective story. Other stories take different approaches to tingling the reader's spine, but all are successful.

Her impressive, highly readable <i>Survivor Caf�</i> takes on important issues of atrocity, trauma, and memory, rendering them all with such great clarity and intimacy that the reader will not soon forget them, or this powerful book." &#x2015;Viet Thanh Nguyen, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>The Sympathizer</i> <br><br> "This is a personal exploration for Rosner, but also an exploration of the commonalities found in the children of survivors." &#x2015;<i>Read it Forward</i> <br><br> "<i>Survivor Caf�</i> is an exercise in mapmaking, in identifying convergent paths in apparently disparate legacies left by the world&#x2019;s humanitarian disasters . . . [Rosner] asks us to look inside ourselves, to learn from the past, to forgive, and to understand the deep connections binding us to our past, our future, and to all other things." &#x2015;<i>Lilith Magazine</i> <br><br> "<i>Survivor Caf�</i> is a beautifully expressed personal examination of how trauma is passed down through generations...An exquisite read." &#x2015;<i>The Daily Gazette</i> <br><br> "In deep fissures and dark alleys having to do with multigenerational trauma, anti-Semitism, racism, terrorism, torture, death and loss, Berkeley writer Elizabeth Rosner uncovers, improbably, hope and connection." &#x2015;<i>The Mercury News</i> <br><br> "There&#x2019;s been a slew of research examining the genetic effects of psychological trauma, but author Elizabeth Rosner is among the first to take a deep dive into the personal implications of such inheritance with her stunning new book, <i>Survivor Caf�: The Legacy of Trauma and the Labyrinth of Memory</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Orange County Register</i> <br><br> "Deeply moving." &#x2015;Berkeleyside <br><br> "Rosner&#x2019;s writing is crafted like the poet she is, and her ability to meld and transcend her own story with those of survivors of wars, slavery, and genocide is nothing less than brilliant and more importantly, healing." &#x2015;ACEs Connection <br><br> "Rosner demonstrates a rare blend of scholarly assessment and personal revelation, tempering her singular passion with an encompassing mercy. In this important and vital contribution to the conversation about legacy and responsibility, Rosner distills the magnitude of such burdens and defines the scope of memorialization with an elegance and eloquence that reverberates with both depth and nuance." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review) <br><br> "A thoughtful, probing meditation on the fragility of memory and the indelible inheritance of pain." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br><br> "Novelist Rosner (<i>Electric City</i>) shines an unblinking light on the most horrific of 20th-century crimes and asks: What is the intergenerational legacy of trauma? . . . She considers art, anniversaries, memorials, and psychotherapy, but the most powerful technique she finds for dealing with trauma is simply telling the story behind it . . . Themes of memory, language, and the bodily imprint of trauma are powerful, as are Rosner&#x2019;s accounts of revisiting Buchenwald with her father . . . Rosner's conclusions&#x2015;that powerful suffering must be communicated before healing can occur and that the most profound of human atrocities must be acknowledged so that their like does not happen again&#x2015;open the door to understanding and, optimistically, show a path to peace." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br> "This is the book that clinicians and patients alike have been waiting for. Rosner seamlessly integrates the latest research on intergenerational trauma with her own deeply moving personal account. The result is a true advancement in the field, a must-read that is rich, accessible, compelling, and informative." &#x2013;&#x2013;Joshua Simmons, Psy.D., Clinical Psychologist and Candidate in Analytic Training at the C.G. Jung Institute of San Francisco <br><br> &#x201c;Using her experiences as a child of Holocaust survivors, [Rosner] navigates the audience through the realms of epigenetics, psychotherapy, history, and philosophical struggles to bring something unique to the study of trauma . . . These personal recollections provide a dimension that softens some of the most indigestible theories and concepts that we have come to associate with memory, psychology, psychoanalysis, trauma, and history . . . paving the way for future studies." &#x2013;&#x2013;Ellis Spicer, <i>Reviews in History</i>, Institute of Historical Research<br><br> "Elizabeth Rosner's <i>Survivor Caf�</i> is about how we inherit, not just our histories, but the complexities of how we survive them. With the heart of a poet, Rosner unpeels the layers of trauma in a way that will stay with you long after you read the last page.&#x201d; &#x2015;Emily Rapp Black, author of <i>The Still Point of the Turning World</i> <br><br> "In <i>Survivor Caf�</i>, Elizabeth Rosner brilliantly captures both the enormity of war and its enduring aftershocks&#x2015;the devastating legacies for victims, perpetrators, and societies who suffer through and beyond it. A mixture of history, personal narrative, and research, the book expertly documents how atrocities are passed down through generations and how we may find ways to contain this pernicious inheritance. <i>Survivor Caf�</i> is a vital, living document that proves the end of war is far from the end of the battle." &#x2015;Andrew Carroll, editor of the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>War Letters</i> and <i>Behind the Lines</i> <br><br> "Elizabeth Rosner explores how trauma infiltrates minds and bodies and language. In lyrical, luminous prose, she takes on the obligation to remember lives lost. Genocide, war, nuclear bombs, lynching&#x2015;Rosner does not turn away from unceasing violence and its aftermath. Urgent and necessary, this book offers brave witness to the world we have made and must repair." &#x2015;Sarah Sentilles, author of <i>Draw Your Weapons</i> <br><br> &#x201c;A staggering work of intellectual vigor and raw emotion, <i>Survivor Caf�</i> mines the darkest recesses of our collective past, excavating both the hate and hope of human history. Rosner's intimate handling of intergenerational trauma, as well as the need to acknowledge and transcend it, reminds us of the power and mercy of stories. In our current age of hyper-immediacy, with increasingly short news cycles and even shorter memories, Rosner's work reminds us of our sacred duty to carry these stories forward like a lantern in the dark.&#x201d; &#x2015;Aline Ohanesian, author of <i>Orhan's Inheritance</i> <br><br> "Using the Holocaust as a focal point, <em>Survivor Caf�</em> renders a profound and unflinching portrait of trauma and the memory of trauma, the consequences of inhumanity, atrocities that do not end with one generation but are inherited as nightmare, memory, and affliction, passed on to the next generation and the next and the next. With vivid stories and brilliant insights, this book must be required reading for those who want to understand not just our collective history but the present moment." &#x2015;Susan Griffin, award-winning author of <em>A Chorus of Stones</em> <br><br> "In this haunting and poetic book, Elizabeth Rosner summons her readers to a deep and abiding commemoration of genocide. The daughter of Holocaust survivors, Rosner describes scientific evidence that deep trauma persists not only emotionally but also physically through generations. This is an inspired, illuminated book&#x2015;the fruit of hard experience and deep study. I salute Elizabeth Rosner&#x2019;s <i>Survivor Caf�</i>, a work of wisdom and, ultimately, hope." &#x2015;Elizabeth Farnsworth, author of <i>A Train Through Time</i> <br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Electric City</i></b> <br><br> "Rosner beautifully bridges past and present in the dynamism of her historical depictions, capturing the dangers and excitement of invention, the complex play between generations of America's immigrant populations and its native peoples, the wonder of young love, and the insatiable spark of curiosity that is a calling card of scientific inquiry, and a hallmark of the human heart." &#x2015;<i>Elle Magazine</i> <br><br> "Rosner's lyrical new novel chronicles the rise and fall of this company town, following several generations of immigrants and the Native American people who watched them come...Through layers of time 'sticky like amber,' Rosner etches images of family, community, and the electric power of love." &#x2015;Jane Ciabattari, <i>BBC</i> <br><br> "...remarkable, lyrical... It's a wondrous thing to watch the deepening and unfurling of a writer's talent over one book and another and another. <i>Electric City</i> is Elizabeth Rosner at her best yet, a book that leaves the reader hungering for her next." &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i> <br><br> "Rich and poignant...The provenance of each character is thematically and dramatically significant...and the novel beautifully explores the ways we attach ourselves to a place, the ways we might escape it, and how these things, like the Hudson River, often flow both ways." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br><br> "Rosner skillfully captures the city's conflicts between science and nature, history and progress. From immigrant experience to coming-of-age story, <i>Electric City</i> is a luminous tale." &#x2015;<i>San Jose Mercury News</i> <br><br> "...there is also a great affection in this novel, for a place at once as old as lightning and as young as the latest invention. All the characters in this book&#x2015;and, I suppose, this reviewer&#x2015;are just molecules passing through the Electric City." &#x2015;<i>Historical Novel Society</i> <br><br> "Rosner's richly imagined historical novel conveys an abiding sense of time and place. A deeply evocative paean to the wonders of science, the perils of technology, and the sacrifices of people in thrall to their power." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "With deft descriptions, Rosner sketches the bustling city, on land long cherished by aboriginal culture, which grew and flourished as whites invaded and industrialized...offers a gentle meditation on love and loss." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i> <br><br> "This beautiful book joins the compression, vivid intensity, and imaginative connectivity of poetry to the deep character work of the novel. Rosner handles with effortless assurance both the small, intimate stories and the great impersonal worlds of science, nature, and history that combine to make us who we are." &#x2015;Karen Joy Fowler, <i>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</i>, Winner of the 2014 PEN/Faulkner Award <br><br> "A heady mix of world-changing history (Thomas Edison and Charles Steinmetz) coupled against a bewitching love triangle ignites Rosner's gorgeously written exploration of the way inventions transform cities, hearts, and lives, sometimes with a terrible cost, and the way light nudges inroads in the darkness. Electrifyingly original." &#x2015;Caroline Leavitt, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Is This Tomorrow</i> and <i>Pictures of You</i> <br><br> "Reminiscent of <i>In the Skin of a Lion</i> and set in a 1960s New York manufacturing town once founded by Thomas Edison, <i>Electric City</i> is a love story made incandescent by Rosner's prose. The triangle she creates between Sophie Levine and her two admirers is as tangled, tragic, and beautiful as the history of their fundamentally American city." &#x2015;Maria Hummel, author of <i>Motherland</i> <br><br> "At the heart of this gripping novel is the brilliant mathematician Charles Proteus Steinmetz, whose ability to capture lightning in a bottle electrifies a city and animates the lives of friends and strangers. Rosner achieves something just as powerful and thrilling in this marvelous book." &#x2015;Ann Packer, author of <i>The Dive from Clausen&#x2019;s Pier</i> <br><br> "<i>Electric City</i> is the gripping narrative of an ever-changing America seen through the prism of one town caught between the past and the future, and the tangled tragic love triangle set within it. Compelling, beautiful, important, and timeless, <i>Electric City</i> is as much a thoughtful look at our changing past as it is a metaphor for the present. Elizabeth Rosner is a bright literary light." &#x2015;Jennifer Gilmore, author of <i>The Mothers </i> <br><br> "At once a subtly nuanced love story, a celebration of American invention, and a critique of the juggernaut of 'progress' in the twentieth century, <i>Electric City</i> is a compelling, deeply moving novel about the heyday and decline of Schenectady (the titular "Electric City") as an industrial power. The novel moves between the twenties and sixties, deftly interweaving the historical and fictional in a way that illuminates the tension between western ideas of progress and Native American rhythms and sensibilities. But the real incandescence in this story comes from Rosner's luminous, eloquent prose. Simply a beautiful novel." &#x2015;Marjorie Darraugh, Pegasus Books <br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Blue Nude</i></b> <br><br> "An elegiac story of an emotionally and creatively starved artist and his muse..The present diverges to the past, and Rosner develops her protagonists as though they are pieces of art, slowly becoming unveiled. Although their backgrounds are divergent, their interior lives are similar. Rosner&#x2019;s multilayered composition is rendered in beautiful, spare prose and will resonate long after the last page." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br> "We watch, spellbound, as the story seems to levitate midair, as the characters seamlessly unfold a plot that is no less than fascinating. Using the rhythms of poetry, Elizabeth Rosner has created a lyrical tour de force." &#x2015;Linda Gray Sexton, <i>Half in Love: Surviving the Legacy of Suicide</i> <br><br> "Rosner has a painter's eye and a poet's ear. Blue Nude is a luminous book about painful histories&#x2015;both private and global&#x2015;and how they stay with us even as they travel through to become something else&#x2015;quite possibly art. A book both heady and tangible, both unflinching and generous, but always beautiful to read." &#x2015;Karen Joy Fowler, <i>The Jane Austen Book Club</i> <br><br> "Through German artist, Danzig, and Israeli muse, Merav, Elizabeth Rosner builds a bridge from loss to reconciliation, from anger to understanding. <i>Blue Nude</i> is a lyrical exploration of how we -- as individuals and as a society&#x2015;move past our separate histories and toward a shared redemption. This is truly a lovely book." &#x2015;Meg Waite Clayton, <i>The Wednesday Sisters</i> <br><br> "Blue Nude is a novel which spans time and continents, from post war Germany to California to Israeli kibbutzim, a novel which explores the big questions of history, fate, art, how we choose to live the lives we&#x2019;re given&#x2013;and yet it&#x2019;s also wonderfully intimate as well in its exploration of the hearts of its individual characters. Elizabeth Rosner has written a thought provoking, moving and original book." &#x2015;Dan Chaon, <i>Await Your Reply</i> and <i>Stay Awake</i> <br><br> "Rosner takes on complexity with a brilliant poet&#x2019;s insistence tha...</p><h2>Stolen Beauty: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A powerful and important tale of love and war, art and family...I was transported.&#x201d; &#x2014;Allison Pataki, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;Albanese artfully weaves Adele&#x2019;s story with Maria&#x2019;s harrowing life under the Nazis, but it&#x2019;s hard to read <i>Stolen Beauty</i> without seeing ugly echoes in today&#x2019;s headlines.

Inside, we were waltzing and drinking French champagne. My dear friend Lily had just become engaged to a Catholic man, and the glittering ballroom was in full swing. Music was playing&#x2014;it was Schubert&#x2014;and men in bow ties were circulating with trays of crab cakes and miniature mushroom tortes. Someone toasted the happy couple. There was crystal, and dresses the colors of hyacinths and tulips. The dance floor was a blur of pastels.<br> <br>It was a long time ago, but I can still see everything clearly.<br> <br>I was wearing violet perfume, and dusk was approaching. Fritz moved like a panther in his tuxedo as he crossed the room toward me. My mother was wearing a shimmering gray dress, and my father was holding his bow over the cello strings when someone shouted, &#x201c;The chancellor is making a speech.&#x201d;<br> <br>Aunt Adele was long in her grave, but I saw my uncle Ferdinand put out a hand to steady himself near the cocktail bar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Schuschnigg is on the radio,&#x201d; the man shouted again in an angry voice. &#x201c;Silence, everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>The violinists ripped their bows from the strings, and our host turned up the volume on the radio. The chancellor&#x2019;s voice rang across the room just as Fritz reached my side. Every bit of my husband&#x2019;s childhood in the Jewish ghetto had been polished away by then, replaced by elegant manners, a starched white shirt, and a clear, operatic baritone. He put his arm around my shoulder and his ruby cuff link brushed my cheek, a cool spot in the warm room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Men and women of Austria: this day has placed before us a serious and decisive situation,&#x201d; Chancellor von Schuschnigg said.<br> <br>He took a choked breath that we could hear through the radio waves. Men I&#x2019;d known since I was a girl turned pale. They lowered their champagne flutes and balled up their cocktail napkins. Lily wilted against her father&#x2019;s thin frame. Someone tipped over a glass, and it shattered.<br> <br>The chancellor said that Hitler&#x2019;s army was at our borders, and for one more second I believed our small country was about to go to war. I thought we would fight the Germans, and that we could win.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have decided to order the troops to offer no resistance,&#x201d; the chancellor said. &#x201c;So I take leave of the Austrian people with a German word of farewell uttered from the depth of my heart&#x2014;God protect Austria.&#x201d;<br> <br>A strange sound came from my husband&#x2019;s throat. I saw my mother mouth my father&#x2019;s name&#x2014;Gustav&#x2014;and my father mouth hers&#x2014;Thedy&#x2014;in a single moment that seared itself into my mind like a photograph. A woman fainted, and sirens began to wail in the streets outside. I saw Uncle Ferdinand waving in my direction, but my parents circled around us saying Secure your money. Secure your jewels. Go home. Lock your doors. Get your passports. Get out and then Fritz and I were pouring outside into the fading evening with everyone else.<br> <br>Church bells were ringing, and hundreds of people were crowding into the streets waving Nazi flags. I had no idea there were so many Austrians just waiting for the F�hrer. But there they were, hordes of ordinary Gentiles who thought Hitler was right and the Jews were to blame for their problems&#x2014;poverty, sadness, cold, whatever it was they were angry about, Hitler wanted them to blame us. And they did. They were smiling and laughing and waving their swastikas. They were shouting, Germany is united&#x2014;long live Hitler.<br> <br>We all knew what had been happening to the Jews in Germany, but until that moment it had seemed a world away. If that makes us willfully ignorant or foolish and naive, then that&#x2019;s what we were. There&#x2019;s no other way to say it.<br> <br>Behind the wheel of our new black sedan, Fritz stared straight ahead. Men in brown uniforms marched arm in arm through the street as if they&#x2019;d stepped right from the thick walls of the Ringstrasse buildings. Soldiers stood like hard marionettes with their chins thrust into the air. I wanted to ask Fritz where they&#x2019;d been hiding with their pressed uniforms and shining swastika pins, but when I saw tears on my husband&#x2019;s face I bit the inside of my cheek and swallowed my words.<br> <br>By the time we reached the Altmann Textiles factory grounds, where we lived in our newlywed apartment, Fritz had composed himself and looked as much like the vice president of the business as he could manage.<br> <br>&#x201c;Four men were here asking for you,&#x201d; the gateman said. Otto was a strong man with a clean, square jawline and two lovely children. He secured the padlock behind us, and for the first time in my life it occurred to me that I was locked inside the gates. &#x201c;They wanted to see the man who runs the factory.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you tell them?&#x201d; Fritz asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said Bernhard Altmann is away on business, and Fritz Altmann is here in Austria.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did they say?&#x201d;<br> <br>Otto blanched.<br> <br>&#x201c;They said, &#x2018;There is no Austria anymore.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Inside the apartment we bolted the door, turned off the lights, and crawled under the blankets. We&#x2019;d been married only four months; I was twenty-two and Fritz was thirty, but we held each other like frightened children.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll leave right away,&#x201d; Fritz whispered. &#x201c;Tomorrow, if it&#x2019;s possible. You go with Uncle Ferdinand, and I&#x2019;ll join you as soon as I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>My uncle Ferdinand and Fritz&#x2019;s brother Bernhard had both tried to warn us about Hitler, but their fears had seemed hazy and improbable and we&#x2019;d listened the way most of Austria had listened: with one hand on the radio dial, searching for music and entertainment.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving without you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll wait until your passport is renewed.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had a valid passport, but Fritz&#x2019;s had expired after our honeymoon. We&#x2019;d filled out the paperwork, filed for a renewal, and forgotten about it. That had been a month ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to get a passport now,&#x201d; Fritz said. Lights from the factory grounds shone through our bedroom window, illuminating his face in zigzagged shadows. &#x201c;The Nazis aren&#x2019;t going to give me one. You go first, and I&#x2019;ll come as soon as I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go where?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go anywhere without you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go with your uncle to Jungfer Brezan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where he said he would go if Hitler came. Czechoslovakia will be safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>Only then did I remember my uncle waving to me on the dance floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call Uncle Ferdinand in the morning,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll make sure we can get out together.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pressed my cheek against Fritz&#x2019;s, and recalled the faint cinnamon of his aftershave on the night we&#x2019;d met. There had been music and men in tuxedos that night, too&#x2014;a cool breeze coming through an open window at the Lawyers&#x2019; Ball, and a line of women holding their dance cards and waiting for the second waltz.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just look at him,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d breathed to Lily when Fritz walked by. He&#x2019;d moved as I thought a lover might move when he wanted a woman, as if there was velvet under his feet. And there was the cinnamon scent, like warm bread and breakfast in bed, lingering in his wake.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Fritz Altmann,&#x201d; Lily had whispered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an amateur opera singer and a real charmer. I admit he&#x2019;s a looker, but don&#x2019;t waste your time on him&#x2014;he&#x2019;s crazy about a married woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>I might have heeded my friend&#x2019;s warning if Fritz hadn&#x2019;t climbed onto the music stage just then and silenced the room with Schubert&#x2019;s aching love song: You are peace, the gentle peace&#x2014;you are longing, and what stills it. Maybe he was a playboy, but his voice had the warmth of a roaring fire. He sang about longing, pleasure, and pain. He sang as if he wanted a home, and that very night I&#x2019;d made one for him inside myself.<br> <br>I wouldn&#x2019;t leave Austria or Vienna without him. To even think of it was terrifying.<br> <br><br> <br>I was swallowing a bite of dry toast the next morning when a delivery boy in a blue hat hammered at the kitchen door. The sky was flat as Fritz gave the boy a silver coin and read the cable from his brother.<br> <br>Safe in Paris. Secure the books. Come immediately or await my instructions. Stop. Bernhard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Fritz said in a tight voice. &#x201c;I have to secure the ledgers.&#x201d;<br> <br>The newspaper was unopened on our table, with a photograph of Hitler&#x2019;s motorcade crossing the Danube River above a boxed notice that read: EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY Jews must report all property, holdings, and cash to the Central Offices of the Reich. Those failing to cooperate will be subject to seizure and imprisonment.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling Uncle Ferdinand,&#x201d; I said. I hit the telephone receiver once, then twice. The line was dead, and that gave me a new sense of urgency. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going over there. He might already have a passport and papers for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go out there,&#x201d; Fritz said. &#x201c;We have no idea what&#x2019;s happening in the streets.&#x201d;<br> <br>I buttoned up my coat and pulled on my scarf and gloves. My resolve was a metronome clacking inside me: I can&#x2019;t leave without you, I won&#x2019;t leave without you, I can&#x2019;t leave without you, I won&#x2019;t leave without you.<br> <br>&#x201c;You get the ledgers. I&#x2019;ll see my uncle, and then I&#x2019;m going to check on my parents,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be home in three hours, maybe less.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>The Altmann Textiles factory was set on four acres in Vienna&#x2019;s Margareten District, southwest of the city center. The buildings were yellow and whitewashed brick connected by a maze of smooth pathways. There was a modern cafeteria where everyone ate lunch together, and Fritz and Bernhard knew each of their three hundred employees by name.<br> <br>Fritz walked me to the front gate, when we found Otto still on duty at the guardhouse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the morning man?&#x201d; Fritz asked.<br> <br>The workers usually began arriving before eight in the morning, but that day the grounds were still empty.<br> <br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t show up,&#x201d; Otto said with a shrug. He looked at my sturdy shoes. &#x201c;Frau Altmann, the streets are dangerous. I hope you&#x2019;re not going out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Fritz said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with you later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going now.&#x201d; I pressed my face against his. &#x201c;You take care of the books.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outside the gates, our street was deserted and the houses silent. Shades pulled low across dark drawing room windows seemed to flutter and blink as I walked away from home. I was much more frightened than I&#x2019;d let on to Fritz. At the tram stop I kept my eyes on the ground and pulled my collar up around my face. I tried not to think of anything. I tried only to breathe and stay calm.<br> <br>There was no ticket taker on the tram. The seats were full of silent workmen and servants in white starched uniforms. I shoved my ticket into my pocket and held on to a leather strap as the rail rolled beneath me. As we rounded the Mariahilf District, there was an angry red Nazi banner hanging from a tall building. We all turned to look, and the car buzzed with something that seemed to hang between anticipation and terror.<br> <br>At the stop near the Naschmarkt, a big man in a black uniform stepped onto the streetcar and shouted, Heil Hitler. The entire car saluted back, but I hesitated. The man barked again, Heil Hitler, and stared until I put up my arm and mouthed the words. As I did, I saw the Secession gallery slide by on my left. Soldiers stood in a line across the museum steps, unfurling a red banner that covered the slogan that had been there all my life. I struggled to recall the words, but they slid away as quickly as the golden dome slid from view.<br> <br>The next stop was Karlsplatz, where the Church of St. Charles anchored the square. I got off without looking back. The church doors were flung open, the bells were ringing, and there was a crowd of people in front of the fountain. I turned the other way, clutched my handbag to my side, and tried not to run through the streets.<br> <br>My uncle&#x2019;s house was on Elisabethstrasse, overlooking Schiller Park. As I rounded a stand of naked shrubs, I nearly tripped over a line of old women on their knees. The women were dressed in fur coats and patent leather boots, and they were scrubbing the sidewalks with toothbrushes. I lost my footing and came to a full stop, nearly retching in the street.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you do a good job, filthy Jew, maybe I&#x2019;ll let you keep that fat diamond ring,&#x201d; a soldier barked. He butted a woman with his rifle, and I felt a sharp pain in my jaw, as if he&#x2019;d struck me, too. The woman cried out, and he struck her again. I scanned the old faces, praying I wouldn&#x2019;t see anyone I knew.<br> <br>&#x201c;Join us, fr�ulein,&#x201d; a soldier leered at me. Another one laughed, and I thought I might faint. &#x201c;We can use a pretty young one like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I fled from the park, hurried up the steps at 18 Elisabethstrasse and banged on the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uncle Ferdinand?&#x201d; I called first for my uncle, then for his butler. &#x201c;Georg? Are you in there? It&#x2019;s Maria&#x2014;it&#x2019;s me, please open the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>A gunshot rang out in the park behind me, and my knees went weak.<br> <br>The door opened and my uncle&#x2019;s cook was standing in her white uniform, a dish towel over her shoulder. I was prepared to throw myself into her arms, but she looked at me with a cool eye.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your uncle isn&#x2019;t here,&#x201d; Brigitte said. &#x201c;He left before dawn. He&#x2019;s probably across the border by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Left?&#x201d; I asked numbly. It had not occurred to me that my uncle might leave without us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Without a word to anyone.&#x201d; Brigitte&#x2019;s mouth twisted. &#x201c;Georg saw him pack his papers and lock up the safe. He&#x2019;s probably gone to Jungfer Brezan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did he leave anything for me?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;A package or an envelope?&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to check his study.&#x201d; Even to my ears, it was clear the words were a plea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Suit yourself,&#x201d; she said, and stepped aside.<br> <br>The grand palais was silent. The furniture seemed to cast long shadows across the parlor, and the grandfather clock on the landing kept time like ticking dynamite. Upstairs, my uncle&#x2019;s desk was impossibly tidy. I tried the desk drawers, but they were locked. I looked under the radio and the ink blotter and ran my hand along the clean bookshelves. There wasn&#x2019;t even a layer of dust.<br> <br>I could smell my uncle&#x2019;s cigars, but very quickly it was clear that he&#x2019;d left nothing for me. My last chance was Aunt Adele&#x2019;s sitting room, where her golden portrait hung. The room was a shrine to my aunt, filled with her favorite paintings and books. The curtains were drawn, and the air inside was stale. Her portrait was filled with gold and silver baubles and strange symbols I&#x2019;d never been able to puzzle out. I&#x2019;d often had coffee and cake in that room with my uncle, nibbling on sweets while he talked about the wife who&#x2019;d died when I was only nine.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was celebrated throughout Europe and the empire. One day that legacy will belong to you, Maria,&#x201d; my uncle had said. He&#x2019;d leaned over and brushed my cheek. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the daughter we never had. The daughter she longed for.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outside the palais a woman screamed, and gunshots followed. I pushed aside thick curtains and saw two women lying in pools of blood. My knees buckled, and for a moment my eyes went black. An engine roared, a horn blared, and there was the sound of dogs&#x2019; frenzied barking.<br> <br>I pulled away from the window and grabbed for Adele&#x2019;s letter opener in a panic. I felt sure there was something hidden in the room for me&#x2014;perhaps behind the portrait or slipped into a picture frame.<br> <br>Another shot rang out, and a jeep screeched to a stop outside. I heard heavy boots on the landing, and loud kn...</p><h2>Western Ranch Houses by Cliff May</h2><p>The success of the first edition of Sunset Western Ranch Houses led Sunset and Cliff May to bring out a second edition in 1958. Very different than the first edition, this too proved to be a best-seller. In addition being more thorough than the earlier work, the second edition also showed that May&#39;s architecture was going in new directions. He still preserved the rustic traditions and materials of the ranch house, but his designs were more open and flexible.

Written with insight, enthusiasm, and impeccable scholarship, <b>Inner Revolution </b>is not only a national bestseller and&nbsp;practical primer on one of the world's most fascinating traditions, but&nbsp;it is also&nbsp;a wide-ranging look at the course of our civilization--and how we can alter it for the better. "Part spiritual memoir, part philosophical treatise and part religious history, Thurman's book is a passionate declaration of the possibilities of renewing the world" (Publishers Weekly, starred review).</p><p>Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman (yes, he is the father of Uma) was named one of <i>Time</i> magazine's 25 most influential people in 1997. Here's why: Thurman has a knack for helping laymen understand the teachings and history of Buddhism while also explaining why it has taken root in the West. Thurman was the first Westerner to be ordained as a monk in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition after studying under the Dalai Lama in 1964. In this highly polished memoir he tells the story of his pupilage under His Holiness, which was a frolic in Sunday school compared to the task of integrating Buddhism into cold war America.

Over a five-year period during the 1990s Mattias Gardell observed and participated in pagan ceremonies and interviewed pagan activists across the United States. His unprecedented entree into this previously obscure realm is the basis for this firsthand account of the proliferating web of organizations and belief systems combining pre-Christian pagan mythologies with Aryan separatism. Gardell outlines the historical development of the different strands of racist paganism&#x2014;including Wotanism, Odinism and Darkside Asatr�&#x2014;and situates them on the spectrum of pagan belief ranging from Wicca and goddess worship to Satanism. <p></p><p><i>Gods of the Blood </i>details the trends that have converged to fuel militant paganism in the United States: anti-government sentiments inflamed by such events as Ruby Ridge and Waco, the rise of the white power music industry (including whitenoise, dark ambient, and hatecore), the extraordinary reach of modern communications technologies, and feelings of economic and cultural marginalization in the face of globalization and increasing racial and ethnic diversity of the American population. Gardell elucidates how racist pagan beliefs are formed out of various combinations of conspiracy theories, anti-Semitism, warrior ideology, populism, beliefs in racial separatism, Klandom, skinhead culture, and tenets of national socialism. He shows how these convictions are further animated by an array of thought selectively derived from thinkers including Nietzche, historian Oswald Spengler, Carl Jung, and racist mystics. Scrupulously attentive to the complexities of racist paganism as it is lived and practiced, <i>Gods of the Blood</i> is a fascinating, disturbing, and important portrait of the virulent undercurrents of certain kinds of violence in America today.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Gods of the Blood&#34; represents the culmination of the author&#39;s tireless fieldwork among America&#39;s radical right: race activists of every description, denizens of the occult underground, and adherents of a variety of small oppositional religio-political belief systems throughout the United States. Never before has a scholar had the means, the determination, or the unparalleled access Mattias Gardell has been accorded in the American radical right.&#34;--Jeffrey Kaplan, author of the &#34;Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right&#34;<p>Mattias Gardell is Associate Professor in the History of Religions at Stockholm University.

Meanwhile, burning for vengeance after the brutal murder of his wife, Helikaon commands the Trojan fleet, sowing misery and death among the Mykene navy and supply ships. But even these mighty efforts are of scant avail against the hordes of battle-hardened Mykene infantry, the Myrmidon soldiers of Achilles, and the cunning strategies of Odysseus, compelled against his heart&#x2019;s urgings to aid the cause of Agamemnon.<br><br>Now, before the gates of Troy, Hektor and Achilles will find themselves inexorably drawn into a battle of champions that will decide the fate of the innocents trapped within the city walls. There, as King Priam slips into madness, Andromache&#x2013;wife of Hektor, lover of Helikaon, mother, warrior, and priestess&#x2013;must navigate a maze of treachery and danger to save her children and her city from the massacre about to unfold.</p><p>THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER Darkness falls on the Great Green, and the Ancient World is fiercely divided. On the killing fields outside the golden city of Troy, forces loyal to the Mykene King mass. Among them is Odysseus, fabled storyteller and reluctant ally to the Mykene, who knows that he must soon face his former friends in deadly combat. Within the city, the Trojan king waits. Ailing and bitter, his hope is pinned on two heroes: his favourite son Hektor, and the dread Helikaon who will wreak terrible vengeance for the death of his wife at Mykene hands. War has been declared &#x2013; a war filled with bloodlust, and peopled by heroes who will live for ever in a story that will echo down the centuries.

We are a motley clan indeed, we fellow primates, including in our ranks the huge, red-haired orangutan of Sumatra and Borneo, the Japanese Macaque, which roams snow-covered mountains in Japan, the Hamadryas Baboon of the Ethiopian deserts, the Red Uakari of the Amazon jungle, the Ring-tailed Lemur of Madagascar -- and so many more. Humans are most closely related to the great apes, especially the Chimpanzee and Bonobo. We are, in fact, the seventh great ape, although we seldom think of ourselves in this way.</p> <p><b>CHANGING ATTITUDES</b><br> When, in 1960, I began observing the Chimpanzees of the Gombe Stream Game Reserve (today a national pork) on the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika, there had been very few detailed studies of primates in the Wild. My descriptions of their complex social behavior, of tool-making and tool-use that required intelligence and of emotions that seemed similar to our own were largely dismissed as anthropomorphic by western science. Even the use of names rather than numbers to identify the Chimpanzees being studied was frowned upon by many European ethologists of the time. Gradually, though, this rigid attitude began to change, as field studies of animals with complex brains increasingly provided evidence of similarly complex behavior. Now, nearly half a century later, we acknowledge that many behaviors -- intellectual, social and emotional -- that were once believed to be unique to ourselves are shown by other animals too. Thousands of studies of primates, including humans, have revealed fascinating information about the extent of our relatedness and the evolutionary pathway that has led to the diverse array of primates on our planet today -- and this book explores every branch of this family tree of ours.</p> <p><b>THE ENDANGERED PRIMATE WORLD</b><br> Tragically, even as our knowledge of and respect for other primates has grown, so their numbers have shrunk. While reading this book, you will become aware time and again of how much the future of so many of our primate relatives is threatened by human actions. I hope that its beautifully produced pages will not only fascinate readers but also help them to realize just how endangered So many primates and their habitats are today. They need our help if they are to survive beyond this century; to this end a list of organizations working for primate conservation is included at the end of the book -- I encourage you to get involved in any way that you can. </p> <p>For many of us, the problems of species living far away seem to have little bearing on our lives. Yet the more I travel, raising awareness of the plight of Chimpanzees and other primates, the more I realize the extent to which so many seemingly disparate issues are interconnected. One obvious example is the destruction of the world's rainforests, which are disappearing at a terrifying rate. Yet even though only about 50 percent of the world's original forests remain, forest ecosystems store more than double the total amount of carbon in the atmosphere today. Thus, unless we can halt the destruction of rainforests, our own future -- as well as that of the primates and all the other species in the forest -- will be ever more acutely in jeopardy as a result of climate change.</p> <p><b>MAKING A DIFFERENCE</b><br> Many people feel helpless in the face of global problems, not realizing that they can help -- yet every one of us can make a difference, however small. As consumers and voters we have enough power to affect business practices and even government regulations. For example, palm oil is found in 10 percent of supermarket products, ranging from everyday foods to cosmetics (on which it is often listed simply as "vegetable oil") and is now also in demand for biofuels. Most of the world's palm oil comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where plantations have now replaced huge areas of natural forest, once home to orangutans and countless other species. Conservationists, realizing the scale of the crisis, stepped up their efforts to raise awareness. As a result, more and more people began to boycott products containing palm oil. The industry was thus pressured to take palm oil only from established plantations, and products containing palm oil that is clearly identified as "sustainably produced" will become increasingly available. Of course, we can support conservation efforts in other ways, such as writing to our elected representatives or to the companies themselves; and we can always make a donation to those working on the ground.</p> <p><b>THE BENEFITS OF ECOTOURISM</b><br> Those who want to become involved at a more hands-on level may wish to visit primates in their natural habitats. Even a short encounter with a Chimpanzee, a Golden Lion Tamarin, a howler monkey or any of the other wonderful primates that you will find in this book can be a life-changing experience. Responsible tourism that respects the wildlife and the culture of the local community may help to focus attention on a particular habitat and the animals living there. It may also provide jobs and a better standard of living for local people.</p> <p>The most important thing is that we, as citizens of Planet Earth, should do something to help -- the cumulative effect of small individual actions can bring about big changes. This is the most important message that I take around the world and the reason I work so hard to develop our Roots &amp; Shoots program for young people, now in nearly 100 countries. We could all wear ourselves out trying to protect primates and their habitats, but it would be of little use if we were not educating today's children to become better stewards of Earth than we have been.</p> <p>When I was a child I loved books. I used to spend hours going through old volumes on natural history, delighting in the illustrations -- black-and-white engravings for the most part. I was especially fascinated by the accounts of monkeys and apes, partly, no doubt, from reading <i>The Jungle Book</i> and the Tarzan stories. A book such as <i>The Primate Family Tree</i> gives me the same kind of pleasure today. You are in for a real treat.</p> <p><b>Jane Goodall</b><br> Founder -- Jane Goodall Institute<br> UN Messenger of Peace<br> www.janegoodall.org</p></p><h2>Healing the Unhealed Mind</h2><p>The central focus of this book is the theme of body and mind, a theme I repeatedly come back to in my teaching. It can be restated as the theme of form and content that is so often discussed in A Course in Miracles. The ego preserves it�self by having us identify with the external or physical form at the expense of the mind s content. In the context of this book, we see the ego s ingenuity in having us focus on the external symptoms of sickness, their amelioration then seen as healing. True healing, however, comes only when we let the true Healer return our attention to the mind s symptom of guilt.

Cora runs a dancing school in London, and she thinks Hilary would be perfect for her dance troupe, Wintle's Little Wonders! The only problem is that Hilary might be as good as Cora's own precious daughter, Dulcie. Still, Cora is determined to make sulky Rachel and sprightly Hilary members of the troupe.<br><br> But Rachel doesn't want to be a Little Wonder! She can't dance, and she feels silly in the ruffly costume. Nothing seems to be going as planned&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;until Rachel discovers her talent for acting.&nbsp;<br><br> This classic children's book is perfect for kids who dream of being onstage--dancing, singing, or acting. Don't miss the other classic Noel Streatfeild books&nbsp;<i>Ballet Shoes, Skating Shoes,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Dancing Shoes</i>!</p><p><b>Noel Streatfeild</b>&nbsp;was born in Sussex, England, in 1895 and was one of three sisters. Although she was considered the plain sister, she ended up leading the most glamorous and exciting life! After working in munitions factories and canteens for the armed forces when World War I broke out, Noel followed her dream of being onstage and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, where she became a professional actress. She began writing children's books in 1931, and&nbsp;<i>Ballet Shoes</i>&nbsp;was published in 1936. She quickly became one of the most popular authors of her day. According to her publisher, Penguin, fans lined up "right out of the building and all the way down the Mall" when she visited Puffin exhibitions.&nbsp;She was one of the earliest winners of the Carnegie Medal and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1983. Noel Streatfeild lived in London. She died in 1986.The School of Dancing was in North London. Outside it looked just an ordinary house, rather big perhaps for the shabby neighborhood to which it belonged. But it was anything but ordinary to the neighbors, who knew that in it were trained Mrs. Wintle's Little Wonders.<br><br> Cora Wintle had danced on the stage. She had never got beyond the chorus, for though she danced well she did not have a good figure, nor was she pretty. But she had loved the life and had found it hard to give it up when she had fallen in love and married an artist called Tom Lennox. Tom was a good painter, but a poor earner of money.<br><br> Tom and Cora had been married about a year when they had a baby. She was a little girl, and they christened her Dulcie. It was after Dulcie was born that Cora saw that if she was to bring the child up properly she must have more money than Tom was likely to earn. That was when she had her big idea. Why should she waste her dancing talent? She was getting old for chorus work and anyway she could not be away from home, but why should she not teach others to dance?<br><br> Cora was a person who usually by determination got her own way. If she had not been that type she would never have got into any chorus, for she was usually turned down at sight. But she had refused to be beaten and had worn managements down by her persistence until they had said: "Engage Cora Wintle. I'm tired of saying no."<br><br> The dancing school had its start two days after Cora had first thought of it. She was out shopping with Dulcie when by mistake she pushed the perambulator into a passer-by, a woman, not at all young but fat and cozy-looking. The woman won her way straight to Cora's heart by not being at all angry about the perambulator hitting her in the stomach but instead being rapturous about Dulcie.<br><br> "Oh, what a little love," she said in a warm, purry voice. "I've looked after many a baby in my time, but I never saw a prettier."<br><br> That conversation led to a cup of tea in a shop. There is nothing like a cup of tea for telling things. In no time Cora was explaining about Tom not earning much, and her dream of a dancing school. "I was well trained myself, and I would see any child that came to me was well trained. I shall call myself Wintle, as that's how I'm known in the theater. Tom won't mind."<br><br> The stranger, whose name was Miss Purser, then told Cora about herself. "I've been a children's Nanny since I was a slip of a girl, but now, provided I can be with children, I might give it up. My ship's come in, so to speak, only I wish it hadn't the way it has. One of my babies, the Honorable George Point . . . maybe you read of it in the papers. Eaten by a shark he was."<br><br> "Goodness," said Cora, "a shark! Just fancy, and him an Honorable too."<br><br> Miss Purser shook her head. "No respecter of persons, sharks aren't. Well, when the will was read it was found he'd left his old Nan a little money and a house, bless him. In North London the house is, not a nice part, and a great barrack of a place."<br><br> The idea hit them both at the same moment. There was Miss Purser with a house suitable for a dancing school, and wanting to be with children, and there was Cora with the training to teach children to dance. Why should they not become partners?<br><br> A few months later Cora moved her family, and Miss Purser moved herself, into Miss Purser's house. Cora put an advertisement in the local paper:<br> Cora Wintle, teacher of children for the stage.<br><br> Classes daily. 67, Ford Road, Tel. PRImrose 15150.<br> She showed the advertisement to Miss Purser, whom by then she was calling Pursey.<br><br> "How's that, Pursey?"<br><br> "Very nice, Mrs. Wintle. Now I do wonder who your first pupil will be."<br><br> It was not a pupil who first answered the advertisement but a theater manager who had liked Cora. "Is that the Cora Wintle who was on tour with my Sparklers' Company?"<br><br> Cora said it was.<br><br> "Well, I saw your advert., and I'd like to do something for an old friend. Next summer I shall want twelve kiddies for a show I'm touring round the seaside towns. You going in for troupes?"<br><br> Cora was not a person to let an opportunity pass. Even as the manager was speaking she could see troupes of children trained by her dancing all over the country. "I certainly am."<br><br> "What are you calling them, dear?"<br><br> There was a tiny pause while Cora thought hard. Then the answer came to her. "Mrs. Wintle's Little Wonders."<br><br> In ten years everybody except Tom had stopped calling Cora by her Christian name. She was Mrs. Wintle or Mrs. W. wherever she went. The school was a great success, the Little Wonders were known to everybody in the theater world, and they had appeared in films and on television. When the school started Cora had been the only dancing teacher, and Pursey had done everything else in the house. But soon there were two other teachers besides Cora--Pat and Ena--and Pursey was supposed to be only the wardrobe mistress and to employ the matrons who looked after the children when they were working. Actually Pursey never was only the wardrobe mistress, for she went on being the person everybody--staff, children, and Tom--came to whenever they wanted something, were unhappy, or had a worry.<br><br> Being the owner of the successful Little Wonders' Troupes changed Mrs. Wintle. There were plenty of other schools training children for the stage, and it meant pushing harder than anyone else to get her dancers known. A person who spends all his or her life pushing to get to the top gets tough as a result of working so hard. This happened to Mrs. Wintle. She became a rather frightening person. In fact, sometimes people said she had a stone where other people had a heart.</p><h2>Diversity, Inc.: The Failed Promise of a Billion-Dollar Business</h2><p><b> An award-winning journalist shows how workplace diversity initiatives have turned into a profoundly misguided industry--and have done little to bring equality to America's major industries and institutions. <br><br></b>Diversity has become the new buzzword, championed by elite institutions from academia to Hollywood to corporate America.

In <i>Self-Devouring Growth</i> Julie Livingston upends this notion, showing that while consumption-driven growth may seem to benefit a particular locale, it produces a number of unacknowledged, negative consequences that ripple throughout the wider world. Structuring the book as a parable in which the example of Botswana has lessons for the rest of the globe, Livingston shows how fundamental needs for water, food, and transportation become harnessed to what she calls self-devouring growth: an unchecked and unsustainable global pursuit of economic growth that threatens catastrophic environmental destruction. As Livingston notes, improved technology alone cannot stave off such destruction; what is required is a greater accounting of the web of relationships between humans, nonhuman beings, plants, and minerals that growth entails. &nbsp;Livingston contends that by failing to understand these relationships and the consequences of self-devouring growth, we may be unknowingly consuming our future.&nbsp;</p><p>Julie Livingston, a 2013 recipient of a MacArthur &#x201c;Genius Grant,&#x201d; is Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History at New York University and author of <i>Improvising Medicine: An African Oncology Ward in an Emerging Cancer Epidemic</i>, also published by Duke University Press, and <i>Debility and the Moral Imagination in Botswana</i>."Livingston has written a beautiful book, which speaks from Tswana cosmology towards the complexities of global problems, and that points towards forms of activism that we can all take forward." -- Shannon Morreira, <i>Africa Is a Country</i> Published On: 2019-10-23</p><h2>Letters To A Young Doctor (Harvest Book)</h2><p>Highly candid, insightful, and unexpectedly humorous essays on both the brutality and the beauty of the profession in which saving and losing lives is all in a day&#x2019;s work.

Passionate about books, the girl longs for a store-bought volume, but knows that the few coins her mother saves in a jar are for no-money days. Arriving in Pennsylvania, Emma, her parents, and younger siblings pick apples together, but then Mama tells her that she is to attend school now that she is eight. Nervous because she is the only "chocolate-brown" child in the class, which could not have happened in her still-segregated Florida home, Emma soon discovers the riches of the school library. Desperate to read, she takes two volumes home for the weekend, against the rules. A kind teacher and a firm but understanding mother lead to a happy ending.

And yet, it doesn't neatly fit into any of these descriptors. Buried underneath the radio-friendly exterior lie coded confessions of the subversive, wounded intelligence that gives this album its staying power as a work of art. Here Lou Reed managed to make a fun, accessible rock'n'roll record that is also a troubled meditation on the ambiguities-sexual, musical and otherwise-that defined his public persona and helped make him one of the most fascinating and influential figures in rock history.

He has released seven albums to critical acclaim. He lives in Berkeley, CA.<p>&#x201c;What Furman has written serves as more than a mere essay on Lou Reed; it&#x2019;s also a consideration of how the notion of queerness has evolved over time and what Reed meant both to queer culture and to Furman as a person.

The strategy is to maximize long run wealth of the investor by maximizing the period by period expected utility of wealth with a logarithmic utility function. Mathematical theorems show that only the log utility function maximizes asymptotic long run wealth and minimizes the expected time to arbitrary large goals. In general, the strategy is risky in the short term but as the number of bets increase, the Kelly bettor&#39;s wealth tends to be much larger than those with essentially different strategies. So most of the time, the Kelly bettor will have much more wealth than these other bettors but the Kelly strategy can lead to considerable losses a small percent of the time. There are ways to reduce this risk at the cost of lower expected final wealth using fractional Kelly strategies that blend the Kelly suggested wager with cash. The various classic reprinted papers and the new ones written specifically for this volume cover various aspects of the theory and practice of dynamic investing.

Yet there is much more to the debate than the clash of these extremes. As Thomas Dixon shows in this balanced and thought-provoking introduction, a whole range of views, subtle arguments, and fascinating perspectives can be found on this complex and centuries-old subject. He explores the key philosophical questions that underlie the debate, but also highlights the social, political, and ethical contexts that have made the tensions between science and religion such a fraught and interesting topic in the modern world. Dixon emphasizes how the modern conflict between evolution and creationism is quintessentially an American phenomenon, arising from the culture and history of the United States, as exemplified through the ongoing debates about how to interpret the First-Amendment's separation of church and state. Along the way, he examines landmark historical episodes such as the Galileo affair, Charles Darwin's own religious and scientific odyssey, the Scopes "Monkey Trial" in Tennessee in 1925, and the Dover Area School Board case of 2005, and includes perspectives from non-Christian religions and examples from across the physical, biological, and social sciences.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Each chapter in this second edition addresses a topic important to advanced oncology nursing. Key points reinforce each concept, and a case study raises relevant questions. Content correlates to the weight the Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation (ONCC) has assigned to specific topics on the certification examination and is representative of the ONCC blueprints for the advanced oncology nursing certification tests. In addition, practice test questions are offered in the final chapter in the same format as the ONCC advanced practice certification exams. The manual&#39;s editors have served as faculty for the advanced oncology nursing certification review online course as well as an in-person course at ONS national conferences. Yet the manual is more than just a study guide for test preparation. Using the most current clinical evidence and literature available at the time of publication, the topics presented have been expanded and represent a valuable resource for oncology advanced practice nurses, graduate nursing students, oncology nurses in clinical practice, and other healthcare professionals.</p><p></p><h2>Curriculum and Aims (Thinking About Education Series)</h2><p><p>The revised <em>Fifth Edition</em> of <em>Curriculum and Aims </em>provides a broad perspective on the basic curriculum questions educators face regarding the purposes, content, design, and structure of educational programs.

Despite their significant differences, Thompson and her husband, Seven, share a similar sense of adventure and a willingness to depart from the customs of their families and forge a life together on their own. Thompson explores cultural displacement through the ages and the fascinating history of Europeans in the South Pacific, beginning with Abel Tasman&#39;s discovery of New Zealand in 1642. Yet at its core, this is the story of two people who meet, fall in love, and are forever changed.</p><p>Christina Thompson is the editor of <i>Harvard Review</i>. Her essays and articles have appeared in numerous journals, including <i>American Scholar, </i>the<i> Journal of Pacific History, Australian Literary Studies,</i> and in the 1999, 2000, and 2006 editions of <i>Best Australian Essays</i>. She lives near Boston with her family.In this unusual hybrid of history and memoir, <i>Harvard Review</i> editor Thompson examines the historical collisions between Westerners and Maoris through the lens of her marriage to a Maori man. As an American grad student in Australia, Thompson met her husband-to-be, known as Seven, while on vacation in New Zealand. She was petite, blonde and intellectual; he was large, dark and working-class. Yet within a short time, they had married and started a family. Their relationship, and her scholarship, took them back and forth across the Pacific, until they finally settled in her family's New England home outside Boston. Thompson's deep knowledge of the history of Europeans in the Pacific allows her to trace the misunderstandings and stereotypes that have marked perceptions of Polynesians up to the present day. A sensitive observer and polished stylist, Thompson is never dully tendentious or dogmatic. The narrative moves smoothly by way of well-told anecdotes both personal and historical. At times, Thompson covers so much territory&#x2014;there's a stray chapter about her family's interactions with Native Americans in Minnesota&#x2014;that it can feel like she's trying to do too much, yet her prose never disappoints. Seven, the man at the center of the book, remains pleasingly opaque, as if Thompson is saying that we can never know completely even those we love best. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But then the man finds the skunk following him, and the unlikely pair embark on an increasingly frantic chase through the city, from the streets to the opera house to the fairground. What does the skunk want? It's not clear&#x2015;but soon the man has bought a new house in a new neighborhood to escape the little creature's attention, only to find himself missing something...</p><p>This sly, hilarious tale brings together luminaries Mac Barnett and Patrick McDonnell for the first time.</p></p><p><p><b>Mac Barnett</b> is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of books for children, including<i> Extra Yarn</i>, which won a 2013 Caldecott Honor and the 2012 <i>Boston Globe</i>-<i>Horn Book</i> Award for Excellence in Picture Books. He also writes the Brixton Brothers series of mystery novels. He was born in 1982 to non-farmers in a California farming community. Now he lives in Berkeley. </p><p><b>Patrick McDonnell</b> has over twenty books in print, including four <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers and the Caldecott Honor winning <i>Me...Jane</i>. His comic strip, <i>Mutts</i>, appears in over 700 newspapers around the world and on the web.</p>K-Gr 3&#x2014;A man is stalked by a silent skunk in this charmingly neurotic offering. Leaving his home one day, a bespectacled, tuxedo-clad gentleman discovers a small skunk sitting on his doorstep. As the man makes his way about town, the creature remains close on his heels ("...after a mile I realized I was being followed.") He speeds up, he slows down, he takes many wild turns, but to no avail. Still the skunk remains. Barnett's text is delivered in short, clipped sentences that convey the man's annoyance and increasing paranoia. McDonnell's distinctive pen-and-ink illustrations (the little skunk bears a striking resemblance to a couple of familiar mutts) harken back to classic comic strip humor, with expressive body language, dynamic action lines, and thoughtful compositions, creating tension and drama. The majority of the book uses a limited palette of black, peach, touches of red (notably for the skunk's oversized nose and the man's posh bow-tie), and smart use of white space. The man finally outruns his striped admirer, purchasing a new house in a different part of the city. He throws himself a fancy party with dancing and dessert. But he finds himself wondering about that skunk ("What was he doing? Was he looking for me?") Roles reverse and the pursued becomes the pursuer, as the man now slinks around corners and behind trees, surreptitiously following the skunk&#x2014;who, on the last page, looks anxiously over his shoulder at the man. Why did the skunk follow the man initially? Is this a tale of regret and missed opportunities, a lesson on the dangers of letting potential friends slip away? Of not knowing what you've got 'til it's gone? Barnett and McDonnell offer no explanations, but invite readers to ponder the possibilities. Here's hoping this talented duo pair up for many more picture book collaborations.

Please, his first book, won the 2009 American Book Award.&#x201c;Jericho Brown&#x2019;s debut collection Please resonates like aftershocks on a fault line. The poems here are hauntingly the consequence of lives lived. The silent terror in these poems is the future they seem to inform despite the attempts to integrate the incoherent with the coherent moments of lived experience. Please continually repositions its readers inside the violence of the interruption, the psychic break. To read these poems is to encounter the devastating genius of Jericho Brown: &#x2018;If I had known the location of my own runaway / Breath, I too would have found a blues.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Claudia Rankine)</p><h2>African American Pastoral Care: Revised Edition</h2><p>Respond to God&#x2019;s unfolding drama to bring healing and reconciliation.<br> <br> In this major revision of his classic book, Dr. Edward Wimberly updates his narrative methodology by examining current issues in African American pastoral care and counseling. <br> <br> "In this new edition, Ed Wimberly reconfigures what comprehensive care means for the African American struggle for dignity and proposes pastoral care approaches to the crisis of disconnection.

We are witnessing the decline and dissolution of the old order, the tumult and uncertainty of a new birth. Against this background, there is an urgent need for a coherent framework of meaning to lead us beyond the growing fragmentation of culture, belief and personal identity.</p> <p>Keiron Le Grice argues that the developing insights of a new cosmology could provide this framework, helping us to discover an underlying order shaping our life experiences. In a compelling synthesis of the ideas of seminal thinkers from depth psychology and the new paradigm sciences, Le Grice positions the new discipline of archetypal astrology at the center of an emerging world view that reunifies psyche and cosmos, spirituality and science, mythology and metaphysics, and enables us to see mythic gods, heroes and themes in a fresh light. He draws especially on the work of C. G. Jung, Joseph Campbell, Richard Tarnas, Fritjof Capra, David Bohm and Brian Swimme.</p> <p>Heralding a 'rediscovery of the gods' and the passage into a new spiritual era, The Archetypal Cosmos presents a new understanding of the role of myth and archetypal principles in our lives, one that could give a cosmic perspective and deeper meaning to our personal experiences.</p></p><p>Keiron Le Grice is&nbsp;adjunct faculty&nbsp;in the Jungian and Archetypal Studies specialization at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, California, and&nbsp;in the Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness program at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco.

As world-girdling sailors who roamed the planet on a pair of small, engineless boats that they built themselves, the Pardeys established their hard-earned reputations by eloquently (and sometimes controversially) telling their stories through a series of best-selling books and manuals, and countless seminars and boat shows. They have been called the first couple of cruising and have remained true to their mantra: Go simple, go small, go now. And after 200,000 miles of cruising under sail, they ve demonstrated that the dream of voyaging over the horizon is not only attainable, it s affordable. The children of modest, middle-class families, their message of accessibility into the world of cruising of taking your own floating home anywhere has proved irresistible to tens of thousands of sailors. Lin and Larry Pardey became cruising royalty not solely due to their impressive deeds but also through their rare ability to share what they d learned across multiple media. Seemingly every offshore cruiser knows who they are and what they represent. Or do they? In As Long as It s Fun, the biography of Lin and Larry Pardey, Herb McCormick recounts their remarkable sailing career from their early days in Southern California to their two circumnavigations to their current life in a quiet cove in New Zealand. Through interviews with their families, friends, and critics, McCormick delves deeply into the couple s often-controversial opinions, sometimes-tenuous marriage, and amazing list of accomplishments. As Long as It s Fun is as much a love story as it is a sea yarn, and, like all such stories, it s not without complications . . . which makes it not only a sailing tale but also a human one.</p><p>A sixth-generation native of Newport, Rhode Island, author Herb McCormick has been racing and cruising from above the Arctic Circle to Antarctica and chronicling his adventures and travels in magazines, newspapers, and online for more than three decades. The former editor-in-chief of Cruising World magazine and yachting correspondent for The New York Times, McCormick has notched more than 75,000 offshore miles in his sailing career. As an award-winning journalist, he s been honored with the National Marine Manufacturers Association s prestigious Directors Award and the BoatUS Monk Farnham Award for Excellence in Editorial Commentary. His stories and articles have earned numerous first-place prizes in Boating Writers International s annual writing contest. He is also the author of Out There (with George Day), an account of the first BOC Challenge solo around-the-world race; Gone to the Sea, an anthology of his best profiles and sea tales; and One Island, One Ocean, his first-person account of the historic 2009 2010 Around the Americas expedition via the Northwest Passage and Cape Horn.After nearly half a century of adventures in small boats on big oceans, sailing legends Lin and Larry Pardey have hung up their sea boots and retired to Kawau Island in New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf. You'd think that would provide time for Lin, who had a busy career writing about their exploits, to sum it up in a tell-all autobiography. For reasons unknown, the Pardeys, who have done everything their own way since first laying eyes on each other in California nearly five decades ago, farmed their last big job out. "If they told me once, they told me a hundred times, 'We want it warts and all,' " says Herb McCormick, the author of the easy-reading treasure "As Long as It's Fun." This isn't to belittle Lin Pardey's writing. Her books and articles were informative and readable. They left readers lusting after the moonlit shores, the trade winds and secluded anchorages. Yet hardened seafarers knew something was missing. What about the puking? The threats and fights, the hurricanes, the dragging anchors? As their editor for close to 30 years at the magazine Cruising World, Mr. McCormick had heard plenty of Pardey stories that didn't make it into print, and he scatters enough around the book to make the narrative downright lively. Like the time Lin spilled bottom paint all over Larry's hand-hewn teak flooring, and he threatened to kill her, then settled for just throwing her overboard. Well, what do you expect when two people spend 24 hours a day, cooped up together on a 24-foot boat with a bucket for a toilet, no electricity, no engine, no modern navigation gear and a living area about the size of a bathroom? Given all that, what the Pardeys accomplished isn't just remarkable; it's unbelievable. They started with nothing in 1965. Little Lin Zatkin, all of 4-foot-11, was doing accounting in the headquarters of Bob's Big Boy restaurants, and Larry was roaming Southern California looking for a job on a sailboat so he could gin up the cash to build a boat of his own. The attraction was mutual. When Larry took Lin to his workshop and showed her the bones of his dream, a 24-foot Lyle Hess-designed cutter he wanted to build of wood with his own hands, she bought into the whole package. Four thousand work hours later, in 1968, they launched Seraffyn, a pocket yacht so finely crafted that she carried them safely around the globe and back again and still sails today. The Pardeys left with two guiding principles, Mr. McCormick reports: They would keep going "as long as it's fun" (hence the title), and they would "go small, go simple, go now." Mr. McCormick's narrative follows their tracks and what a ride: first in Seraffyn to Mexico, Panama, the Chesapeake, trans-Atlantic to the Baltic, down to, Gibraltar, the Mediterranean, North Africa on a modest smuggling mission, the Suez Canal, Japan and back across the Pacific to America nonstop in 1978. There, Larry found a parcel of land in the California hills where he work on Seraffyn's successor, 5 feet longer but still with no engine, electronics or toilet. It took three years to build Taleisin, which carried them everywhere a sailor might aspire to go over the next quarter-century. The Pardeys reckon they put 200,000 miles under the keel, a bit more on Taleisin than Seraffyn. When they visited the Chesapeake Bay in 2000, I got the VIP tour. It was like a Steinway grand piano, so flawless was the detail, so fine the finish. Surrounded by perfection, it was tempting to imagine nothing but bliss aboard the Pardeys' pretty boat. What it really reflected, Mr. McCormick makes clear, was hard work and steely resolve, some times of terror and a lot of fun. Glorious, in the end, but not always pretty. --Angus Phillips, Wall Street Journal<br><br>I'm a sailor, I've read all their books, I thought I knew most of it. But Herb McCormick s story of the extraordinary life of Lin and Larry Pardey blew me far away. While inhabiting our world, the Pardeys discovered another one for themselves that may be the stuff of all our dreams, but is beyond the grasp of most of us. They told us that we could get there ourselves by doing as they did, but the Pardeys are hard-working, Houdini-calibre escapologists from the world the rest of us have lived in. This is in fact the rarest of tales, a story of the life two people lived that is as fabulous as the Arabian Nights, as Stanley in Africa, as any exploration of the Right Stuff in Space That s one part of this book. The other is the Pardey s singularly qualified biographer. Herb McCormick has written professionally about the sea and cruising sailors for forty years; he has sailed the globe from Polar icecap to Cape Horn, in every kind of boat and weather. No one not even the Pardeys could frame this story as clearly and contextually as Herb McCormick has in this magnificent book. This is a life story to set alongside Slocum, Scott, Amundsen, Lindberg, or Odysseus. --Peter Nichols, author of international bestsellers, Evolution s Captain and A Voyage for Madmen<p> Every story needs a storyteller. The fascinating tale of Lin and Larry Pardey stretches across nearly half a century and touches much of the earth and its oceans, shared lives pulsing with adventure, creativity and passion. Herb McCormick navigates the Pardeys sprawling journey like one of their own cutters skimming along the surface of a calm sea. They lived in many worlds and McCormick s prose slips seamlessly among them, whether describing the complexities of boat construction, the breathtaking beauty and harrowing danger of global navigation or the economics of life on the fly. Lin and Larry thrived in an esoteric life of their own making; McCormick is a genial and informed guide with an insider s knowledge and a poet s voice. In his hands, their journey is ours. --Tim Layden, Senior Writer, Sports Illustrated</p><p> Opening at an anxious moment in Taleisin near Cape Horn, Herb McCormick insightfully and vividly tells the fascinating story of the active lives and always challenging times of the most famous couple afloat. He makes clear not only how but why the Pardeys remain as colorful, controversial, and influential as ever.. --John rousemaniere - Annapolis Book of Seamanship<br><br>Ask any sailor about the names Lin and Larry Pardey and you'll receive instant recognition: they are the couple best known for their sailing exploits, their long list of popular sailing books, and a marriage that has lasted nearly fifty years. Despite all the books and DVDs and recognition, many a sailor might not know the specifics of their lives and choices: enter As Long as It's Fun, a humorous and involving biography that recounts their sailing career using interviews with families, friends and critics. It's an adventure story, it's a love story, and it will prove engaging to any who love stories of the sea. --The Midwest Book Review</p></p><h2>Transformers: IDW Collection Phase Two Volume 10</h2><p><b>Presenting IDW's <i>Transformers </i>comics in recommended reading order, including one-shots, crossovers, and event series!

These homeless dogs, plucked from the streets of Moscow, were selected because they fitted the program's criteria: weighing no more than 15 pounds, measuring no more than 14 inches in length, robust, photogenic and with a calm temperament. These characteristics enabled the dogs to withstand the extensive training that was needed to prepare them for suborbital, then for orbital, space fights. On 3 November 1957, the dog Laika was the first Earth-born creature to enter space, making her instantly famous around the world. She did not return. Her death, a few hours after launching, transformed her into a legendary symbol of sacrifice. Two further strays, Belka and Strelka, were the first beings to make it back from space, and were swiftly immortalized in children's books and cartoons. Images of the Space Dogs proliferated, reproduced on everyday goods across the Soviet Union: cigarette packets, tins of sweets, badges, stamps and postcards all bore their likenesses. <i>Soviet Space Dogs</i> uses these unique items to illustrate the story (in fact and fiction) of how they became fairytale idols. The first book to document these items, it contains more than 350 images, almost all of which are previously unpublished, and many of which have never been seen before outside Russia. The rich and varied ephemera (from cigarette packets to sweet wrappers and children's toys) of Soviet graphics will have immense appeal to the art and design market, as well as appealing to dog-lovers everywhere.</p><p>[A] brilliant book. (Sydney Parker <i>Broadly.com</i>)<br><br>Damon Murray, co-founder of FUEL Design and Publishing in London, came up with the idea to put a book together about the true story of these early space explorers.

(Tolan Rory <i>LA Review of Books</i>)<br><br>There are two reasons I couldn't resist this book. First, I was born on Oct. 5, 1957, one day after the Soviet Union sling-shotted the first satellite, Sputnik, into space. So I'm a true space age baby who grew up obsessed with the Cold War grudge match to reach the moon. Second, I was a kid during the golden age of the half-hour dog drama: television series like "Lassie," "The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin" and "The Littlest Hobo." If there had been a show called "Space Dogs," I would have been planted in front of the screen, tongue contentedly lolling.

I&#x2019;m not the founder of some groundbreaking tech invention. I haven&#x2019;t been on the cover of any business magazines or in society pages. I consider myself a pretty ordinary girl who&#x2019;s just figured out how to do some pretty extraordinary stuff in my career, making more money on my own than I ever thought I would.<br><br>The truth is, I wasn&#x2019;t dealt the greatest hand in life. Quite the contrary. My father died of a drug overdose when I was 11, and my family was far from stable (but I&#x2019;ll save that for my memoir). There were days growing up when I didn&#x2019;t have a proper meal, much less a silver spoon, to put in my mouth. When I was starting out in my career, I didn&#x2019;t have fancy connections or a big financial safety net. I simply played my hand the best I could, beat the odds, and succeeded in ways that my childhood self would never have imagined.<br><br>Along the way I fell flat on my ass . . . a lot. That is, until I learned that the only difference between stumbling blocks and stepping-stones is how you use them. In the first step of &#x201c;Being the Boss of You,&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll show you how to feel like a boss no matter where you are.<br><br>Stop Stumbling and Start Stepping<br><br>I started working pretty early, by traditional standards, with the goal of being a network news anchor. In my late teens (yes, teens), I bounced from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to Lexington, Kentucky, hustling hard for any local news gig I could get.<br><br>At 18, I thought I was ready to be on air in a &#x201c;big market.&#x201d; So I harassed a broadcasting company in Chicago that had a station in big(ish)-market Milwaukee until they would take a meeting with me. I walked in thinking I absolutely looked the part with my shoulder-padded Ann Taylor blazer that was way too big for me and hair teased to epic proportions. I didn&#x2019;t want anyone there to know how young I was, so I tried to dress older. I even developed some weird thing with my voice that I thought made me sound mature and more legit.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sure the station chief secretly laughed at my ridiculous getup and affected voice. &#x201c;Where is your accent from?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Um, Los Angeles,&#x201d; I said. Then he told me I didn&#x2019;t get the Milwaukee job. I was devastated. So devastated, in fact, that I didn&#x2019;t even pick up on the fact that he wanted to offer me another job instead.<br><br>Because I didn&#x2019;t have the aforementioned financial safety net, I would have taken any TV job I could get, including the one he was offering me in . . . business news. Yes, he offered me a job as a business reporter on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a nationally syndicated morning show in lieu of the Milwaukee one. It was a much bigger deal, but it felt like a death sentence at the time. As the daughter of immigrants, I knew nothing about money except feeling like I never had enough of it, so talking about it freaked me out. It was a topic I hated but one I was determined (and needed) to learn ASAP.<br><br>I felt like a fake when I started my on-air job as one of the youngest journalists to ever report from the floor of a stock exchange. But the truth is, we all do a little &#x201c;fake it till we make it.&#x201d; No one is ever truly ready for any big career move that comes their way. We are all terrified that we are frauds and that it&#x2019;s only a matter of time until someone finds us out. It was only once I realized that I knew more than I gave myself credit for that I could quiet the haters inside my head and take on this challenge.<br><br>Confessions of a Boss Bitch<br><br>Whacking Off<br><br>Before I started working at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, I&#x2019;d never seen a trading floor. The energy there is unlike any other: a combination of a raging nightclub, a horse auction, and a Middle Eastern bazaar.<br><br>My job was to write scripts about the latest business happenings based on the wire reports that came out every morning. I read them from atop a crate perched over the roar of a live trading pit so that the camera would actually see my face (there was a height restriction on heels women were allowed to wear on the floor . . . seriously).<br><br>I was so concerned with following the news writing style I learned in journalism school and coming up with clever puns that the gist of the actual story was sometimes totally lost on me. Except I didn&#x2019;t even realize it until my boss called me out on it.<br><br>He was the master of making me laugh even while he was criticizing me&#x2014;which happened a lot. He frequently called me into his office to watch my on-air tapes together so he could critique my work. He made fun of what he called my &#x201c;robot arms&#x201d; and mimicked my awkward anchor cadence. But nothing was as bad as the day he played me back one of my stories and said, &#x201c;Lapin, what is that story about?&#x201d;<br><br>It was a story about Gillette coming out with a new razor. So naturally, I replied: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about a new razor.&#x201d;<br><br>He then pointed me back to the tape where I was on air saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a new razor that is sharp enough to whack off the hairs closer to the skin than the previous version.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked at him quizzically. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; I was proud of myself that I had used a visual word like whack instead of something obvious like shave or remove, and I told him as much.<br><br>He started hysterically laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;What?! I thought it was more of a visual image and good writing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lapin, you&#x2019;re in business news now. You are talking to guys. Never say &#x2018;whack off&#x2019; anything,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Oh. My. God. I was mortified. And even now, recalling this story, I am cringing.<br><br>&#x201c;Whether you just made more male fans or not because you tried to be cute and clever with your words, the point is that you weren&#x2019;t thinking,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The reason we are doing the story is that Gillette is a massive publicly traded company. It is rumored that it will be acquired by the even-more-massive $100 billion (yes, BILLION) consumer products company Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G). New products move stocks, and this is a big one. That&#x2019;s why we are covering the story.&#x201d;<br><br>I was speechless. I didn&#x2019;t know whether to laugh or cry.<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Lapin, I know you know this is an important story, you don&#x2019;t need to try so hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right; you&#x2019;re the boss,&#x201d; I said, defeated and deflated.<br><br>&#x201c;Wrong,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not there day to day with you. I&#x2019;m not holding your hand. I&#x2019;m not looking at every story and walking you through it. Believe it or not, I have more to do than mock your robot arms and unfortunate use of words. I don&#x2019;t want to be the boss of your every move. You&#x2019;re the boss of that. I&#x2019;m just here to tell you when you&#x2019;re moving in a crazy direction.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded, still trying to process what he was saying, and got up to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m keeping the Gillette story for our year-end blooper reel, Lapin.&#x201d;<br><br>I forced a smile and went back to work.<br><br>I kept repeating to myself, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the boss, I&#x2019;m the boss.&#x201d; But I wasn&#x2019;t excited by that idea&#x2014;I was terrified.<br><br>It took me a few years to come to terms with what being a boss&#x2014;without technically being the boss&#x2014;actually meant. I came to see the boss mentality as a state of mind more than a title or anything else: one we can have no matter where we work or who we work for, whether it&#x2019;s a massive corporation or a three-person start-up.<br><br>You might think I&#x2019;m about to tell you that the boss mentality means having unshakable confidence and a go-getter attitude at work every day. I won&#x2019;t do that because, let&#x2019;s be serious, no one loves going to work every single day. There are shitty days, shitty people, and shitty circumstances that come everyone&#x2019;s way. Anyone who tells you they love work every. single. day. is either a damn liar or totally delusional. It&#x2019;s easy to get caught up in work drama, which can put you in a funk and make you hate your job and/or life. But if you adopt the mentality that you are the boss of you, it&#x2019;s just as easy to put your drama blinders on and fall in love with the work life you create for yourself.<br><br>As corny as acronyms can be, I am a big fan of them (and alliteration, as you&#x2019;ll see) because they help me to visualize what words and ideas mean. For me, BOSS stands for Bold, Obsessed, Self-Aware, and Strong:<br><br>BOLD. An important quality of a boss is the ability to make a decision. Right or wrong, be decisive. As they say, the road of life is paved with flattened squirrels who couldn&#x2019;t make a decision. Boss Bitches drive the car; we don&#x2019;t get driven over.<br><br>OBSESSED. Be obsessed with finding what makes you happy. Figuring out what you don&#x2019;t want to do is just as important as figuring out what you do want to do. Until then, love the shit out of everything you have an interest in.<br><br>SELF-AWARE. One of the telltale signs of the ultimate boss is someone who has total self-awareness of her flaws. We all have them. Boss Bitches don&#x2019;t hide them; we own them. We don&#x2019;t pretend we are something we are not; we flaunt the imperfect originals we are.<br><br>STRONG. Real strength is knowing that there are times when you haven&#x2019;t been your strongest, and that&#x2019;s okay. Forgive your former self for not knowing what you know now. Be kind to yourself for not being perfect, and accept the fact that you never will be.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time, but confronting my fear of business head-on and discovering my inner boss were the best things I could have done for my career. It was only then that I could use my perceived &#x201c;stumbling block&#x201d; at the Chicago exchange as a &#x201c;stepping-stone&#x201d; to my dream job at CNN.<br><br>I was all of 21 years old when I started working at CNN. And I was all of 25 when my entire division there was shut down. That meant that I was let go, along with twenty or so of my incredibly talented colleagues. I remember mourning the &#x201c;good thing&#x201d; I had going on there, but as OG Boss Bitch Marilyn Monroe said, &#x201c;Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.&#x201d;<br><br>It might sound like a high-class problem, but getting and losing my dream job so young forced me to come up with newer, bigger, and bolder dreams. And, just as unexpectedly, the ones for the rest of my career would revolve around the very subject I once feared: business.<br><br>I was all sorts of verklempt (that&#x2019;s Yiddish for &#x201c;jumbled up with emotions&#x201d;) when my agent told me about an offer to host my own two-hour global finance show on CNBC, one of the major financial news networks, making a starting salary of $150,000, which was double what I was making before. But better than the money (not that that wasn&#x2019;t nice) was having the confidence to speak the language of money fluently&#x2014;and the readiness to speak it to the world. <br><br>Needless to say, I had come a long way from the 18-year-old money-speak scaredy cat I used to be. Covering the greatest financial crisis of our time during 2008&#x2013;09 turned my proficiency in business news into real passion. <br><br>What I was not passionate about, however, was the call time. My show at CNBC started at four a.m. Yes, I had to be on the air, bright-eyed, with fake lashes, bouncy barrel curls and all, not just coherent but well-read and researched at four in the freakin&#x2019; morning. That meant I &#x201c;got up&#x201d; at midnight to get to the station and get ready physically, mentally, and intellectually.<br><br>At first I was like, &#x201c;Okay, that&#x2019;s not ideal, but it&#x2019;s such a great opportunity because four a.m. Eastern time means nine a.m. in London and five p.m. in Singapore.&#x201d; That meant pre&#x2013;trading time in the States, the open of trading in Europe, and the end of trading in Asia. That lineup was like catnip to the business lover I had become.<br><br>In the two weeks I had before starting on air, I had become a madwoman, preparing pitches for all of the series I wanted to do. I felt like a boss going into the job not only ready to rock my show, which was a combination of anchoring major headlines and interviews with CEOs and politicians, but also poised to create entrepreneurial reports after it wrapped.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never lie to you: the &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the boss&#x201d; mentality didn&#x2019;t come out all day, every day, but I tried to channel it most days. I was a totally different woman from the terrified and confused one I was when I walked out of my boss&#x2019;s office after being chastised for saying &#x201c;whack off&#x201d; on national television. Reminding myself that I was the boss helped me keep a positive attitude during the less-than-ideal hours.<br><br>Over the next year, I launched special series like &#x201c;Made in America,&#x201d; which followed companies that kept manufacturing in the United States even if it was more expensive, and &#x201c;States of Pain,&#x201d; which took me from the governor&#x2019;s mansion in Seattle to the statehouse in Maine as I tried to figure out why states were in so much financial trouble. I also took my show on the road to LA and DC, which had never been done before.<br><br>Needless to say, I was burning the candle at both ends. I got to the studio at one a.m. and wrapped around nine or ten a.m., then would literally jump on the first flight to whichever source I needed for the series, do my interview, and jump back on a plane to make my call time back at the network later that night. There were times when I didn&#x2019;t sleep for days. The travel and my perpetual zombielike state took a massive toll on my body. But I didn&#x2019;t complain. I really wouldn&#x2019;t have had it any other way. The stories I came up with and the content I created made all the wear and tear worth it. It made the job my own.</p><h2>The Killing Forest (Louise Rick Series, 8)</h2><p><b> #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER<br>Sara Blaedel, author of the #1 international bestseller <i>The Forgotten Girls</i>--which was roundly praised as "gripping" with "uncompromising realism" (<i>Washington Post</i>) and "tautly suspenseful" (<i>BookPage</i>)--returns with the thrilling next book in her series featuring police investigator Louise Rick.</b><br><br>Following an extended leave, Louise Rick returns to work at the Special Search Agency, an elite unit of the National Police Department.

The British government finally agrees to send a brigade of 5,000 Jewish volunteers from Palestine to Europe to fight the German army. But when the war ends and the soldiers witness firsthand the horrors their people have suffered in the concentration camps, the men launch a brutal and calculating campaign of vengeance, forming secret squads to identify, locate, and kill Nazi officers in hiding. Their own ferocity threatens to overwhelm them until a fortuitous encounter with an orphaned girl sets the men on a course of action&#x2014;rescuing Jewish war orphans and transporting them to Palestine&#x2014;that will not only change their lives but also help create a nation and forever alter the course of world history.</p></p><p><p>Howard Blum is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and Edgar Award winner <em>American Lightning</em>, as well as <em>Wanted!</em>, <em>The Gold of Exodus</em>, <em>Gangland</em>, <em>The Floor of Heaven, </em>and, most recently,&nbsp;a&nbsp;2018 <em>New York Times </em>Notable Book<em>: In the Enemy's House</em>. Blum is a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em>. While at the <em>New York Times</em>, he was twice nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. He is the father of three children, and lives in Connecticut. </p>Although the official history of the Jewish Brigade Group (a unit of some 5,000 Jews who fought with the British Eighth Army in Italy in the waning months of the conflict) has been written, Blum (Wanted! The Search for Nazis in America) breaks new ground by looking into the clandestine operations that occurred after the shooting had stopped. Once they learned the true extent of the holocaust, soldiers of the brigade began using intelligence reports to pinpoint the location of former SS officers and camp guards. The enraged Jewish troops took vengeance into their own hands, eventually slaying hundreds of Nazi death dealers. Blum follows the story of three men Israel Carmi, Johanan Peltz and Arie Pinchuk in detail, interviewed dozens of others, read unpublished personal memoirs and had Hebrew-language documents translated for him. During the war, the more daring Jewish soldiers formed a secret unit that appropriated British supplies trucks, weapons and food and diverted them to ships heading illegally for Palestine The plan included the "repatriation" of thousands of war orphans, who were clandestinely taken from displaced person camps and smuggled to Palestine. The underground Jewish Haganah figured prominently in these operations, which contributed directly to the creation of Israel. Blum, twice nominated for a Pulitzer as a New York Times investigative reporter, and now a Vanity Fair contributing editor, presents the material masterfully, building suspense and carefully documenting all the action. 16 pages of photos not seen by PW.

So when France sold Iraq a top-of-the-line nuclear reactor in 1975, the Israelis were justifiably concerned&#x2014;especially when they discovered that Iraqi scientists had already formulated a secret program to extract weapons-grade plutonium from the reactor, a first critical step in creating an atomic bomb. The reactor formed the heart of a huge nuclear plant situated twelve miles from Baghdad, 1,100 kilometers from Tel Aviv. By 1981, the reactor was on the verge of becoming &#x201c;hot,&#x201d; and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin knew he would have to confront its deadly potential. He turned to Israeli Air Force commander General David Ivry to secretly plan a daring surgical strike on the reactor&#x2014;a never-before-contemplated mission that would prove to be one of the most remarkable military operations of all time.<br><br>Written with the full and exclusive cooperation of the Israeli Air Force high command, General Ivry (ret.), and all of the eight mission pilots (including Ilan Ramon, who become Israel&#x2019;s first astronaut and perished tragically in the shuttle Columbia disaster), <i>Raid on the Sun</i> tells the extraordinary story of how Israel plotted the unthinkable: defying its U.S. and European allies to eliminate Iraq&#x2019;s nuclear threat. In the tradition of <i>Black Hawk Down</i>, journalist Rodger Claire re-creates a gripping tale of personal sacrifice and survival, of young pilots who trained in the United States on the then-new, radically sophisticated F-16 fighter bombers, then faced a nearly insurmountable challenge: how to fly the 1,000-plus-kilometer mission to Baghdad and back on one tank of fuel. He recounts Israeli intelligence&#x2019;s incredible &#x201c;black ops&#x201d; to sabotage construction on the French reactor and eliminate Iraqi nuclear scientists, and he gives the reader a pilot&#x2019;s-eye view of the action on June 7, 1981, when the planes roared off a runway on the Sinai Peninsula for the first successful destruction of a nuclear reactor in history.</p><p>Rodger W. Claire, a former magazine editor, is the first journalist to have been granted complete access to all of the individuals involved in the raid on Osirak and to classified materials detailing it. The author of numerous articles and two screenplays, he lives in Los Angeles.CHAPTER 1<br>TERROR OF THE TIGRIS<br><i>Prepare whatever resources and troops you must to terrorize the enemies of God</i>.<br>--the qur'an<br>Before the birth of its First Citizen, the flat, dusty village of Al Auja, just south of Tikrit and a hundred miles north of nowhere in the Mesopotamian desert, was best known to historians as the site where the vicious fourteenth-century Tartar chieftain Tamerlane chose to erect his infamous pyramid of skulls, a towering obelisk of death fashioned from the decapitated heads of thousands of slaughtered Persian soldiers. In an ironically unconscious homage, Saddam Hussein, who didn't know Tamerlane from Timbuktu, would one day commission his own public sculpture in Baghdad featuring two gigantic arms bursting through the sand brandishing a pair of crossed scimitars that crowned a similar pyramid of skulls fashioned from the helmets of thousands of slaughtered twentieth-century Persian soldiers, known now in modern times as Iranians.<br><br>It was into this savagely unforgiving desert that young Saddam, whose name in Arabic means to "strike" or "punch," was thrust on April 28, 1937, fatherless and penniless, to be reared in a mud-and-straw house on the kiln-hot banks of the Tigris, without electricity, running water, or paved roads. Hussein would never forget his Tikriti roots. As though drawing inspiration from the land itself, he was mesmerized as a village boy by the country's ancient glory when it sat at the head of the Fertile Crescent, long before Abraham marched south from Ur in northern Mesopotamia to lay claim to the tribal homeland of the Semites. Much more than Iraq's later Islamic heritage, divided between the Sunni sects of the north and Shia of the south, Saddam identified with the country's pre-Arab Babylonian roots. He revered the great Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, whose golden age of prosperity had transformed ancient Baghdad into an intellectual center of trade and the arts, renowned throughout the Old World for such wonders as its legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Even more impressive to young Saddam, Nebuchadnezzar was the last Middle Eastern ruler to conquer the Jews. Following a revolt in Palestine in 587 b.c., Nebuchadnezzar's army had destroyed Jerusalem, razing the First Temple and bringing an end to the kingdom of Judea. Thousands of Jews were marched in bondage back to Mesopotamia in what would become known in Talmudic history as the Babylonian captivity.<br><br>Hussein loved to recount the historic event to colleagues. And he would boast that someday he would follow in the footsteps of the legendary king to rule both the Middle East and Israel. Indeed, years later, after he had assumed regal-like powers, Hussein would embark on a Baghdad beautification program of public artworks, broad boulevards, and thousands of transplanted palm trees meant to evoke the great age of Nebuchadnezzar. Hussein named his sons Udai and Qusai, not names associated with Mohammed but with pre-Islamic Mesopotamia.<br><br>Maintaining fantastic dreams was especially important to young Saddam, who found his own reality nearly unbearable. Iraq was a tangled nation of tribes and clans and ethnic divisions. Where one was born and to what clan, or extended family, was extremely important, even in the poorer classes of Iraqi society. Surnames often derived from the village of one's clan. Most families could trace their forbears back for generations. Saddam's parents were not particularly distinguished members of either of their clans. Al Auja and Tikrit were considered backward, rural villages, and Tikritis of little account. Saddam's father's clan, the al-Majid, was considered lower caste.<br><br>Whether dead or just plain deadbeat--no one has ever seemed able to say for sure--Saddam's biological father left his son to be raised by his mother, Sabha, of the Tikriti Talfah clan, and a series of uncles, including one from his father's al-Majid clan named Ibrahim Hassan, who, regrettably, was better known to locals as "Hassan the Liar." (Tellingly, Saddam Hussein ultimately took his name from neither family--Talfah or Hassan.) Ibrahim eventually married Sabha and, with no trade and plenty of time, amused himself by beating young Saddam with a stick whenever he was bored, which, unfortunately for the boy, was often. He grew up mostly alone, forbidden to play with the other villagers, whom his uncle called "brigands," and who, in return, would taunt him for not having a "real" father. Saddam pined for the day he could escape Tikrit for a better world--a Mesopotamian world. In the meantime he bided his time, spending most days sitting by the side of the dirt road at the head of the village next to a fire pit with a red-hot poker, which he would stab into the stomachs of hapless village dogs that wandered by. This early cruel streak might have been occasion for worry, but on the sun-blasted streets of dirt-poor Tikrit it hardly went noticed.<br><br>Saddam finally caught a break when, in the fall of 1955, his mother's more prosperous brother, Khairallah Talfah, an ex-army officer turned hotheaded Arab nationalist and teacher, took Hussein along with his own son to Baghdad to attend secondary school. Saddam had just turned eighteen. Baghdad would change him forever.<br><br>In the early 1950s the city was a hotbed of ethnic and political radicalism. Iraq, which in Arabic means "the edge," was an amalgam of deeply divided tribes and ethnicities, the remnant of the defunct Ottoman Empire and Britain's Central Asian empire, which, following World War I, had been carved up into Iran and Iraq without taking into account traditionally and ethnically bound territories. Thus, most of southern Iraq, nearly 100 percent Shi'ite, had more in common with Iran than its Sunni "brothers" in the north. In fact, Iranian Shi'ites still revered two southern Iraqi cities as sacred religious shrines, including Najaf, the burial place of Mohammed's son-in-law, Al, (and the site of the horrendous terrorist bombing of its ancient mosque in August 2003). Meanwhile, distrustful of both the ruling Sunni and the southern Shi'ites were the northern Kurds, who were far closer in history and culture to the Kurdish tribes across the border in Turkey. By the 1950s Baghdad's tangle of ethnic divisions was further complicated by a slew of competing political parties, ranging from the Hashemite monarchists (the royal Arab family that ruled Jordan and whose scion, Prince Faisal, Britain had elected to rule Iraq in its stead), the right-wing Independence Party, and the centrist Liberal Party to the leftist People's Party, the Communist Party, and the secretive, socialist Arab nationalist Ba'th, or "Renaissance," Party.<br><br>Despite tutoring by his uncle, Saddam found it difficult to shed his peasant roots in the class-conscious big city, especially the crude accent that marked a rural Tikriti as unmistakably as a Cockney in St. James's Court. He failed to pass the entrance exam to join the prestigious Baghdad Military Academy. The stigma of outcast propelled Hussein, along with many of the city's disenchanted youth, toward the young, rebellious, socialist Ba'th Party. Founded in Damascus by two Syrian intellectuals in the early 1940s, the organization espoused vaguely pan-Arab nationalist and socialist principles similar to Egyptian president Gamal Nasser's Arab Legion. But the party's immediate attraction to Baghdad's frustrated young rebels was its intense hatred of Western colonialism, especially what it saw as its expansionist guerrilla state--Israel.<br><br>Hussein hagiographies would later attribute his party association to his newfound belief in Islamic nationalism. In truth, the impressionable peasant's son was greatly influenced by his uncle Khairallah, who having been jailed by the British for his part in Baghdad's short-lived pro-Mussolini revolt in 1941, was the closest thing Saddam had to a hero. Khairallah mentored him in the tradecraft of Iraqi politicians: manipulation, intrigue, and anti-Semitism. Not one for mincing words, Khairallah's collective wisdom would later be published for the benefit of future Ba'thi in his book Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews, and Flies.<br><br>Hanging around political meetings and outdoor rallies, Saddam eventually caught the attention of Ba'thist officials, who spotted a use for the young man's brooding, sadistic personality. They soon put him in charge of recruiting schoolmates and organizing local street bullies into brownshirtlike gangs to intimidate shopkeepers and the suburban middle class. Saddam became a familiar figure at Ba'th street demonstrations and public beatings, where he would stand off to the side, ordering his thug warriors into the fray or pointing out local tradesmen to be beaten. Things changed radically on July 14, 1958, when Gen. Abdul Karim Qassem and his "Free Officers" Brigade, backed by the Ba'th Party, marched into Baghdad and overthrew King Faisal and the fading Hashemite monarchy. It was a remarkably vicious coup, even by Iraqi standards, the carnage sinking to a new nadir when wild-eyed, rampaging mobs--waving sticks and swords and rushing up and down alleys looking for people to punish--discovered the whereabouts of the body of the just-murdered prime minister Nuri al-Said. The crowd promptly dug up the corpse and dragged it through the streets of Baghdad on a rope. (The scene would ironically be reenacted, at least symbolically, forty-five years later when, at the end of the Iraq War, Baghdad mobs, unable to find the real, live Saddam, made do by pulling down the famed statue of their erstwhile leader and then dragging it through the streets at the end of a rope.) Indeed, Saddam watched this day from the sidelines, but the rising twenty-one-year-old politico could not help but learn a valuable lesson he would not soon forget about the true nature of power in Iraq--and the loss of it.<br>One year later Saddam found himself waiting on a darkening Baghdad street not far from the West German embassy. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, awkwardly trying to conceal the submachine gun beneath his cloak. How far Hussein had advanced in the Ba'th Party was confirmed by his selection as part of the hit team to assassinate the repressive Prime Minister Qassem, who had fallen out of favor with the radical Ba'this. As Qassem's car pulled to the curb on the other side of the street, a deafening blast of machine gun fire mowed down everything in sight, bodyguards and hit men alike, throwing the scene into bedlam. In the ensuing confusion the prime minister's bodyguards, recovering from their initial shock, shoved Qassem into a passing taxi, which rushed him safely to the hospital.<br><br>As the official legend would later explain the apparent screw-up, Saddam, "when he found himself face to face with the dictator, was unable to restrain himself. He forgot all his instructions and opened fire." Saddam's job, in fact, was simply to provide cover for the hit men, who were to converge on the car from two sides and liquidate Qassem. Instead, Saddam panicked and opened fire on everyone, including fellow conspirator Abdul-Whahab al-Ghariri, who managed only two shots, one into Qassem's shoulder, before being dropped by Saddam's deadly fusillade. In the counterfire, Hussein was wounded in the leg and fled for his life, leaving behind al-Ghariri, who was quickly identified by Qassem's security team. Al-Ghariri's name led them to the rest of the team, and in short order Qassem's agents were hunting down one by one the surviving conspirators, including Saddam.<br><br>Again, according to the official Ba'thist story, Saddam, in pain and under sentence of death, dug the bullet out of his leg with a knife and, helped by kindly nomadic Bedouins and simple peasants, limped his way to Tikrit disguised as an Arab wanderer. In truth, a local doctor removed the bullet, and Saddam's uncle helped him cross the border by car into Syria and then finally to Cairo, where Ba'th Party loyalists took the young rebel in and enrolled him at the university.<br><br>For the next decade Hussein lived meagerly in a modest student tenement building not far from Cairo University, where he took up studying law. He was supported by a monthly government stipend granted by Egyptian president Gamal Nasser's regime, which had made Cairo a safe harbor and side station for revolutionaries and Arab nationalist dissidents from across the Middle East. For most of the next decade, Saddam lived cheaply and spent his time studying and working for the Ba'th Party. Occasionally, when the young Arab nationalist would run short of funds, the kindhearted bawab, or porter, of his building would loan him money. (Years later, after Saddam rose to power, he sent to Cairo for the old bawab and bestowed upon him a brand-new house as a reward for his earlier kindnesses.) The many dissident exiles in Cairo grew together to form a tight-knit community of idealists and revolutionaries. Sporting ethnic kaffiyehs and colorful regional dress from their various nations of exile, the foreign students, dissidents, and party chiefs gathered regularly in the capital's downtown caf*s and coffeehouses to argue politics and promote socialism and pan-Arab nationalism. Among the most strident of the Arab one-worlders was Saddam Hussein, who lobbied loudly and tirelessly for his Ba'th Party back in Iraq.<br><br>In 1968, the Iraqi Ba'th Party finalized secret plans to take over the Iraqi government. Saddam promptly left his law studies and returned to Iraq to help foment the revolution. Hussein worked his way up the ranks to become head of the Ba'th security brigade, whose function was to eliminate enemies and protect party leaders, among them Saddam's cousin, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, a former schoolteacher who had become head of the Iraqi Ba'th. Adapting his own version of the carrot and stick--tarhib and targhid ("terror" and "enticement")--Hussein formed friendships and alliances when they furthered his career and broke them when they did not. He displayed a gift for understanding human nature at its most basic level and grasped early on that physical punishment was a great motivator, but fear of physical punishment was even greater. He found he had only to make one or two particularly dramatic examples and a reputation for his ruthlessness and retribution would grow by itself--the myth, in fact, far outstripping the reality. Years later, after he had become a complete tyrant, Hussein arrested a general, Omar al-Hazzaa, who had been heard to speak badly about him. He did not just sentence al-Hazzaa to death. Saddam first had al-Hazzaa's tongue cut out and then had his son executed as well. His home was bulldozed flat and his wife and surviving children turned out on the street. Such horrors, Hussein found, were a much greater deterrent than simply planting the general in the ground.<br><br>The macabre, almost routine cycle of bloodbaths in Baghdad finally came to an end at three o'clock in the morning, July 17, 1968, when the Ba'thists stormed the presidential palace and ousted Qassem, and al-Bakr, the new prime minister and commander in chief, proclaimed the Age of Revolution.<br><br>It would be another year before Saddam would emerge from the shadows behind the al-Bakr throne. Then it was revealed that Saddam was second in command to his uncle, vice president of the secretive, all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council--and had been since the earliest days of the regime.</p><h2>Dark Days: A Memoir</h2><p><b>Lamb of god vocalist D. Randall Blythe finally tells the whole incredible story of his arrest, incarceration, trial, and acquittal for manslaughter in the Czech Republic over the tragic and accidental death of a concertgoer in this riveting, gripping, biting, bold, and brave memoir.</b><br><br>On June 27, 2012, the long-running, hard-touring, and world-renowned metal band lamb of god landed in Prague for their first concert there in two years. Vocalist D. Randall "Randy" Blythe was looking forward to a few hours off&#x2014;a rare break from the touring grind&#x2014;in which to explore the elegant, old city. However, a surreal scenario worthy of Kafka began to play out at the airport as Blythe was detained, arrested for manslaughter, and taken to Pankr�c Prison&#x2014;a notorious 123-year-old institution where the Nazis' torture units had set up camp during the German occupation of then-Czechoslovakia, and where today hundreds of prisoners are housed, awaiting trial and serving sentences in claustrophobic, sweltering, nightmare-inducing conditions.<br><br>Two years prior, a 19-year-old fan died of injuries suffered at a lamb of god show in Prague, allegedly after being pushed off stage by Blythe, who had no vivid recollection of the incident. Stage-crashing and -diving being not uncommon occurrences, as any veteran of hard rock, metal, and punk shows knows, the concert that could have left him imprisoned for years was but a vague blur in Blythe's memory, just one of the hundreds of shows his band had performed over their decades-long career.<br><br>At the time of his arrest Blythe had been sober for nearly two years, having finally gained the upper hand over the alcoholism that nearly killed him. But here he faced a new kind of challenge: jailed in a foreign land and facing a prison sentence of up to ten years. Worst of all, a young man was dead, and Blythe was devastated for him and his family, even as the reality of his own situation began to close in behind Pankr�c Prison's glowering walls of crumbling concrete and razor wire.<br><br>What transpired during Blythe's incarceration, trial, and eventual acquittal is a rock 'n' roll road story unlike any other, one that runs the gamut from tragedy to despair to hope and finally to redemption. While never losing sight of the sad gravity of his situation, Blythe relates the tale of his ordeal with one eye fixed firmly on the absurd (and at times bizarrely hilarious) circumstances he encountered along the way. Blythe is a natural storyteller and his voice drips with cutting humor, endearing empathy, and soulful insight. Much more than a tour diary or a prison memoir, <i>Dark Days</i> is D. Randall Blythe's own story about what went down&#x2014;before, during, and after&#x2014;told only as he can.<br><br></p><p><b>D.

Both, says Bryan Chapell, are sadly missing the bigger picture, that <i>God</i> is the hero of this story and he is in the midst of his unrelenting plan to rescue his people from their sin and its consequences. We mustn't simply make the man Daniel the object of our worship nor the subject of our debates. We may differ about prophetic details, Chapell says, but we should never miss the point that the book of Daniel is, like all of Old Testament Scripture, pointing us toward the grace of God, ultimately revealed in Christ.<br><br>Pastors, teachers, and individual Christians studying the book of Daniel will find this volume a welcome addition to their library.</p><p><b>The book of Daniel isn't ultimately about Daniel--it's about the gospel of Jesus.<br></b><br>Often we read the book of Daniel in one of two ways--either as a book about a heroic man whose righteousness should inspire us to keep the faith, or as a roadmap to the end times that can, through careful study, tell us the day and hour (or nearly so) of Christ's return.

One of Britain&#x2019;s most esteemed gardening writers recounts how she and her husband set about creating an exemplary cottage garden from unpromising beginnings on the site of the former farmyard and rubbish heap that surround their newly purchased home in the countryside of Somerset, England. Each imbued with a strong set of horticultural opinions and passions, Mr. and Mrs. Fish negotiate the terrain of their garden, by turns separately and together, often with humorous collisions. From the secret to cultivating the smoothest lawn to the art of lifting and replanting tulip bulbs to the landscaping possibilities of evergreens, the diverse elements of successful gardening&#x2014;and delightful writing&#x2014;are bound together by Mr. and Mrs. Fish&#x2019;s aspiration to cultivate that most precious and slow-growing quality&#x2014;the fundamental character of a good garden.</p><p>Just in time for the 40th anniversary of its original publication, Margery Fish's classic gardening memoir has been published in the United States for the first time. Fish and her husband Walter, a former editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, bought a dilapidated house and two acres of limey clay in Somerset in 1937, fearing the onset of war. For the next two decades, they cultivated, pruned, and watered, with Walter providing the direction and the sense of order and Margery the flowers, the unstructured flora, and the wry observations. As in all of the best gardening books, Fish's memoir leavens technical information on gardening with memory and reflection. The book is above all the story of a marriage within the story of a landscape. Walter's lectures on the importance of structure, the distant war, the hardships of postwar England, come through slightly muted, like the outlines of buildings seen through dense foliage.A charming account of how Margery Fish &amp; her husband created a cottage garden from an overgrown farmyard. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Michael Pollan said: "Much more than a period piece, We Made a Garden is a gentle reminder that plants are only a small part of what a garden is.

But then the lines between these two worlds begin to blur. Is that a militant Red Cross Nurse demanding that Alice get <i>BACK. TO. HER.

Klimt and His Cat is the firstbook she has also authored. B�r�nice lives inMilan, Italy.Grade 2-6&#x2013;Klimt, founder of the late-19th-century Secessionist Art Movement in Vienna, probably has greater renown in Europe than in the U.S. However, American children will enjoy this aesthetically pleasing fictional biography as told by the artist's cat, Katze. The feline takes readers into Klimt's studio to see the decorative, stylized paintings. Then, through conversations and the cat's observations, readers gain insight into the artist's personality, thoughts, and philosophy on art and life. None of this is as heavy as it might seem, given Klimt's erotic and psychological preoccupations. The cat's tale is much softer, much lighter&#x2013;a child's interpretation of the paintings. There is no dumbing down&#x2013;just appreciation from a different perspective. The mixed-media illustrations work wonderfully with the story. Done in the decorative, ornamental style of Klimt himself, they shine with gold, rich fabrics, paint, and photographs. The effect is as dazzling as his originals. They invite study and appreciation. Readers will need to look twice to distinguish between the illustrations and the reproductions of Klimt's paintings included at the book's conclusion. This richly illustrated, sophisticated work is a beautiful addition to picture-book collections.<i>&#x2013;Carolyn Janssen, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book approaches optimization from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints. Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. </p><p>Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science, any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a reference for professionals.</p></p><p>Mykel J.

He had a talent for drawing and an interest in birds, and he would spend the next thirty-five years traveling to the remotest regions of his new country&#x2013;often alone and on foot&#x2013;to render his avian subjects on paper. The works of art he created gave the world its idea of America. They gave America its idea of itself. <br><br>Here Richard Rhodes vividly depicts Audubon&#x2019;s life and career: his epic wanderings; his quest to portray birds in a lifelike way; his long, anguished separations from his adored wife; his ambivalent witness to the vanishing of the wilderness. <i>John James Audubon: The Making of an American</i> is a magnificent achievement.</p><p>From the Pulitzer Prize--winning historian Richard Rhodes, the first major biography of John James Audubon in forty years, and the first to illuminate fully the private and family life of the master illustrator of the natural world. <br>Rhodes shows us young Audubon arriving in New York from France in 1803, his illegitimacy a painful secret, speaking no English but already drawing and observing birds. We see him falling in love, marrying the wellborn English girl next door, crossing the Appalachians to frontier Kentucky to start a new life, fashioning himself into an American just as his adopted country was finding its identity. <br>Here is Audubon exploring the wilderness of birds-pelicans wading the shallows of interior rivers, songbirds flocking, passenger pigeons darkening the skies-and teaching himself to revivify them in glorious life-size images. Now he finds his calling: to take his hundreds of watercolor drawings to England to be engraved in a great multivolume work called "The Birds of America. Within weeks of his arrival there in 1826, he achieves remarkable celebrity as "the American Woodsman." He publishes his major work as well as five volumes of bird biographies enhanced by his authentic descriptions of pioneer American life. <br>Audubon's story is an artist's story but also a moving love story. In his day, communications by letter across the ocean were so slow and uncertain that John James and his wife, Lucy, almost lost each other in the three years when the Atlantic separated them-until he crossed the Atlantic and half the American continent to claim her. Their letters during this time are intimate, moving, and painful, and they attest to an enduring love. <br>Weexamine Audubon's legacy of inspired observation-the sonorities of a wilderness now lost, the brash life of a new nation just inventing itself-precisely, truthfully, lyrically captured. And we see Audubon in the fullness of his years, made rich by his magnificent work, winning public honor: embraced by writers and scientists, feted by presidents and royalty. <br>Here is a revelation of Audubon as the major American artist he is. And here he emerges for the first time in his full humanity-handsome, charming, volatile, ambitious, loving, canny, immensely energetic. Richard Rhodes has given us an indispensable portrait of a true American icon. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>Richard Rhodes is the author of twenty books, including novels and works of history, journalism and letters.

It is filled with hilarious anecdotes, behind the scenes dealing, and simply great hockey. It tells the story of Bobby Hull&#x2019;s astonishing million-dollar signing, which helped launch the league, and how he lost his toupee in an on-ice scrap.It explains how a team of naked Birmingham Bulls ended up in an arena concourse spoiling for a brawl. How the Oilers had to smuggle fugitive forward Frankie &#x201c;Seldom&#x201d; Beaton out of their dressing room in an equipment bag. And how Mark Howe sometimes forgot not to yell &#x201c;Dad!&#x201d; when he called for his teammate father, Gordie, to pass. There&#x2019;s the making of <i>Slap Shot</i>, that classic of modern cinema, and the making of the virtuoso line of Hull, Anders Hedberg, and Ulf Nilsson.<br><br>It began as the moneymaking scheme of two California lawyers. They didn&#x2019;t know much about hockey, but they sure knew how to shake things up. The upstart WHA introduced to the world 27 new hockey franchises, a trail of bounced cheques, fractious lawsuits, and folded teams. It introduced the crackpots, goons, and crazies that are so well remembered as the league&#x2019;s bizarre legacy.<br><br>But the hit-and-miss league was much more than a travelling circus of the weird and wonderful. It was the vanguard that drove hockey into the modern age. It ended the NHL&#x2019;s monopoly, freed players from the reserve clause, ushered in the 18-year-old draft, moved the game into the Sun Belt, and put European players on the ice in numbers previously unimagined.<br><br>The rebel league of the WHA gave shining stars their big-league debut and others their swan song, and provided high-octane fuel for some spectacular flameouts. By the end of its seven years, there were just six teams left standing, four of which &#x2013; the Winnipeg Jets, Quebec Nordiques, Edmonton Oilers, and Hartford Whalers &#x2013; would wind up in the expanded NHL.</p><p><b>Ed Willes</b> was the hockey writer for the <i>Winnipeg Sun,</i> for eight years. In 1997-98, he worked as a freelancer out of Montreal and ended up writing for the <i>New York Times.</i> That summer he was offered the sports columnist job at the <i>Vancouver Province,</i> where he&#x2019;s been ever since. He lives in North Vancouver, B.C.He probably didn&#x2019;t think it would be an issue when he joined the WHA, but in addition to his many other personality quirks Mike Walton was deathly afraid of spiders, cockroaches, and anything else that crawled and had six or more legs. Sadly, this phobia qualified as something of an occupational hazard for Shaky, because the new league, in the early years at least, played in places that did not discourage the presence of insects.<br><br>The Sam Houston Arena, for instance, built in 1937 and famous for its Friday-night wrestling cards, was fairly typical of the first generation of WHA rinks. Owner Paul Deneau invested enough money to bring it up to code and even installed Plexiglas in place of the chicken wire that was still in use in many of the old rinks. &#x201c;I thought it was okay,&#x201d; says Dineen.<br><br>Still, no one was mistaking it for Madison Square Garden.<br><br>&#x201c;We used to have cockroach contests in the dressing room,&#x201d; says John Garrett. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d be putting our equipment on, and a cockroach always got in your skates or your sweater. If you got a really big one, you&#x2019;d hang it from a skate lace in the middle of the dressing room. Then the other guys would try to get a bigger one. There was no money involved. We just did it for the honour.&#x201d;<br><br>Which was funny to everyone except Walton. During one road trip, the Saints played in Houston before taking off immediately for Baltimore. The accepted WHA procedure after a game in Houston was to shake your equipment vigorously to dislodge any unwanted guests, who could, if left unattended, multiply and eat your brain. Walton, sadly, forgot this safety precaution, which caused some excitement when he took his skates out of his bag in Baltimore.<br><br>&#x201c;I was in the coaches&#x2019; room and I heard this horrible scream coming from the dressing room,&#x201d; says Harry Neale. &#x201c;I thought, Oh my god, someone&#x2019;s cut their hand off. Then I see this cockroach coming out of our dressing room and I figured out what had happened.<br><br>&#x201c;I think the cockroach made the rest of the road trip with us and he didn&#x2019;t ask for a per diem so we kept him around.&#x201d;<br><br>The pioneers of the new league would experience many such indignities in the WHA&#x2019;s seven�year existence. While they were grateful for the opportunity, to say nothing of the paycheques, NHL veterans who&#x2019;d lived the life in <i>The Show</i> would often look at their surroundings and ask the great existential question, &#x201c;Just what the hell am I doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>Some of them never received a satisfactory answer. But the journeymen and minor-leaguers endured the league&#x2019;s more unusual aspects with patience and humour, because they knew the WHA was infinitely superior to the alternative.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t like Keon, McKenzie, or Walton,&#x201d; says Dave Hanson. &#x201c;I had nothing to compare it to. I just thought this was the way things were, and it was a great adventure. We had a lot of fun.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the WHA&#x2019;s biggest sources of amusement was its buildings. In time, the rebels could boast a series of new arenas that were years ahead of the NHL&#x2019;s and foreshadowed the great steel-and�glass mausoleums of today. There was the new St. Paul Civic Center. The Oilers moved into Northlands Coliseum midway through Year 3. The Indianapolis Racers played in the magnificent new Market Square Arena. Nick Mileti would build a new facility for the Cleveland Crusaders in Richfield that, at the time, was the most luxurious in hockey. Cincinnati and New England would also move into new buildings. But over the first couple of years, the league was jammed into a collection of dusty old pre-war rinks that, while not without their own charms, fell somewhat short of big-league.<br><br>&#x201c;You just saw things in the WHA you never saw anywhere else,&#x201d; says Paul Shmyr.<br><br>And Shmyr knows whereof he speaks. The defenceman played in all seven years of the WHA, his first four in Cleveland as the Crusaders&#x2019; captain. In his first two seasons, the Crusaders played out of the old Cleveland Arena in an area of town that was scarier than <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>. Five Crusaders had their cars stolen out of the parking lot at the Arena, and two of them, Wayne Muloin and Tom Edur, lost new Thunderbirds on the same night. Steve Thomas, the Crusaders&#x2019; trainer, was mugged three times one winter. A would-be thief demanded Thomas&#x2019;s watch. &#x201c;They got that last week,&#x201d; Thomas answered.<br><br>&#x201c;It was a war zone,&#x201d; says Shmyr. &#x201c;You �didn&#x2019;t take your helmet off going from your car to the rink for practice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t get mugged during that first year, they didn&#x2019;t think that much of you,&#x201d; says Gerry Cheevers, the Crusaders&#x2019; goalie.<br><br>Inside, it wasn&#x2019;t much better. Like a number of the old WHA rinks, the Cleveland Arena featured chicken wire instead of Plexiglas. As every WHA player knew, chicken wire had two distinct disadvantages: (1) You could pour beer through it, and (2) it produced some very strange bounces.<br><br>&#x201c;There were two standard lines when you were getting beer dumped on you,&#x201d; Shmyr says. &#x201c;The first one was, &#x2018;If you&#x2019;re going to pour beer on me at least hit me in the mouth.&#x2019; The second one was, &#x2018;Hey, that �isn&#x2019;t my brand.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>But the wire also gave the Crusaders a clear home�ice advantage. Neale says when you played there only a couple of times a year, fundamentals such as dump-ins and hard�arounds became a complete mystery to the visiting team. The savvy Cheevers, meanwhile, became a master at reading dump�ins off the mesh.<br><br>&#x201c;It was like watching Yastrzemski play the Green Monster at Fenway,&#x201d; Garrett says of Cheevers.<br><br>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t much to it,&#x201d; Cheevers shrugs. &#x201c;When the puck hit the screen, it would just drop.&#x201d;<br><br>At the other end of the ice, the Crusaders&#x2019; Gary Jarrett was equally adept at reading the caroms and ricochets in the offen�sive zone. Jarrett recorded 40 goals and 79 points in the Crusaders&#x2019; first year and 31 goals and 70 points in Year 2. However, when the Crusaders moved to their splendid new home in Richfield, and away from the chicken wire, Jarrett&#x2019;s totals fell to 41, then 33 points, and he retired after Year 4.<br><br>Jarrett, mind you, was probably the only player sad to see the Crusaders move in Year 3 into their new $20-million palace in the Cleveland suburbs. Widely described as the finest indoor facility in North America, the Coliseum had a seating capacity of just under twenty thousand, private boxes, a Jumbotron, and a fancy-schmancy restaurant long before those amenities were the industry norms.<br><br>&#x201c;It was the nicest rink by far in all of hockey, and it compares to anything they&#x2019;ve built today,&#x201d; says Shmyr.<br><br>There were, however, a few problems. The roads into the Coliseum, for starters, were unable to handle the traffic it created. Opening night featured a Frank Sinatra concert and a massive traffic jam in which ticket holders, dressed in tuxes and formal gowns, simply abandoned their cars on the highway miles away and hiked to the Coliseum in their evening wear.</p><h2>Buddy Unchained (Sit!

Producing nearly two-thirds of all the munitions used by Allied forces, American industry became what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called "the arsenal of democracy." Crucial in this effort were business leaders. Some of these captains of industry went to Washington to coordinate the mobilization, while others led their companies to churn out weapons. In this way, the private sector won the war&#x2014;or so the story goes.</p><p>Based on new research in business and military archives, <i>Destructive Creation</i> shows that the enormous mobilization effort relied not only on the capacities of private companies but also on massive public investment and robust government regulation. This public-private partnership involved plenty of government-business cooperation, but it also generated antagonism in the American business community that had lasting repercussions for American politics. Many business leaders, still engaged in political battles against the New Deal, regarded the wartime government as an overreaching regulator and a threatening rival. In response, they mounted an aggressive campaign that touted the achievements of for-profit firms while dismissing the value of public-sector contributions. This probusiness story about mobilization was a political success, not just during the war, but afterward, as it shaped reconversion policy and the transformation of the American military-industrial complex.</p><p>Offering a groundbreaking account of the inner workings of the "arsenal of democracy," <i>Destructive Creation</i> also suggests how the struggle to define its heroes and villains has continued to shape economic and political development to the present day.</p></p><p>Mark R. Wilson is Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He is author of The Business of Civil War: Military Mobilization and the State, 1861-1865.<p>Introduction</p><p>World War II was won not just by brave soldiers and sailors but also by mountains of mat�riel. This was true even in times and places where guts were at a premium, as during the Allied invasion of Normandy, in June 1944. On D-Day and in the days that followed, American GIs and their British and Canadian counterparts were sometimes disappointed (and killed) by their own machines, too many of which sank below the waves, missed their targets, or otherwise failed to work as advertised. Even so, the soldiers preparing to land on the Normandy beaches could not help but be overawed&#x2014;and deafened&#x2014;by the firepower assembled to support them. In the skies just ahead, they saw hundreds of military aircraft, which, on the morning of 6 June alone, dropped thousands of high-explosive bombs. Behind them in the English Channel floated more than a hundred hulking warships, their big guns close to overheating from their constant shelling of German positions on the shore. Along with the naval vessels, the soldiers could also see a fleet of hundreds of cargo ships and landing craft, stretching to the horizon. These vessels, by the end of the two weeks starting with D-Day, would deliver to the Normandy beaches nearly 94,000 vehicles and over 245,000 tons of equipment and supplies, along with nearly 620,000 men. Here was the beginning of the end for the German armies, which, in the weeks to come, would be overwhelmed by the speed and power of Allied forces.</p><p>D-Day was truly an Allied operation, in which Britain (and Canada) provided much of the equipment and manpower. Yet even in a battle that took place just a hundred miles from England, one of the world's great industrial nations, it was obvious how much the Allied war effort depended on the economic output of the United States. The skies above Normandy buzzed with the bombers of the Eighth Air Force and Ninth Air Force: B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators, and B-26 Marauders (among other aircraft), made in Seattle, San Diego, and Baltimore. Many of the GIs who struggled ashore at Omaha Beach owed their lives to the sailors manning the five-inch guns of a whole group of the U.S. Navy's <i>Gleaves</i>-class destroyers, sitting in shallow waters just behind them. Those destroyers had been built during the early months of the war, in places such as Norfolk, Newark, and Seattle. At Omaha Beach and elsewhere, soldiers went ashore in small landing craft, built largely in New Orleans. Once they landed, the Allied armies relied on thousands of Sherman tanks, two-and-a-half-ton trucks, and jeeps, most of which were made in Toledo and Detroit. These tanks and trucks were disgorged by the score at Normandy by a fleet of some 230 tank landing ships (LSTs), the biggest of the Allied landing vessels, most of which were constructed in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and southern Indiana. And most of the fuel for the Army vehicles, along with most of the high-octane gasoline guzzled by Allied aircraft, came from the United States, as did most of the aluminum and steel used to make the planes, ships, tanks, and trucks.</p><p>Normandy was an exceptional military operation, but its reliance on American-made machines and mat�riel was part of a broader pattern of Allied war-fighting. During World War II, the United States helped vanquish the Axis powers by converting its enormous economic capacities into military power. By producing nearly two-thirds of all the munitions used by Allied forces&#x2014;including huge numbers of aircraft, ships, tanks, trucks, rifles, artillery shells, and bombs&#x2014;American industry became what President Franklin D. Roosevelt once called "the arsenal of democracy," providing the foundations for a decisive victory.</p><p>So the U.S. military-industrial mobilization for World War II worked well, or at least well enough. But how exactly did it work? How were all those bombers, ships, and planes produced, in such short order, under the pressures of a war emergency? And how was the mobilization related to broader, longer-run political and economic developments? What lessons should we take from its history? Seven decades after the end of World War II, we still lack good answers to these questions.</p><p>Since the 1940s, most accounts of the U.S. industrial mobilization for World War II have emphasized one of two stories. The first is a tale of the patriotic contributions of American business leaders and their companies. This account of the war contains a large element of truth. Private companies&#x2014;including those led by remarkable wartime entrepreneurs such as the shipbuilder Henry Kaiser, as well as large manufacturing corporations like General Motors&#x2014;did indeed shoulder the burden of munitions production. Many business leaders threw themselves into the work, with impressive results.</p><p>The second account tells a far more critical story about American business leaders. Indeed, it claims that big industrial corporations exploited the war emergency, to regain political power and reap economic gains. This story emphasizes the activities of corporate executives who went to Washington to run the war economy, in special civilian mobilization agencies such as the Office of Production Management and its successor, the War Production Board. Using their new foothold, so the story goes, the big corporations allied themselves with a conservative military establishment to thwart smaller firms, New Dealers, consumers, workers, and other citizens. According to this account, big business enjoyed huge wartime profits, thanks to an abundance of no-risk, cost-plus military contracts, which evidently prefigured the Cold War-era "military-industrial complex."</p><p>Despite their differences, these two accounts share a tendency to ignore, or disdain, the role of the public sector, including the work of the men and women who staffed powerful military and civilian governmental agencies. In the stories that celebrate the wartime achievements of American capitalism, the main characters are for-profit firms and their executives, some of whom took temporary jobs in government to help win the war. These same executives also figure prominently, albeit as villains, in the anticorporate version of events. That story is ultimately no less disparaging of civilian governmental and military authorities, because most of those public officials are presented as the handmaidens of big business.</p><p>This book shows that the military-industrial juggernaut of the early 1940s relied heavily on public investment, public management of industrial supply chains, and robust regulation. These powerful state actions shaped the dynamics of political struggle on the World War II home front. Wartime government-business relations were often antagonistic. Many business leaders regarded the wartime state as an annoyance: an imposing, overreaching regulator, as well as a threatening rival. They said so, openly, throughout the war. Their protests included aggressive, coordinated public-relations efforts, which played up the achievements of the private sector while dismissing the value of public contributions to the war economy. This pro-business framing effort was never uncontested, but it proved remarkably successful during World War II&#x2014;and long after.</p><p>This book builds on a third, loosely woven and overlooked set of studies, which have called attention to the importance of public finance, military administration, and government enterprise on the American home front. Drawing on new research in a great deal of previously underused evidence, including the archival records of leading military contractors and U.S. military bureaus, this book calls our attention to important but poorly remembered actors. Like many previous studies, this one includes characters such as William Knudsen, Donald Nelson, Henry Kaiser, and the War Production Board. But it also describes the work of less familiar individuals and agencies, such as the Army Air Forces' Materiel Command (based at Wright Field, in Ohio); military "price adjustment" boards; and plant seizure teams, led by career military officers such as Admiral Harold G. Bowen. It also considers a variety of important war contractors, including midsize and larger companies in several industries, along with some of the era's most politically active business executives. Many of the latter, including Frederick C. Crawford and J. Howard Pew, joined the ranks of top military contractors in the early 1940s, despite their deep distrust of the federal government.</p><p>Following the activities of this diverse cast of characters, this book weaves together two stories about "destructive creation." During the early part of World War II, the economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the phrase "creative destruction" to refer to the dynamism of capitalist economies, in which entrepreneurs created economic growth, even as they caused painful disruptions. Schumpeter did not use the phrase to refer specifically to the U.S. war mobilization, about which he knew little. But he presented it at a moment in which the U.S. economy was being transformed into a generator of devastating military power. Here was what might be called a "destructive creation," in which a giant capitalist economy was harnessed for the purpose of annihilating its enemies.</p><p>Successful conversion of the U.S. economy into an agent of "destructive creation" owed as much to socialism as it did to capitalism. To be sure, the American war economy relied on private-sector capacities, allowed for profits, and involved some competition among private firms. But it was also a war economy full of state enterprise and ramped-up regulation. The government paid for, and owned, acres of new industrial plant; it managed complex supply chains. It collected huge amounts of information about its contractors' costs and business operations, which helped it to strictly control prices and profits. It even seized the facilities of several dozen companies, including those led by executives who flouted federal labor law.</p><p>Remembering this public management and regulation of the industrial mobilization for World War II illuminates the history of modern conservative politics. Contrary to common belief, the war did not suspend politics as usual. In fact, the business community continued the energetic public-relations effort begun in the 1930s to counter the New Deal. During World War II, business leaders expanded that antistatist political effort, adjusting it to take account of new circumstances. As more and more firms and executives experienced the heavy hand of wartime state regulation, the business community and its political allies gained solidarity and strength. Executives from "big business" and the leaders of midsize and smaller firms, across many industries, joined together to resist government encroachment during wartime and&#x2014;perhaps more important&#x2014;to create a postwar future in which state enterprise and regulation would play a smaller part. Business leaders' political energy and unity, far from weakened by the stresses of war or patriotic duty, seem to have been bolstered by their common encounter with a formidable wartime state. This hardly made them all-powerful in the political arena but did leave them well positioned, after 1945, to continue to reverse the setbacks that they had experienced in the 1930s.</p><p>During and after the war, the business community was remarkably successful in framing the lessons of the military-industrial mobilization. According to business leaders, only for-profit enterprises made positive contributions to the production "miracle" of the early 1940s. This story, which was substantially destructive of the truth, contributed to a longer-running strain of American political discourse, which has disparaged governmental actors, condemned labor unions, and celebrated private enterprise. The history of the political struggles of the World War II era suggests the inadequacy of depictions of a static mid-twentieth-century liberal "consensus" or New Deal "order." Conservative business leaders in the 1940s saw themselves as engaged in a long war against excessive government regulation. From their point of view, the battle to frame the political lessons of the nation's economic mobilization for the biggest war in history seemed like a significant one, even if it might not offer any sort of immediate, wholesale triumph in the larger war.</p><p>Transformations in the military-industrial sector shaped American political and economic development. Starting in the 1940s, the American military economy swung toward privatization. By the mid-1960s, much of the government-controlled weapons production and design capacity, which had existed in the United States since the early nineteenth century, had been shed. This was no small achievement for the champions of free enterprise&#x2014;especially during the early Cold War, when the military accounted for the majority of all national governmental expenditures. The oft-discussed rise of deregulation and privatization that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s was preceded, and then accompanied, by an equally significant shift in the military-industrial field.</p><p>By the end of the twentieth century, many American leaders had accepted conservative myths about wartime industrial mobilization. Their own defense policies relied heavily on free markets and private contractors, while neglecting targeted public investment, state enterprise, and regulation of prices and profits. This policy orientation, which extended well beyond the defense sector, evidently allowed for plenty of technological innovation and economic growth. However, it is far from clear whether it has provided the United States, or the world, with optimal or even adequate solutions to many of the more pressing problems of the day. In the future, as some of those problems develop into more acute crises, there may be more interest in reviewing what we have learned from the history of the American response to the challenge of World War II. Such an exercise in lessons-learned history, should it be undertaken, may be unsettling, for it will be hard not to conclude that today's domestic and global political economy has been shaped by a misreading of the past.</p></p><h2>Hindu Gods and Goddesses</h2><p>The many gods and goddesses of India need not be a mystery to those of us in the West.

There is scarcely a student of Christian worship who has not been stirred by the brilliant mind of the late Orthodox theologian Alexander Schmemann. He was deeply stimulated by modern movements and figures in Western Christian thought. He brings into the Western discussion of Christian unity, the relation of the Church to the world in revolution, the question of papal supremacy, and the effort to commend the gospel to a post-Christian world&#39;a worldview at once Orthodox, patristic, and realistic. His sacramental realism and wholeness is exciting and refreshing for those, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, who have been reared on scholastic categories. The present work was basic to much of Schmemann&#39;s academic research and creativity. In it, he defines liturgical theology, noting that the dynamic realism of the Eucharistic liturgy often has been obscured in popular liturgical piety. This theme is developed in reference to the shape of worship as it evolved in the Orthodox Church, from the earliest years to its crystallization in Byzantium from the ninth through the twelfth centuries.</p><p>Father Alexander Schmemann (+1983) was a prolific writer, brilliant lecturer, and dedicated pastor. Former dean and professor of liturgical theology at St Vladimir&#39;s Orthodox Theological Seminary, his insight into contemporary culture and liturgical celebration left an indelible mark on the Christian community worldwide.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Star Wars: The Force Awakens Incredible Cross-Sections</h2><p><p>See the vehicles of <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens&#x2122;</i> in unparalleled detail with this newest addition to the <i>Star Wars</i> Incredible Cross Sections series.

A mother of two, a Christian, and a lifelong resident of middle America, Lenz was bewildered by the pain and loss around her&#x2015;the empty churches and the broken hearts. What was happening to faith in the heartland?</p><br><p>From drugstores in Sydney, Iowa, to skeet shooting in rural Illinois, to the mega churches of Minneapolis, Lenz set out to discover the changing forces of faith and tradition in God's country. Part journalism, part memoir, <i>God Land</i> is a journey into the heart of a deeply divided America. Lenz visits places of worship across the heartland and speaks to the everyday people who often struggle to keep their churches afloat and to cope in a land of instability. Through a thoughtful interrogation of the effects of faith and religion on our lives, our relationships, and our country, <i>God Land</i> investigates whether our divides can ever be bridged and if America can ever come together. </p></p><p><p>Lyz Lenz has been published in the <em>New York Times, </em>Buzzfeed,<em> Washington Post, The Guardian, </em>ESPN, Marie Claire, Mashable, Salon, and more. Her book <i>Belabored: Tales of Myth, Medicine, and Motherhood</i> is forthcoming. She also has an essay in the anthology <i>Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture</i> edited by Roxane Gay. Lenz holds an MFA in creative writing from Lesley University and is a contributing writer to the <em>Columbia Journalism Review.</em></p><p><em>God Land</em> is a stubbornly hopeful book about how the places of faith we belong to might someday belong to us.</p> (Kate Bowler, podcast host and author of <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Everything Happens for a Reason (and other lies I&#x2019;ve loved)</i>)<br><br><em>God Land</em>&nbsp;is a remarkable work of reporting, memoir, and cultural criticism&#x2015;a blazingly intelligent book exploring the ways that faith can both create and scatter communities in America. Lenz's beautiful prose&#x2015;by turns brutal, lyrical, Biblical, and richly comic&#x2015;propels the reader along with her on this journey through the churches and faith communities of the Midwest. Amid a trend of books over the past several years that purport to explain the heartland in easy terms, Lenz offers us something far more valuable: a frank and perceptive analysis of what is broken, and will remain broken, among communities of faith in the Midwest and across the country. Easy answers come and go, but our brokenness is here to stay, and Lenz helps us see the hidden jointures while also helping us to see the grace in our brokenness, and to wonder whether it is not also our common bond. (Ted Scheinman, author of&nbsp;<i>Camp Austen</i>)<br><br>Lyz Lenz's <em>God Land</em> is deeply critical and probing, but also generous and uncynical. Lenz writes with fury and tenderness, pursuing uncomfortable questions of faith, community, and self with unyielding tenacity. She writes as beautifully about ugliness and frustration as she does about love and grace. And the conclusions she reaches about herself, her religion, and her country are bracing in their thoughtful honesty. (Josh Gondelman, coauthor (with Joe Berkowitz) of <i>You Blew It</i>)<br><br>Lyz Lenz writes the story of so many of us&#x2015;those who have been betrayed by American Christianity and yet are being reborn in the ashes of a new kind of faith. For those seeking to understand the divides of religion&#x2015;including urban/rural, racial, and liberal/progressive&#x2015;<em>God Land</em> serves as an intimate chance to listen to an insider account of why people are leaving the faith (and why some remain). Lenz is a funny, irreverent, and keen-eyed writer, who succeeds in converting us to both love and mourn the place of our country known as Middle America. (D. L. Mayfield, activist and author of <i>Assimilate or Go Home: Notes from a Failed Missionary on Rediscovering Faith</i>)<br><br><p><em>God Land </em>is a gorgeous meditation and clear-eyed examination of Christianity in the heartland. Weaving original reporting and memoir, Lyz Lenz dispels stubborn mythologies and beautifully captures the heartbreak, hope, nuance and diversity of the Midwestern faithful. I love this book and highly recommend it.</p> (Deborah Jian Lee, author of <i>Rescuing Jesus: How People of Color, Women and Queer Christians are Reclaiming Evangelicalism</i>)<br><br><i><br></i><p><i>God Land</i>, Lyz Lenz's much-anticipated debut book, is a marvel. Not only is it a window into the middle America so many like to stereotype but fail to fully understand in all of its complexity, but it mixes reportage, memoir, and gorgeous prose so seamlessly I wanted to know how she did it. After laying bare all manner of losses of faith, both&nbsp;personal and community, Lenz journeys to a sense of hope, rooted in generosity, that is fully earned. <i>God Land</i> will expand your horizons on what this country offers and who inhabits it, and why we're better off journeying together, rather than apart.</p> (Sarah Weinman, author of <i>The Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel That Scandalized the World</i>)<br><br><p><em>God Land</em>&nbsp;gives testimony&nbsp;to&nbsp;human resiliency amid personal and collective trauma. With keen journalistic insights and vulnerable storytelling, Lyz Lenz provides a clear-eyed account of loss and alienation within communities throughout middle America, but she also honors her and others' remarkable ability to pick up the pieces and to keep going when all seems lost.</p> (Katelyn Beaty, author of&nbsp;<i>A Woman's Place</i>)</p><h2>Studies in Hysteria (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Hysteria&#x2014;the tormenting of the body by the troubled mind&#x2014;is among the most pervasive of human disorders; yet, at the same time, it is the most elusive.

In 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died the following year.&nbsp;Freud's career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation: psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half-century.<br><br><b>Nicola Luckhurst</b> is a lecturer in literature at Goldsmith&#x2019;s College, University of London.</p><h2>The Power of Awareness</h2><p>Neville Lancelot Goddard was born in Barbados in 1905. He came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen and whilst touring with his dance company in England he developed an interest in metaphysics after striking up a conversation with a Scotsman. The Scotsman lent him a series of books on the powers of the mind. On his return he gave up the entertainment industry to devote his full attention to the study of spiritual and mystical matters. After traveling extensively throughout the United States, Neville eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the 1950s, he gave a series of talks on television and radio, and for many years lectured regularly to capacity audiences. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he confined most of his lectures to Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. In his early lectures and books, Neville dealt solely with what he called The Law, the technique of creating one&#39;s physical reality through imagining. It is this portion of his expression that most closely accords with the teachings of the New Thought movement. In 1959 he began to experience what he called The Promise. In the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s Neville gave more emphasis to The Promise than to The Law. One could use imaginal power to change one&#39;s circumstances, he said, but it would be temporary, &#34;...and will vanish like smoke.&#34; He went on to explain that The Promise superseded The Law, claiming &#34;Oh, you can use it [The Law] to make a fortune, to become known in the world, all these things are done, but, your true purpose here is to fulfill Scripture.&#34; After subordinating The Law to The Promise, he became as eager to hear accounts by those who had experienced The Promise, and sharing such accounts, as he had earlier of those with The Law. The Power of Awareness attempts to demonstrate how to use our mind to realize our wishes. As such, it is an important part of the larger New Thought Movement, in which Neville holds a prominent place. Reprint of 1952 first edition.</p><p>Neville Goddard is well known as one of the most influential teachers and writers of metaphysical work. Neville was born on 19 February 1905 in Barbados. He was the fourth child in a family of nine boys and one girl. In 1922, Neville came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen. During his entertaining tour in England as a vaudeville dancer and stage actor, he developed a great interest in metaphysics. Hence, he gave up his entertainment job and devote fully to the study of metaphysics and spiritual matters.

Their journey takes them to Egypt, where they study the various conditions of men's lives, before returning home in a "conclusion in which nothing is concluded." Johnson's tale is not only a satire on optimism, but also an expression of truth about the human mind and its infinite capacity for hope.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>In Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s classic philosophical tale, the prince and princess of Abissinia escape their confinement in the Happy Valley and conduct an ultimately unsuccessful search for a choice of life that leads to happiness. Johnson uses the conventions of the Oriental tale to depict a universal restlessness of desire. The excesses of Orientalism&#x2014;its superfluous splendours, its despotic tyrannies, its riotous pleasures&#x2014;cannot satisfy us. His tale challenges us by showing the problem of finding happiness to be insoluble while still dignifying our quest for fulfillment. The appendices to this Broadview edition include reviews and biographies, selections from the sequel Dinarbas (1790), and the complete text of Elizabeth Pope Whately's The Second Part of the History of Rasselas (1835). Selections from Johnson&#x2019;s translation of the travel narrative A Voyage to Abyssinia, as well as his Oriental tales in the Rambler, are also included, along with another popular tale, Joseph Addison&#x2019;s "The Vision of Mirzah," and selections from Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&#x2019;s Turkish Embassy Letters.<b>Samuel Johnson</b> (1709-1784) was the leading literary scholar and critic of his time.

We live in a world of vivid colors, and color marks our psychological and social existence. But for all color&#x2019;s inescapability, we don&#x2019;t know much about it. Now authors David Scott Kastan and Stephen Farthing offer a fresh and imaginative exploration of one of the most intriguing and least understood aspects of everyday experience.<br><br> Kastan and Farthing, a scholar and a painter, respectively, investigate color from numerous perspectives: literary, historical, cultural, anthropological, philosophical, art historical, political, and scientific. In ten lively and wide-ranging chapters, each devoted to a different color, they examine the various ways colors have shaped and continue to shape our social and moral imaginations. Each individual color becomes the focal point for a consideration of one of the extraordinary ways in which color appears and matters in our lives. Beautifully produced in full color, this book is a remarkably smart, entertaining, and fascinating guide to this elusive topic.</p><p><b>David Scott Kastan</b>, the George M.

He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this 'March Up-Country' (<i>Anabasis</i>); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth.</p><p>Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> is a true story of remarkable adventures. <i>Hellenica,</i> a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In <i>Memorabilia</i> Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The <i>Apology</i> is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i> portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and <i>Oeconomicus</i> has him giving advice on household management and married life. <i>Cyropaedia,</i> a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes.</p><p>We also have his <i>Hiero,</i> a dialogue on government; <i>Agesilaus,</i> in praise of that king; <i>Constitution of Lacedaemon</i> (on the Spartan system); <i>Ways and Means</i> (on the finances of Athens); <i>Manual for a Cavalry Commander;</i> a good manual of <i>Horsemanship;</i> and a lively <i>Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians,</i> though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.</p></p><p><p>Samuel Walter Miller (1864&#x2013;1949) taught classics and archaeology at Missouri, Stanford, and Tulane, and as a member of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens led the first American excavation in Greece.</p></p><h2>Understanding Spiritual Gifts: A Verse-by-Verse Study of 1 Corinthians 12-14</h2><p>(Revised edition) This thorough study of spiritual gifts will help Christians understand their God-given gifts and how they should use those gifts in the church.</p><p>Robert L.

Eleven o&#x2019;clock on a balmy June evening and the Shilin Night Market in Taipei was spilling over with mei shoppers looking for a way to cool themselves. Stores lined both sides of the narrow street, and music blared in Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English. The road was closed to traffic, overtaken by vendors with carts selling noodles and oyster omelets, cold juices and shakes. Others spread their merchandise on the ground over blankets, hawking cheap toys and knickknacks.<br> <br>I slouched lower on the plastic table, faded black boots planted on a stool beneath, taking in the stench of cigarette smoke, stale beer, and sweat. I flipped my butterfly knife rhythmically between my fingers, enjoying the feel of cold steel and the sound of blade and handles snapping in my hand.<br> <br>Men glanced at me warily, touching the places where they hid their own weapons. Girls clustered closer as they edged past, chattering. One mei girl, barely fifteen, raised her kohl-smudged eyes from her heap of chua bing smothered in red beans and smiled at me, electric blue bangs brushing against her lashes. Most teens were maskless tonight, wanting to have fun and pretend that they led lives from some other era, when going barefaced was normal. Pretend that they breathed good air.<br> <br>The mei girl&#x2019;s friend elbowed her and loudly uttered something about delinquent mei boys hiding their faces behind face masks. She cast a pointed glare in my direction. They sashayed past, legs bare beneath short, ruffled skirts, the friend with her nose in the air. Smiling girl&#x2019;s pink mouth was now pursed in a pout.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I called.<br> <br>She half turned, careful not to spill her iced dessert. Her black brows were raised, widening her dark eyes. I winked at her, spinning my knife, then tossed it in the air before catching it in one swift motion. She blushed, and her giggle carried to me even as her friend tugged her away, disappearing into the throngs.<br> <br>But I never lost sight of the two you girls bent over a round tub, trying to toss plastic balls into floating dishes. The prize was a koi&#x2014;genetically engineered to never grow beyond two inches&#x2014;in iridescent oranges, reds, and greens. Hell, they probably glowed in the dark. The girls were flanked by three bodyguards, beefy mei boys with muscular arms crossed against their bulging chests.<br> <br>I had volunteered to do this, because if I were caught, I alone would be prosecuted. I would be the only one to be put to death. My friends would be safe. They all had family, or someone who loved them. I was the dispensable one, and I would give my life to protect them.<br> <br>A you boy strutted toward the girls, his features obscured by his glass helmet from this distance. We called them &#x201c;bowl heads&#x201d; in derision, as their helmets looked like fishbowls. His sleek suit was black, with an indigo dragon breathing orange flames woven down one long sleeve. The suit ensured that he got the best oxygen available, that his temperature was regulated, that he was always plugged in to the you communication system. The taller girl in the white-and-silver suit ignored him, intent on winning a koi in a jar, but her petite friend nodded to the bodyguards, and the you boy swaggered through.<br> <br>I snorted under my breath.<br> <br>They chatted, probably pulling up info on their com sys, assessing weight, height, and genetic makeup even as they exchanged first names. This was what it meant to be you, to have. To be genetically cultivated as a perfect human specimen before birth&#x2014;vaccinated and fortified, calibrated and optimized. To have an endless database of information instantly retrievable within a second of thinking the query and displayed in helmet. To have the best air, food, and water, ensuring the longest possible life spans as the world went to rot around them.<br> <br>Me, I&#x2019;m like the other 95 percent of the meis in this country&#x2014;without. We want and are left wanting. I&#x2019;d be lucky if I lived to forty. I&#x2019;m almost halfway there.<br> <br>The you boy fiddled with his collar, then took his helmet off, handing it to one of the bodyguards with studied nonchalance. He coughed for a long time into his sleeve, attempting to adjust to the filth we breathed every day. What a rebel. Without his helmet, I got a better look at him. His blond hair was chin-length, streaked in red, his features Asian. He looked about seventeen.<br> <br>He pulled a cigarette from a sleeve pocket and lit it, inhaling deeply, tilting his head to blow the smoke out. He leaned toward the petite you girl, his expression flirtatious. I watched as the taller girl threw them a glance, then turned back toward the tub. She was broad-shouldered yet slender, her suit decorated in neon pink lines with a jeweled Hello Kitty sewn above her heart. Real gemstones, no doubt. The way she tensed her shoulders told me she wasn&#x2019;t pleased by the you boy&#x2019;s intrusion.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been studying the suits for my task. Victor had gotten his hands on all the relevant info. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want the more square helmets,&#x201d; he had said, showing me images on the screen. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s an older model from two years ago. Any embellishment like jewels would be real. Nothing but the best for Jin&#x2019;s suits. So the shinier the suit, the richer the you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Although the shorter girl&#x2019;s purple suit was more eye-catching, the taller girl had probably $100K worth of diamonds stitched to her chest.<br> <br>I tucked the knife away and retrieved two small items from a pouch strapped to my side. I wore a sleeveless black tee and black jeans to match. Not only did I blend in, but it allowed me to move with ease. I jumped off the table and stretched my arms overhead, flexing my shoulders.<br> <br>Now or never.<br> <br>I cut a quick path through the crowds, moving diagonally, thumping into others as they scurried out of my way. Steam rose from the pot of the chou doufu vendor stirring her spicy broth, and my eyes watered from the scent. I was behind the bodyguards within a minute. Their massive backs blocked me from my target. I tapped the middle one on his shoulder. He twisted, fists clenched.<br> <br>&#x201c;Move,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>I cocked my elbow and punched him hard in the nose, breaking it. The oaf roared, covering his face as blood spurted. I barreled past him and slammed into the you boy, who was gaping, bug-eyed. The other two bodyguards swiped at me with clumsy hands. I leaped out of the way, but not before one of them managed to grab my mask, pulling it off so it hung at my neck.<br> <br>No matter. Grinning at him, I smashed the vial I held to the ground. Noxious smoke billowed around us. The bodyguards and boy dropped like sacks of rice within five seconds. Bet that you boy would regret taking off his helmet tomorrow morning. The petite girl screamed shrilly beside me as passersby shouted, but everyone steered clear of the fumes.<br> <br>I lunged for the tall girl, pulling her tight to my chest, and plunged the syringe into her hand, the only exposed part of her body. The needle hissed as it dispensed the sleep-spell drug. She sank against me and I hefted her over my shoulder, dashing into the dark alley behind us, finally allowing myself to take a breath when I cleared the smoke. She wasn&#x2019;t heavy, but all cumbersome limbs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eh, you!&#x201d; a man shouted, his running footsteps echoing behind me.<br> <br>I cursed and spun around the corner into a black alley. My pursuer followed immediately. I stuck out my foot, and he tripped over it, thumping hard onto the uneven pavement.<br> <br>I ran without looking back, gripping the girl tightly by her legs, the streets&#x2019; layout etched in my mind. The distant din of the night market reached me, accompanied by the shriek of police sirens as they inched their way through the crowds. No one followed. I burst onto the main street at the far end of the market, hailing a taxi. It screeched to a stop, spewing foul exhaust. I slipped my mask back on before yanking open the door. &#x201c;Take me to the end of the bus line,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>The driver nodded, raising an eyebrow as I gently lay my hostage on the backseat. &#x201c;She drank too much,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;I tried to warn her.&#x201d;<br> <br>He flicked a cigarette butt out the window before merging back into traffic. &#x201c;Those you girls have everything, but they always want more.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stared out the open window as the driver zipped through the streets with expertise, honking at pedestrians and mopeds alike. &#x201c;You her bodyguard?&#x201d; he asked, catching my eye in the rearview mirror.<br> <br>I shook my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, her boy toy, then.&#x201d; He grinned. &#x201c;Whatever pays the bills, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Right. My friends and I had decided the best way to gain info on Jin Corp was to get suited, infiltrating the yous by becoming one of them. Victor was perfect for the task&#x2014;with his charm and good looks, he&#x2019;d fit right in. But we needed funding. And who better to fund us than those who had a few hundred million to spare?<br> <br>Neon signs flickered in a kaleidoscope of colors, washing my vision in reds and blues, oranges and greens. I kept a hand on the you girl&#x2019;s arm, so she wouldn&#x2019;t tumble over with the taxi driver&#x2019;s sudden braking. Her glass helmet reflected the lights around us, and I couldn&#x2019;t make out her features. I swallowed, suddenly afraid. There was no going back now. I jerked my face away, loosening my grip when I realized I was squeezing her arm.<br> <br>She was unresponsive, her chest barely rising with each breath. She&#x2019;d be out until tomorrow morning at least.<br> <br>The taxi slammed to a stop, and I threw my arms around the girl to keep her from falling onto the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here we are, end of the line,&#x201d; the driver said.<br> <br>I handed him the cashcard tied to a fake identity and bank account Lingyi had set up. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Add five for tip.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled, the corners of his eyes creasing with deep lines, and saluted me. He couldn&#x2019;t have been more than twenty-five.<br> <br>I got out and lifted the girl from the seat, kicking the door shut with my foot. The driver blared his horn twice before tearing off. It was almost midnight, and I needed to be within Yangmingshan as soon as possible. The end of the bus line was near the mountain&#x2019;s base. I shifted the girl so her head rested against my shoulder, her helmet smooth and cold against my cheek, and started my long climb home.<br> <br>The half-moon was wan, obscured by clouds and pollution. The Vox on my wrist provided scant light, but I navigated the muddied roads without trouble, stopping twice to catch my breath. Each time I laid my captive down, setting her head on my thigh, not knowing how else to place her. She seemed inhuman encased in her glass helmet. Alien. The neon pink lines of her suit glowed in the dark, and her exposed, soft hands lay limp at her sides.<br> <br>How had we drifted so far from what it meant to be human? I could remove her helmet, but it seemed too much of a violation. I smiled sardonically at the irony.<br> <br>I rose, throwing the girl over my shoulder. She no longer felt light&#x2014;it was like hauling an elephant, and my arms were dead weights. Finally, I spotted the outcropping of jagged stones marking where I should turn off the path. Darkness enveloped me as I picked my way between thick brush and massive trees. Three years ago, mudslides after a bad typhoon season were followed immediately by a massive earthquake that swallowed teahouses, roads, and homes alike. Half of Yangmingshan went up in flames. Survivors fled, and due to the economic depression and rumors of the mountain being cursed, no investors ever bothered to rebuild.<br> <br>Now the once-scenic getaway was deserted, lush, and wild, its only occupants the dead in overturned graves. And me. If anyone else lived on Yangmingshan, our paths never crossed.<br> <br>I counted my steps, legs trembling with the effort. Near my four hundredth, I spotted the first garden light, glowing like a flower spirit. I had planted them for the last fifty steps leading home. Each light was solar-powered. Sweat stung my eyes, but I was too close to stop. The heavy wooden door to the laboratory clicked open by my voice command, and I stumbled inside, laying the girl on the cot in the small office that served as my bedroom.<br> <br>I slumped to the floor, arms draped over raised knees, and sat there until I caught my breath.<br> <br>Leaving her, I stripped and washed myself in the makeshift shower, wishing I had cold water instead of the lukewarm spray that pattered over me. Every muscle shook as I soaped myself, before drying off and pulling on some shorts. The front door could be activated by my voice alone, but I took no chances and rummaged through the green metal desk, finding the key that I needed. I locked us in, then slipped the key on a string and tied it around my neck.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t even look in on the you girl again before crashing onto the worn sofa in the main room, falling immediately into an exhausted sleep.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Something prickled my consciousness awake; it wasn&#x2019;t the brightness of day. My eyes snapped open to find the you girl peering at me, her bowl head not an inch away from my nose. I glimpsed her face for the first time. She&#x2019;d had little work done that I could see: eyes halfway between almond-shaped and slender, a rounded nose, and a full mouth. Her eyes were a light brown, like the watered-down coffee I&#x2019;d buy with fake cream. Her fingers were extended tentatively above my throat. The back of her hand was bruised where I had jabbed her with the needle. She jumped back when she saw that I had woken. I looked down and remembered the key, then cursed myself for not putting on any clothes the previous night.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was only a precaution,&#x201d; I said, my voice cracking. I cleared my throat and sat up. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to get out even if you&#x2019;d gotten it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stood over me, appearing even leaner in the daylight, all long lines and sharp angles.<br> <br>&#x201c;The back door&#x2019;s blocked,&#x201d; she said in perfect, educated Mandarin.<br> <br>Her voice surprised me. Rich, like dark chocolate&#x2014;more womanly than she looked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mudslide,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>She nodded and drew her other hand from behind her back, revealing a pair of dull scissors I kept in the desk. &#x201c;I could have killed you in your sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You would have had to try hard.&#x201d; I rose, reaching for a clean shirt draped over the back of a wooden chair. It was black, like most of my clothes. &#x201c;Those scissors are from another century.&#x201d; I pulled on the shirt, then some blue jeans, and scrubbed a hand through my dyed blond hair, suddenly self-conscious. I had taken off my mask the night before, assuming I would wake up before she did. Now it was pointless, but seeing each other face-to-face like this felt odd. We&#x2019;d become a society that barely showed our faces to strangers anymore.<br> <br>Now what?<br> <br>We stared at each other for a long moment. If she were a feline, her tail would be thrashing.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much do you want?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>I reached for the scissors, and she let go without protest but said, &#x201c;They were still sharp enough to stab you in the throat.&#x201d;<br> <br>I paused, surprised by her boldness. Maybe if I hadn&#x2019;t woken when I did, I&#x2019;d be bleeding out on the sofa right now. Game over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you hungry?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Her eyes narrowed, and she shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you must be thirsty. The sleep spell will do that to you.&#x201d; I crossed the spare chamber to the corner kitchen and pulled the refrigerator door open, grabbing a bottle of fancy you water, purified and enriched with gods knew what.

Assignments had been increasing. The future-project outlook was rosy. Everything had changed. At least, that's what she thought. &nbsp; <br><br>"A giddy, mind-numbing joy overtook me when I decided to work on my own. The sense of independence, the excitement, the seemingly unlimited potential! The only thing that could stop me was, well, me. I had just gotten a very small advance for a book. By the way I reacted, you'd have thought I'd been named Bill Gates's sole heir. Visions of the lifestyle I dreamed of beckoned me like a siren song. I did what any shortsighted, overcaffeinated twentysomething would do: I quit my job. Doing this took some guts but also an incredible amount of stupidity. &nbsp; <br><br>"At first it was heaven. I stayed warm at home while my roommate headed out into the rain for the morning commute. I didn't have to put on work clothes. I made my own schedule. And more than anything, I was actually being paid&#x2014;though not too much&#x2014;to work on a book. I was certain I could line up some more work when I needed to. I thought things would take care of themselves. So I plodded along, made my deadlines. My friends were congratulatory and supportive, and life was good. &nbsp; <br><br>"Until it wasn't. &nbsp; <br><br>"I did line up those freelance articles, but for some crazy reason the editing schedule at the magazines was not designed to coincide with the dates my bills were due. Go figure. And when it was time for me to start paying for my own health benefits (since I'd said good-bye to those once I quit my job)...ouch. I looked and looked for decent coverage at a reasonable price. Even the cost of catastrophic health insurance&#x2014;the 'If your appendix bursts, we'll take it out' plan&#x2014;was way outside my budget. So I did what a lot of people in that situation would do: I went without. &nbsp; <br>"Bad went to worse. This check came late, that assignment didn't come through, and soon I was borrowing money. The evil debt monster was creeping up behind me. I was getting work, but the flow of money from day to day was not supporting me in a manner that allowed for even a modest measure of sanity. &nbsp; <br><br>"In short, I wasn't prepared. My lack of preparation caused me to risk not only my financial health but also the career I so desperately wanted. Those enticing visions of an idealized lifestyle that had caused me to go down this path were gone. I had to figure out a way to get them back. But I had to do it right." &nbsp; <br><br>THE MYTHOS OF THE INDEPENDENT WORKFORCE &nbsp; <br>Denise let her dream distract her from her financial reality. Are we saying that dreams can't be achieved? Absolutely not. Quite the opposite. What we are saying is that dreams (and if "dreams" sounds too touchy-feely for you, feel free to substitute "goals," "plans," "ideals"...) can only be achieved if they grow out of your reality. In other words, you need to build a bridge from where you are to that dream place where you want to be. Denise ignored the realities of her present situation (limited funding, no financial cushion, no real plan), and it wreaked havoc with the ideals she had in mind for herself (working from home, earning a living from her writing, being financially solvent). Rather than working toward a concrete dream, her poor planning was making her the main character in an oft-perpetuated and usually self-fulfilling myth: that freelancers must all suffer financially. &nbsp; <br><br>Ever since Zeus launched his first thunderbolt and Icarus got that nasty sunburn, myths, stereotypes, labels, pigeonholes&#x2014;whatever you choose to call them&#x2014;have been created and perpetuated to communicate stories about groups and cultures. Unfortunately, many of the prevailing ideas about freelancers and independent workers are negative. And the myths are so powerful that we can end up believing them ourselves, whether we realize it or not. &nbsp; <br><br>"Freelance" is not a word that usually conjures up images of hard work, security, and financial success. People in the arts get a particularly bad rap. "The struggling artist"... it's almost as though being prosperous conflicts with the very idea of pursuing what you most dearly desire to do. In fact, the freelance life is often viewed by those in the nine-to-five world as&#x2014;let's be honest&#x2014;kinda slack and self-indulgent. Any independent worker knows that this is far from true. But this doesn't stop friends in offices from calling in the middle of the day to ask, innocently, "What are you doing?" &nbsp; <br><br>Who, me? Oh, I'm just lying here, stretched out on the old sofa, one finger up my nose, the other hand in a bag of chips, watching a couple of aesthetically challenged midlifers redoing their home and arguing over what a Tuscan kitchen is.... &nbsp; <br><br>What do you think we're doing? We're working, you nit! &nbsp; <br><br>And then there are independent workers who, though they may labor away in offices, are struggling to create a secure financial lifestyle in a larger society that often believes that the only key to security and prosperity is a traditional job. &nbsp; <br><br>For a growing number of us, that's either not what we want or simply not an option. &nbsp; <br><br>Remember: how the outside world sees you and how you see yourself are two different things. Give in to the "creative people aren't good with money" mind-set, and guess what? You can kiss your sweet financial patootie and any chance of a comfy retirement good-bye. Accept the idea that the self-employed are destined to work like rat dogs with no financial security until their stubby little fingers can't qwerty anymore, and you can go ahead and start collecting cats now. &nbsp; <br><br>Contrary to popular belief, anyone who is supporting herself as a freelance or self-employed anything is working. A lot. Not only that, but independent workers must toil harder than salaried employees at managing their money, because no one else is doing it for them. While it's frustrating to be misunderstood by those who think you're leading a bonbons-for-breakfast kind of life, what's more important-especially to your money-management health-is how you view yourself. It's time for you to see yourself succeeding and achieving; otherwise, the money that comes into your life will slip away. &nbsp; <br><br>WE THE PEOPLE...A MANIFESTO FOR THE REST OF US<br>As you move through your day, take stock of the different people you encounter: secretaries, construction workers, waitstaff, realtors, landscapers...and remind yourself that they, too, may be working from client to client. They, too, are wondering how to deal with the rising cost of health care. They, too, are struggling to save for retirement without the benefit of a 401(k). Look at them, and feel the solidarity rising up within you. &nbsp; <br><br>Look at them and know: you are not alone. &nbsp; <br><br>Make no mistake: the independent worker is the future of the American workforce. Our numbers are growing, and in tough economic times, they increase a lot-and do so very quickly. &nbsp; <br><br>Some people choose to be out on their own. But lots of folks reading this book don't want to be in a work situation where there is no health care, no retirement, no paid vacation. But hey-they are anyway. Nearly 2.6 million people lost their jobs in 2008 alone, and the nation racked up another 3.4 million job losses between January and October of 2009. Many of those workers will never reenter the traditional workforce, instead joining the ranks of independent workers. A design firm lays off employees, and suddenly those ex-staff are competing with you for freelance assignments. A plant closes, and suddenly folks show up asking for shifts at your restaurant. A housing crisis hits, and there are just as many carpenters but a pitiful amount of new construction. What then? &nbsp; <br><br>Having your financial house in order brings peace of mind. It also puts you in a better position to survive and thrive, no matter what the economic climate. &nbsp; <br><br>After all, anyone who knows how to run a business, generate income, manage money, interact with customers and clients-all on his or her own-is going to be a lot better off and feel more secure than someone who has "job security." In reality, those with job security are subject to the whims of moody bosses and scheming coworkers and are forever dreading that they will one day hear two words: "You're fired." (Or these nine: "I'm sorry, but we have to lay you off.") &nbsp; <br><br>Language is powerful stuff. As you read this book, you'll notice that we often lump all our target readers under the umbrella term "independent worker." Here's why: we want you to start seeing yourself as part of a larger community that is rapidly becoming a political force. &nbsp; We are the independent workforce. We are prosperous. We are freelancers, permalancers, temps, consultants, contractors, self-employed, self-reliable, self-starters, and we are here to stay. &nbsp; <br><br>A LEXICON OF INDEPENDENT WORKERS &nbsp; <br>People who work for themselves face similar challenges but are often described differently. Here, we attempt to confuse you all the more. &nbsp; <br><br>Consultant: Often a once gainfully employed individual who either got fed up and quit or was shown the door by an ungrateful employer. Fleet of foot and nimble minded, consultants have rebranded themselves as saviors to the soulless creatures who gave them the boot. Their revenge? This time, they're charging by the hour. &nbsp; <br><br>Day laborers: Workers who typically hire themselves out for a single day for cash pay. The nation would grind to a halt if these overworked and underappreciated workers walked off the job. &nbsp; <br><br>Independent contractor, freelancer: Often used interchangeably. Workers who call themselves freelancers are often people in creative fields: designers, bloggers, producers, animators, software developers, etc. They find their own gigs, do their own invoicing, and are responsible for...everything. Little-known fact: the term "freelance" originated in medieval times and referred to mercenary knights who were free to point their lance at anyone. &nbsp; <br><br>Part-timer: A person who works less than a full, forty-hour work week-sometimes by choice-so he or she can fulfill other obligations, such as child rearing, schoolwork, or the demands of another job. &nbsp; <br><br>Permalancer: A full-time employee who typically works at the same job for an extended period of time-even years-without the usual benefits. On the books, he or she is listed as an "independent contractor" and may even be "laid off" every three months, then rehired for a different "project." This way, the employer can justify not paying for health care or retirement. Some permies prefer their work situations; others are silently praying for the night they meet their boss in a dark alley. &nbsp; <br><br>Self-employed: Though the term can apply broadly to everyone here, speakers who use the term envision an individual who runs a small business and may even have employees. The overpriced dry cleaner on your corner qualifies, as do your doctor, lawyer, architect, and sweet aunt Tookie who runs a B and B. &nbsp; <br><br>Temp: Here today, gone tomorrow, the temporary worker signs up with an agency that sends him or her on missions of corporate importance. The worker never quite fits in or catches on because work at any one place is all too brief. In the end, the agency carves up the pay like a Thanksgiving turkey and feasts upon the meatiest parts. (Some corporations hire temps directly so they can skip the middlemen and fleece the worker themselves.) &nbsp; <br><br>THE REAL PROBLEM &nbsp; <br>The reasons most independent workers have problems with money boil down to two significant things: timing and planning. &nbsp; <br><br>By "timing" we mean how frequently you get paid. Full-time employees get paid every week or every two weeks. By contrast, independent workers collect their pay when the project is done, when they book a new client, or when they sell goods or services (once any overhead is paid off, of course). In other words, they have variable or irregular income. &nbsp; <br><br>By "planning" we mean the complete, systematic organization of one's financial life. For a lot of full-time employees, organization is simply a matter of filling out the forms in their benefits packet. In one fell swoop, they sign up for health care and a 401(k). For the independent worker, things are not so clear-cut. They must do all this for themselves, and often they have no clue where to start. Without planning, you cannot have benefits. Without planning, you won't have insurance, savings, etc. Good planning is essential to your survival as an independent worker. &nbsp; <br><br>We can hear you complaining already. Why make this so complicated? Just teach me about budgeting. All I have to do is make a budget and stick to it. Well, fine. Budgeting is awfully hard when you don't know exactly what you're going to be making every month. Or you might be thinking to yourself, Stop the mumbo jumbo. Just show me how I can save more money. OK, but saving is even harder when things like health care and taxes sneak up on you. &nbsp; <br><br>If your income is variable, you may have found yourself in some of these situations. Heck, we know we have. &nbsp; <br>� You spend the first three months of the year working on an important, well-funded project. You send in the invoice, sure that you will be paid in time to pay your April rent. The invoice gets lost, and the check arrives in late May. You're hosed. &nbsp; <br>� Tax time comes around and-oops-you forgot to pay those quarterly taxes. Now the total is far beyond what you can afford, and the IRS payment goes on the credit card. &nbsp; <br>� You chose to pay your health care quarterly, rather than monthly, because that means you only have to look at the bill four times a year instead of twelve. Out of sight...out of mind. When the statement shows up, you're shocked by an amount that's three times as much as the monthly number for which you've budgeted. &nbsp; <br>� Work has been pretty steady lately, and you have no reason to think things will dry up, so you decide to splurge on a new computer. Instead of saving for it, you put it on your credit card, intending to pay it off in two months. As luck would have it, your shifts get cut back. Six months later, the computer-along with several happy-hour outings and an occasional rent payment-is still on the card. &nbsp; <br><br>None of this sounds new, does it? Well, take heart. Know that your current situation is fixable if you get a handle on timing and planning. &nbsp; <br><br>Understand right now that you're not having these problems because you're not good at what you do, or because there aren't enough jobs, or because you don't have the right company job. You're having them simply because you haven't taken the time to build a financial plan that meshes well with your working style. If you're trying to create financial security as an independent worker, but you are following guidelines that are designed for traditional workers, you're going to get yourself into trouble. It's like practicing to navigate a motocross course, only you're driving a minivan. You can't really be surprised if you crash.</p><h2>Lethal Lies</h2><p><strong>From the </strong><strong><i>New York Times</i></strong><strong> bestselling author of the <i>Dark Protectors</i> series comes a sexy romantic suspense about a woman determined to solve her sister's murder and the only man she can trust with long-buried family secrets. </strong> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong>Revenge.

I was nervous about speaking with the creative brain behind some of my favorite films like <i>Forrest Gump</i>, <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>, and, of course, that epic time-travel trilogy. There were a million things I wanted to query him about, most of them having to do with the project I was working on. It wasn&#x2019;t so much that I was starstruck by the prospect of speaking with him, but when you have a chance to chat with a visionary whose work you respect and admire, it has a way of putting you on edge.</p><p>Or, at least, that&#x2019;s what I attribute my feelings to in hindsight. More likely it was because I had tangible evidence of the benefit of having Robert Zemeckis&#x2014;or Bob Z, as he&#x2019;s known to friends, colleagues, and <i>Back to the Future</i> aficionados&#x2014;on board for this book. A few weeks earlier, when I reached out to Christopher Lloyd&#x2019;s manager, he asked me if Zemeckis was on board. A line was drawn in the sand: The day I spoke to the director would be the day an interview would be scheduled with the Doc.</p><p>Challenge accepted. I hung up the phone with Lloyd&#x2019;s rep and retrieved the index card with Zemeckis&#x2019;s agent&#x2019;s phone number written on it, a three-by-five piece of card stock that had been haunting me ever since I&#x2019;d scribbled on it four months earlier. Without jumping through too many hoops, I got a hold of Zemeckis&#x2019;s assistant, who promptly scheduled a half-hour interview for us, with only one request: &#x201c;We respectfully ask that you contain the time to the thirty minutes which we have allotted.&#x201d; No big deal, I thought, until a week later when it was six minutes before our scheduled interview and the software I use to record Skype calls on my computer stopped working.</p><p>It was 12:24 P.M. Pacific Standard Time. I was based on the East Coast, but had grown accustomed to working my day around what I reductively referred to as &#x201c;Los Angeles Time.&#x201d; Each second became more and more important. There was no way I was going to call Bob Z late. Bob G&#x2014;Bob Gale, cowriter and coproducer of <i>Back to the Future</i> and its subsequent sequels&#x2014;had told me that Zemeckis rarely does interviews on his past work. His rep&#x2019;s words raced through my head, an LED sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. Slowly at first, and then faster and faster, with the print getting larger and larger&#x2014;THIRTY MINUTES WHICH WE HAVE ALLOTTED. THIRTY MINUTES WHICH WE HAVE ALLOTTED. THIRTY MINUTES. THIRTY MINUTES. MINUTES. MINUTES. </p><p>By 12:29, I was stuck with no choice but to use my plan B. I took out my cell phone, deleted a few apps to ensure I had a surplus of memory, and called Zemeckis from my computer, silently praying the microphone on my handheld device was catching everything. I had consolidated all of my questions into six or seven bullet points of topics, deciding it might be easier to let the colloquy unfold naturally, while making sure I got what I needed within the confines of his schedule. And everything did work. Not only was the director a pleasure to speak with, but he was also refreshingly direct about his thoughts on the films and his contributions to cinema in general. Of the many takeaways from our conversation, the most substantial was his continuing pride and astonishment with the enduring legacy of a story that he and Gale had created more than three decades earlier, which wouldn&#x2019;t have seen the light of day were it not for their tenacity and unwavering commitment to their project.</p><p>Set up a Google alert for the words &#x201c;Back to the Future&#x201d; and a day won&#x2019;t go by without a headline from someplace in the world using the title, often without having any connection to the film. Like <i>Jaws</i> a decade earlier, <i>Future</i> set a new precedent for how to create a winning summer blockbuster. As Bob Gale likes to remind aspiring screenwriters, the three things that matter most in a story are characters, characters, and characters. For all of its special and visual effects, the true success of the film lies with Zemeckis and Gale&#x2019;s airtight script, and the distinctive characters that were brought to life by their talented cast. For the thirty years that followed the first film&#x2019;s release, the trilogy has continued to capture the imagination of a generation who, in turn, passed these movies on to their children like beloved family heirlooms.</p><p>I&#x2019;m just young enough to have missed the film&#x2019;s theatrical run, but thanks to one of my aunts&#x2014;who had what seemed like hundreds of VHS tapes when I was growing up&#x2014;I had the fortunate and, for many <i>Future</i> fans, rare experience of being introduced to Hill Valley&#x2019;s inhabitants for the first time in a triple feature. It was a school day, but I had a slight fever and was sent home by the school nurse. With both of my parents at work, my Aunt Stacey, who worked nights, picked me up. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll enjoy these,&#x201d; she said as I sat on her couch under a blanket with some chicken soup beside me. I doubt she had any idea just how much I would. She put the first film in the VCR as I studied the cardboard sleeve of the box. The design, with that guy I recognized from TV with one foot in this strange vehicle and fire running between his legs, seemed magical. I couldn&#x2019;t stop studying it, looking for clues about what was going to unfold over the next few hours. I knew I was in store for a movie unlike anything I had seen before. As the end credits for the first and second installments started, I raced to switch the cassettes, trying my best to continue the story as quickly as possible. When the words &#x201c;THE END&#x201d; appeared on the screen in the last moments of <i>Part III</i>, I decided to let the credits roll in their entirety. By the time my mother came to pick me up, my fever was all but forgotten. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to go to school the next day and tell my friends about Marty McFly, his friend Doc Brown, and the wild adventures I had spent close to six hours watching them get into.</p><p>I have always been an avid reader of behind-the-scenes books about my favorite films and television shows, as they went into greater detail than the standard promotional &#x201c;making of&#x201d; shows that would occasionally pop up on television in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As the thirtieth anniversary of <i>Back to the Future</i> approached, I couldn&#x2019;t believe that a comprehensive book on the making of one of the most culturally significant movies of the past three decades had yet to be written. My goal was to change that, not only by chronicling the filmmaking process, but also by showing how these three films left an indelible stamp on the United States and many other countries around the world.</p><p>When I set out to write this book, it was important for me to speak with as many people who were associated with <i>Back to the Future</i> as possible. The trilogy has been well documented for the past thirty years, in magazines, fan clubs, featurettes on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray, and countless websites like BacktotheFuture .com, the digital hub for all things about the franchise. As one person put it to me, &#x201c;What else can you say about a movie that has been written about continuously for the past thirty years?&#x201d; But even with that abundance of information available, the mythology always felt somewhat incomplete to me. Too few people had retold the same stories too many times. A lot of the behind-the-scenes tales have become so commonplace, whether or not you know them has become a pseudo litmus test among the diehards to determine how big a fan of the film a new member of their tribe is. And I had a feeling that these stories may have been missing some of their original verve.</p><p>Throughout the researching process, I found that my suspicions were true. Many of the anecdotes that have been repeated over the years had been scrubbed clean, condensed to omit significant details, and/or told with minimal context. While interviewing my subjects, I encouraged them to push beyond their stock stories and really remember the past. Or, perhaps more appropriately, the <i>Future</i>. And they did. I could feel people discovering things they had long since forgotten, often with startling accuracy. It&#x2019;s difficult for someone to remember everything they did last week, let alone three decades ago, but the more people I spoke to, the more stories were corroborated, and a comprehensive picture of what it was like to be a part of the team that made cinematic history became clearer.</p><p>As I learned working on my previous two books, there is rarely a person who works on a film who hasn&#x2019;t accumulated an interesting anecdote or two. To that end, I was fortunate that so many people found it worth their time to spare a few minutes for me. In addition to Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, and Christopher Lloyd, whose manager came through on his promise, more than fifty additional people from all facets of production, including actors, producers, members of the camera crew, editors, graphic artists, costumers, and those involved with special and visual effects, signed on to make this project the largest <i>Back to the Future</i> reunion ever assembled. I also spoke with some people who didn&#x2019;t work on the movies, but who are experts on the trilogy&#x2019;s impact, including movie critics, documentarians, and fans who have gone beyond the call of duty to keep the embers glowing for their favorite franchise.</p><p>In writing this book, I relied heavily on more than five hundred hours of interviews I conducted over a twenty-one-month period. All of the quotes that appear in the pages that follow come from those conversations. Some of the quotes have been corrected for clarity, which was done extremely judiciously and with significant care for each interview subject. In scenes where conversations are reconstructed, the dialogue comes either from the account of one person or the synthesis of more than one person&#x2019;s recollection of events. All of the information included has either been corroborated against other sources or reflects what had likely happened based on my appraisal of the validity of each speaker and the veracity of their memory. The result is a reconstructed time capsule of the making of the <i>Back to the Future</i> trilogy, by those who were there to have experienced it.</p><p>As my interview process progressed, I began to realize that this project isn&#x2019;t simply about the making of one film trilogy, but is also about how some of the titans in the movie industry came into being. Even readers who are only casual fans of the films will find interesting pieces of information about the movie business, from the perspective of some of Hollywood&#x2019;s best. At your leisure, look at the list of credits that <i>Future</i> alumni amassed prior to and since working on the films. While you may not recognize every person&#x2019;s name, virtually everyone I spoke with worked on other movies that have received a substantial bit of attention over the years, such as <i>Avatar</i>, <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Fight Club</i>, <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest</i>, <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>, the original <i>Superman</i> franchise, and <i>Titanic</i>, to name just a few. They are incredibly talented visionaries, some of whom were already veterans when filming began in 1984, and others who were just getting started in the business. Regardless of their previous experience, they worked together to make a truly timeless film about time travel.</p><p>What follows is an amalgamation of their truth&#x2014;a profile not only of a film series but, as I was reminded when I spent a half hour on memory lane with Zemeckis, of the beautifully normal and ordinary people whose creativity and passion produced an extraordinary trilogy. Some of the decisions they made were unconventional, yet they paid off, despite the odds. The trilogy has forever changed the landscape of cinema by redefining what a summer blockbuster could be, who could star in one, and under what improbable circumstances a trio of films could have a major impact around the world. You may not believe <i>Back to the Future</i> is the most important film trilogy of all time now, but after reading this book I bet you will.</p><p>So buckle up, because if my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, you&#x2019;re going to see some serious shit.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. THINK, MCFLY, THINK</p><p>Sunday, December 30, 1984</p><p>Filming had only been under way for less than a month, but already something wasn&#x2019;t quite right. On what should have been his day off, Robert Zemeckis made his way into the double-wide trailer that would remain parked behind the Amblin Entertainment compound for the next several months. Since all the editing rooms inside the studio offices were delegated to other projects, Steven Spielberg had arranged for coeditors Arthur Schmidt and Harry Keramidas to make the temporary structure their permanent workspace as they pieced together <i>Back to the Future</i>, Universal Pictures&#x2019; film scheduled for release Memorial Day weekend.</p><p>The director made his way through the bullpen, which normally would have been buzzing with assistants and apprentices filing film trims and outtakes into the large cardboard boxes that lined the wall. But because it was a weekend, it was a virtual ghost town, with the exception of the two other living souls in the building, Schmidt and Keramidas. The editors were tucked away in the former&#x2019;s makeshift office, seated in front of a modestly sized monitor. Next to them sat a chair&#x2014;the most comfortable chair in the office&#x2014;that remained empty except during these visits from Zemeckis. Increasingly, these meetings had become fairly commonplace by this point in the shooting schedule, weeks after their November 26 start date. The production team expected principal photography to wrap after about twenty-two weeks of filming, meaning there would be fewer than three months between the last shot being captured and <i>Future</i>&#x2019;s late May release date. As if the timeline weren&#x2019;t tight enough to begin with, there were several optical effects that would have to be added in postproduction by George Lucas&#x2019;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), further constricting the schedule.</p><p>To expedite the process, Zemeckis would come into the cutting room at the end of his shooting days and on weekends to look at scenes in the process of being put together. Zemeckis grew to trust his editors, especially Artie, who had been nominated for an Academy Award a few years prior for his work on<i> Coal Miner&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, another Universal release. His meticulous editing skills led him to be hired after a serendipitous meeting a few months earlier. &#x201c;I was working on a film at Paramount called <i>Firstborn</i>, and we had two young teenage boys in the movie,&#x201d; he says, likely referring to Christopher Collet and Robert Downey, Jr. &#x201c;Bob was looking everywhere for somebody to play Marty. He called up the director, Michael Apted, and asked if he could see some film of the two boys. Michael didn&#x2019;t want to let the film out of the cutting room because he was still shooting, and I was close-cutting it as we went along, so he asked...</p></p><h2>Let the Water Hold Me Down</h2><p>Fiction.

Armed with a healthy dose of wit and curiosity, medical journalist Randi Hutter Epstein takes us on a journey through the unusual history of these potent chemicals from a basement filled with jarred nineteenth-century brains to a twenty-first-century hormone clinic in Los Angeles.</p><p>Brimming with fascinating anecdotes, illuminating new medical research, and humorous details, <em>Aroused</em> introduces the leading scientists who made life-changing discoveries about the hormone imbalances that ail us, as well as the charlatans who used those discoveries to peddle false remedies. Epstein exposes the humanity at the heart of hormone science with her rich cast of characters, including a 1920s doctor promoting vasectomies as a way to boost libido, a female medical student who discovered a pregnancy hormone in the 1940s, and a mother who collected pituitaries, a brain gland, from cadavers as a source of growth hormone to treat her son.

It includes two choices of one-month cycles and three choices of two-week cycles. If you rotate among these, you can easily provide great mealtime variety. We suggest that you start with a cycle from the book to get used to the method. Then you can experiment with adding family-favorite recipes. Turn to chapter 9 for help in adapting the method to your own recipes.Each of the menu cycles gives you a menu calendar that shows the month&#x2019;s entr�es at a glance, a grocery shopping list, a list of staples you should have on hand (add to the grocery list any you don&#x2019;t have), a list of the containers you will need for freezing the entr�es, step-by-step instructions for preparing the recipes in sequence on your cooking day, and finally the recipes themselves, in the order you will prepare them.To serve an entr�e, you will need to thaw the dish and heat it. While it is being heated, you can prepare a vegetable, salad, or perhaps a dessert to serve with it. The time-consuming preparation and cleanup is done all at once on your megacooking day!Since many of the entr�es can be frozen in freezer bags instead of bulkier hard-sided containers, even a month&#x2019;s cycle can be stored in the freezer section of your refrigerator.Just make sure you make room by cleaning it out before your cooking day. Sooner or later we need to deal with those hard knots of leftovers anyway! Right after cooking day you will probably not have room in the refrigerator&#x2019;s freezer for things like ice cream and loaves of bread, but as you use entr�es from the freezer you can add these to it.The recipes in Once-a-Month Cooking come not from stainless-steel test kitchens, but have been tested numerous times in homes by cooks of varying skills. We have selected recipes we think your family will eat and enjoy. They were chosen for taste, variety, nutritional value, easily available ingredients, and how well they lend themselves to freezing.You will find that the recipes vary in serving size. The average is 5 or 6 servings. Some serve 4; a few serve 12. Depending on the ages (and eating habits) of your children, if you have four or fewer family members, you may want to divide and freeze each larger-serving entr�e in two or more meal-size portions. The largest recipes are great for serving to company or ensuring leftovers the following day.You may find that the one-month menu cycle actually feeds your family for five or six weeks or more--particularly if you occasionally eat out or supplement your menu with dinner salads or easy meals like grilled meats and vegetables.Chapter 8 provides creative ways to serve fresh seasonal vegetables and other accompaniments with your entr�es--as well as a few sweet treats to have on hand in your freezer. We think you will be as excited as we are about the wealth of ideas presented by our friend Rebecca Pasquariello, chef and owner of Savor Fresh Foods.Consult chapter 10 for helpful information on such things as freezing tips and food-measurement equivalents.Are you ready to cook? Or at least ready to think about getting ready to cook? Here are some tips to streamline the process.First, read this introductory material. Then choose which menu cycle you would like to try this month and read through that chapter so you&#x2019;ll know what&#x2019;s ahead.Next comes the hardest part: mark off the time on your calendar to grocery shop and cook! These should be on adjacent days. Don&#x2019;t try to shop and cook on the same day, especially if you have young children, or you won&#x2019;t like us very much! You simply won&#x2019;t have the time or energy to do both. You might also not like us about four hours into your cooking day, when your feet are complaining and every pot and pan you own is dirty. But we are consoled by the thought that you will like us very much when you peek at your larder, carefully labeled and layered in your freezer, as well as each day thereafter at about 5:00 p.m. The one-month cycles require about a nine-hour day (of course this varies with the cook). The two-week cycles take about five hours.Cook with a friend or your spouse or an older child. The day goes so much more quickly when you divide the work and add conversation. If you have young children, a cooking companion can help tend the kids, answer the phone, and wipe the counters. You can either divide the food between your two families or cook one day a month at your friend&#x2019;s home and one day a month at your own.Trust us that you will want to go out to dinner on cooking day! Yes, we know you will have plenty on hand for dinner. But you won&#x2019;t want to face any of it on your plate. This will pass. Go out, then have your spouse and kids wash the pots and pans.Err on the side of buying a little more produce, chicken, and ground beef than is called for on your shopping lists. You can always use these for salads, soups, and sandwiches. If you have chicken broth left over, freeze it in an ice cube tray. When the cubes are frozen, pop them into a freezer bag. You can pull out a cube when a recipe calls for chicken broth, or make spur-of-the-moment chicken soup with leftovers.You may want to photocopy the recipes and attach them to large index cards. In many cases you will be working on more than one recipe at a time. You can lay out your recipe cards in sequence to save you from having to keep turning the pages.Don&#x2019;t even think about trying to do extra baking on your cooking day. If you enjoy making pie crust and want to use your own rather than a store-bought one, prepare the pie crust a couple of days ahead.Finally, although you need to free yourself of commitments on your cooking day, the day will go much more easily if you feel free to take a break to tend to the children&#x2019;s needs, make a phone call, or just sit down to rest! Wear shoes that give your feet good support. Listen to your favorite music. Crack open a kitchen window for ventilation and to let the good smells pour out.The secret of the method involves doing all similar processes at once: browning ground beef and chopping onions and cooking chicken only once rather than several times a month. Imagine the hours this saves!Grocery Shopping HintsBefore you go to the supermarket or warehouse store, read the grocery and staples lists for the menu cycle you plan to use. The staples list contains items you need but probably have on hand. Look through your cupboards and add any missing staple items to the grocery shopping list. Also check the list of suggested freezer containers to see if you need to buy any of them.For added convenience, photocopy the grocery list that we provide, then write in the other staple items or containers you&#x2019;ll need to buy. The grocery lists have been categorized by sections of food to help speed you through the store.If you shop for a one-month menu cycle, you will have to push one cart and pull another. You may need to budget more carefully in order to set aside the funds needed to purchase food for all your dinner entr�es at once. But keep in mind that over the course of the month you will save money on your food bill by cooking this way, since you&#x2019;ll be buying in bulk, eating out less often, and eliminating unplanned trips to the supermarket.Your shopping trip will take you a couple of hours, so don&#x2019;t try to wedge it between two appointments. If you take young children, be sure to go when everyone is well fed and rested. It also helps to break up the trip. For example, go at midmorning to a discount food store to buy in bulk, have lunch at a favorite spot, and then finish any leftover shopping at the supermarket. Since this will be a lengthy shopping trip, plan your route through the supermarket so you visit the meat and dairy aisles last. If a friend or relative can baby-sit for you on shopping day, you will accomplish more in less time.When you get home from shopping, you don&#x2019;t have to put everything away. Stack the canned goods and dry ingredients on a table or counter because you&#x2019;ll be using them soon. Keeping them within sight can inspire you for the task ahead!The grocery shopping lists include some items with asterisks (*). These can be stored, because you will not need them until the day you serve the corresponding entr�e. Mark the labels of these items to remind you not to use them by mistake.The Day Before Cooking DayAfter you&#x2019;ve returned from the grocery store, clear off the kitchen counters, removing any appliances you won&#x2019;t be using. Create as much free countertop space as you can. Then, following the &#x201c;Equipment Needed for Cooking Day&#x201d; list, pull out your food processor, mixer, bowls--the tools you will need. If you have room, you may also want to get out the staple items.Make sure you have all needed groceries on hand. Then perform the tasks that your chosen menu cycle outlines for &#x201c;The Day Before Cooking Day.&#x201d;If you don&#x2019;t have a food processor to chop and slice the vegetables, you may want to cut them up the day before cooking, since this is one of the most time-consuming tasks. Then store these vegetables (except mushrooms) in the refrigerator in cold water inside tightly sealed plastic containers. Or omit the water and seal them in zip-closure bags.Finally, check the list of freezer containers needed for the entr�es in your menu cycle and get out the ones you&#x2019;ll need. You can usually store entr�es in freezer bags, unless they are layered (like lasagna) or contain a lot of liquid. Food stored in freezer bags can be thawed in the bag and then warmed in a suitable container.Cooking DayThe assembly order for each menu cycle is a step-by-step guide to preparing all your entrees. Read through the assembly order before you start to cook. Since you will usually be working on more than one recipe at a time, getting an overview will give you a sense of how the steps flow together.The following suggestions will help make this method work best for you:Place an empty trash can ...</p></p><h2>The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics (Dover Books on Western Philosophy)</h2><p>The final published book by Nobel Prize-winning author and philosopher Henri Bergson (1859&#x2013;1941), <i>La pens�e et le mouvant</i> (translated here as <i>The Creative Mind),</i> is a masterly autobiography of his philosophical method. Through essays and lectures written between 1903 and 1923, Bergson retraces how and why he became a philosopher, and crafts a fascinating critique of philosophy itself. Until it leaves its false paths, he demonstrates, philosophy will remain only a wordy dialectic that surmounts false problems.<br>With masterful skill and intensity, Bergson shows that metaphysics and science must&nbsp;be rooted in experience for philosophy to become a genuine search for truth. And in the quest for unanswered questions, the spiritual dimension of human life and the importance of intuition&nbsp;must be emphasized. A source of inspiration for physicists as well as philosophers, Bergson's introduction to metaphysics reveals a philosophy that is always on the move, blending man's spiritual drive with his mastery of the material world.</p><p>"The Creative Mind", the last of Henri Bergson's works to be published, is a masterly autobiography of his philosophical method: how he became a philosopher, why he is a philosopher, and what philosophy must be. These, the man and his work, compose a definite critique of philosophy. His skill is matched by his intensity: his "calling" shines through on every page. <p>Until philosophy leaves its false paths, Bergson demonstrates, it will remain a wordy dialectic, a beating of false problems, and it will never become a search for truth. How this search is to be undertaken is carefully outlined by the author. He builds as he destroys, using the rubble of the old to build the new. His is a philosophy on the move, the rationale of man's spiritual drive, the mind gathering strength from its mastery of the of the material world to contemplate itself, to find at the core of intuition the moving element of discovery and free the possessive sense of novelty. Life is to be grasped in handfuls, but with the sure grasp of discipline.</p></p><h2>By Heart: Conversations with Martin Luther&#39;s Small Catechism</h2><p><p>This comprehensive resource for the study of Martin Luther's Small Catechism examines the Small Catechism as a historical, confessional document rich with history and applicable to life today.

His moving and personal meditation on fatherhood is split into two stylistically separate sections. In the first, Auster reflects on the memories of his father who was a distant, undemonstrative, and cold man who died an untimely death. As he sifts through his Father&#x2019;s things, Auster uncovers a sixty-year-old murder mystery that sheds light on his father&#x2019;s elusive character. In the second section, the perspective shifts and Auster begins to reflect on his own identity as a father by adopting the voice of a narrator, &#x201c;A.&#x201d; Through a mosaic of images, coincidences, and associations &#x201c;A,&#x201d; contemplates his separation from his son, his dying grandfather, turning the story into a self-conscious reflection on the process of writing.</p><p>Beginning with the deconstructed detective novels of the New York Trilogy, Paul Auster has proved himself to be one of the most adventurous writers in contemporary fiction. In book after book, he seems compelled to reinvent his style from scratch. Yet he always returns to certain preoccupations--most notably, solitude and coincidence--and these themes get a powerful workout in this early memoir. In the first half, &#34;Portrait of an Invisible Man,&#34; Auster comes to terms with the death of his father, and as he investigates this elusive figure, he makes a rather shocking (and enlightening) discovery about his family&#39;s history. The second half, &#34;The Book of Memory,&#34; finds the author on more abstract ground, toying with the entwined metaphors of coincidence, translation, solitude, and language. But here, too, the autobiographical element gives an extra kick to Auster&#39;s prose and keeps him from sliding off into armchair aesthetics. An eloquent, mesmerizing book.Paul Auster is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The New York Trilogy</i>&nbsp;and many other critically acclaimed novels.

God meant husband and wife to walk together, talk together, work together, and sleep together. As the Puritans said, God did not make the woman out of man&#x2019;s head to control him, or out of his feet for him to trample on her, but out of his side to be embraced near to his heart. Here is a book of practical encouragements for two key aspects of marriage: companionship and sex. Dr. Joel Beeke draws upon the wisdom of the Holy Scriptures and over three decades of pastoral ministry to present a dozen practical principles for fanning into flame the fire of love between husband and wife. The Bible has a higher aim than a satisfying marriage, namely, glorying in God forever. Marriage will one day be done, made obsolete by the magnificent relationship between Christ and His people. Even now, marriage is neither the chief purpose nor the highest joy of man. But the Scriptures do call wedded people to glorify God here and now through their marriages. Dr. Beeke&#x2019;s book aims to assist them in this. In Part I (&#x201c;Friends&#x201d;), the book explores the meaning, cultivation, and threats to friendship in marriage. Friendship is that personal bond of shared life that brings people together in delightful harmony. It is rooted God&#x2019;s created order of making men and women in His image. We broke this harmonious order when our first parents sinned against God, simultaneously turning against each other. But Christ is the great peacemaker and friendship-restorer. Cultivating friendship with your spouse is hard work, but profoundly rewarding. It revolves around sharing life together. The book gives guidance in how to share yourself with your spouse through the gifts of time, discussing decisions, listening to each other&#x2019;s feelings, talking about how God is at work in your lives, praying together, building trust, laughing together, giving thanks, pleasing your spouse, and finding shared interests. It also walks the reader through the minefields of giving and receiving correction, honoring in-laws, having balanced friendship with others, and supporting on another in crises. Above all, we must remember that our most important friendship is with our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone can walk with us through life, death, and eternity. In Part II (&#x201c;Lovers&#x201d;), Dr. Beeke sets forth several ways in which the gospel energizes married Christians to enjoy sex in holy delight. The words &#x201c;gospel,&#x201d; &#x201c;sex,&#x201d; and &#x201c;holy,&#x201d; may not seem to go together. This book shows that in reality sexual love between husband and wife is both a holy duty pleasing to God and blessed privilege empowered by Christ&#x2019;s grace. Rather than splitting our lives into different compartments such as sex and religion, God calls us to respond to Christ&#x2019;s mercies by offering our whole existence to Him as a living sacrifice. The Bible teaches us doctrines like the image of God in man, the creation mandate God laid upon the human race, the moral law for marriage, forgiveness of sins by faith in Christ, sanctification by divine grace, Christ&#x2019;s call to take up our cross, adoption by God, and turning from idols to give thanks to God. All these doctrines have massive implications for our sexual relationship with our spouses. However these doctrines must do more than sit in our minds; they must sink into our hearts. In Reformed, experiential fashion, Dr. Beeke leads the reader to know, believe, feel, and act based upon God&#x2019;s Word applied by God&#x2019;s Spirit. Friendship and sex with your spouse are incredibly good gifts from God. We should receive them with gratitude, and give them to each other with generosity. But these things cannot be your life. They are just not big enough. Only God Himself, given in Christ the Mediator, can be sufficient for all we need and desire. Therefore, as this book reminds us, pursue friendship and sexual love with your spouse but rest your heart in God alone.</p><p>Dr. Joel R.

Marathon, Cannae, Tours, Agincourt, Austerlitz, Sedan, Stalingrad--all resonate in the literature of war and in our imaginations as tide-turning. But were they? As Cathal J. Nolan demonstrates in this magisterial and sweeping work, victory in major wars usually has been determined in other ways. Even the most legendarily lopsided of battles did not necessarily decide their outcomes. Nolan also challenges the hoary concept of the military "genius," even of the Great Captains--from Alexander to Frederick and Napoleon--mapping instead the descent into total war.<br><br><em>The Allure of Battle</em> systematically recreates and analyzes the major campaigns among the Great Powers, from the Middle Ages through the 20th century, from the fall of Byzantium to the defeat of the Axis powers, tracing the illusion of "short-war thinking," the hope that victory might be swift and conflict brief. Such has almost never been the case. Even one-sided battles have mainly contributed to victory or defeat by accelerating erosion of the other side's defenses, resources, and will.<br><br>Massive conflicts, the so-called "people's wars," beginning with Napoleon and continuing until the end of World War II, have been more fundamentally determined by prolonged stalemate and attrition, wars in which the determining factor was not tactical but industrial.<br><br>Nolan's masterful book places battles squarely and mercilessly within the context of the wider conflict in which they took place. In the process it help corrects a distorted view of their role in war, replacing popular images of "decisive battles" with somber appreciation of the sacrifice and endurance necessary to victory. Accessible, provocative, exhaustive, and illuminating, <em>The Allure of Battle</em> will spark fresh debate about the history and conduct of warfare.<br></p><p><br><strong>Cathal J.

A must-read for students of military history." - Kirkus Reviews (Starred review) <br><p></p><br>"In a sweeping narrative that ranges from the Middle Ages through World War II, Cathal Nolan dismantles an illusion that has persistently distorted our understanding of armed conflict - that of the decisive battle engineered by the genius general. But the importance of this brilliantly provocative book is not merely historical. Its conclusions apply directly to war and military policy in the present day." - Andrew J. Bacevich, author of <em>America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History</em> <br><p></p><br>"Why do so many generals overpromise and under-deliver, from Breitenfeld to Basra? We buy the hype because we want quick results at low cost. Yet the blood-sodden reality is almost always quite different. In seeking the <em>Allure of Battle</em>, Cathal Nolan draws on the broad sweep on Western military history. He explains what went wrong, and why, with wit, insight, and a knowing eye for the heroes and cads who made it so. Battles rarely deliver convincing results. But Cathal Nolan sure does." - Daniel P.

So claims Bertrand Russell at the outset of <em>In Praise of Idleness</em>, a collection of essays in which he espouses the virtues of cool reflection and free enquiry; a voice of calm in a world of maddening unreason. From a devastating critique of the ancestry of fascism to a vehement defence of 'useless' knowledge, with consideration given to everything from insect pests to the human soul,&nbsp;this is a tour de force that only Bertrand Russell could perform.</p><p>Bertrand Russell (1872-1970).

The case never went to trial because it threatened to undercut the meaning and significance of Union victory. Cynthia Nicoletti describes the interactions of the lawyers who worked on both sides of the Davis case - who saw its potential to disrupt the verdict of the battlefield against secession. In the aftermath of the Civil War, Americans engaged in a wide-ranging debate over the legitimacy and effectiveness of war as a method of legal adjudication. Instead of risking the &#39;wrong&#39; outcome in the highly volatile Davis case, the Supreme Court took the opportunity to pronounce secession unconstitutional in Texas v.

Besides containing important passages, scenes, and events excluded from other abridgements, this edition includes eight useful interpretive essays that address indigenous religions and cultural practices, sexuality during the early colonial period, the roles of women in indigenous cultures, and analysis of the political and economic purposes behind Diaz del Castillo's narrative. A series of maps illuminate the routes of the conquistadors, the organization of indigenous settlements, the struggle for the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, as well as the disastrous Spanish journey to Honduras.

Urged by his doctor to keep his sodium intake "under 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams a day," Don headed for the kitchen and went to work devising recipes for delicious low-sodium dishes that added up to less than 500 milligrams daily. The results? Don's name has been removed from the transplant list, and Don shared his recipes with the world in <i>The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Cookbook</i>.</p><p>Readers of that first book have kept in touch with Don via his Web site, and have written him letters asking for more. What they most often ask for is a book with more bread recipes, more recipes for cakes and cookies and muffins and tea breads, more of all those great baked things--in short, for the book you now hold in your hands. Don teamed up with his daughter, professional nutritionist Dr. Jeannie Gazzaniga Moloo, to fill <i>The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Baking Book</i> with recipes that are as healthy and delicious as possible. As in the previous book, they tell you just how much sodium is in each ingredient. They provide satisfactory substitutes for flavorings that patients with congestive heart failure and high blood pressure shouldn't have. All easy to make and delicious to eat. Go for it!</p></p><p><p><b>Don Gazzaniga</b> retired from the communications industry a few years ago. Since he changed his diet to the very low-sodium dishes he has devised, he is again able to pursue his hobby of fishing as well as take moderate walks. He lives in Loomis, California.</p>People compelled to control their sodium intake will welcome <i>The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Baking Book</i>. Following his earlier cookbook, Donald A. Gazzaniga shows how to ensure that those who can't tolerate sodium can still enjoy flavorful baked goods. Gazzaniga covers both yeast-raised and quick breads. The latter require special sodium-free baking powder to achieve the lowest sodium levels. Garlic-cheese focaccia, French onion bread, and Italian sourdough make for good sandwiches. Sweet breads, including one with oats, dates, and prunes, provide plenty of fiber. Cookie recipes, especially those for biscotti, supply plenty of spicy flavor without compromising on sodium levels. Gazzaniga also shares nutritional information for diabetics, and he further explains how to make his recipes suitable for sugar-restricted diets. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Amid the Troubles, Detective Sean Duffy, a Catholic cop in the Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary, struggles with burnout as he investigates a brutal double murder and suicide. Did Michael Kelly really shoot his parents at point-blank and then jump off a nearby cliff? A suicide note points to this conclusion, but Duffy suspects even more sinister circumstances. He soon discovers that Kelly was present at a decadent Oxford party where a cabinet minister's daughter died of a heroin overdose, which may or may not have something to do with Kelly's subsequent death.</p><p>New evidence leads elsewhere: gun runners, arms dealers, the British government, and a rogue American agent with a fake identity.

She was married to writer and broadcaster Gordon Snell for thirty-five years. She passed away in 2012 at the age of seventy-two.Narrator Terry Donnelly more than earns her keep from the word "go." The novel's opening scenes require her to vocalize characters from England, Germany, Greece, Ireland, and the United States, and she applies authentic accents to each. As these characters--residents and tourists on a Greek island--witness a tragedy, they form unique bonds through which they come to resolve personal issues. Donnelly beautifully emotes the pain, regret, and joy Binchy's characters experience. She characterizes young and old, male and female with fitting, believable, and easily distinguishable voices. The author's pleasant, if protracted, story shines amid Donnelly's charming and spirited reading.

When, one day, she finally musters the courage to introduce herself, the chemistry between them is undeniable: Thomas is wise, witty, handsome, mysterious, clearly a kindred spirit. There's just one tiny problem: He's dead.<br><br>Stuck in a surreal limbo governed by bureaucracy, Thomas is unable to "cross over" to the afterlife until he completes a 90-day stint on earth, during which time he is forbidden to get involved with a member of the living-lest he incur "regrets." When Thomas and Rachel break this rule, they unleash a cascade of bizarre, troubling consequences. <br><br>Set in the hallucinatory borderland between life and death, <i>The Regrets</i> is a gloriously strange and breathtakingly sexy exploration of love, the cataclysmic power of fantasies, and the painful, exhilarating work of waking up to reality, told with uncommon grace and humor by a visionary artist at the height of her imaginative power.<br></p><p>Amy Bonnaffons is the author of the story collection <i>The Wrong Heaven</i>.

At once love story, ghost story, and low-key philosophical investigation into the nature of existence, <i>The Regrets</i> is a supernatural tale about the super natural vagaries of love: the transcendence of attraction, the haunting of possession, and the potency of daydream."<b></b>&#x2015;<b><i>Rachel Lyon, author of <i>Self-Portrait with Boy</i></i></b><br><br>"In Amy Bonnaffons's remarkable debut novel, <i>The Regrets</i>, love is spectral-both literally and figuratively. This is a book about ghosts and angels and dreams, but its emotional register is grounded and unmistakably human. <i>The Regrets</i> examines the way wisdom can interfere with fulfillment and self-protection with the joy of living. It is somehow both sly and earnest, humorous and haunting. Bonnaffons reads like Haruki Murakami for the millennial generation; she is weird, tender, and full of magic."&#x2015;<b><i>Lucy Tan, author of <i>What We Were Promised</i></i></b></p><h2>Supernova (Light Years, 2)</h2><p><b>Kass Morgan, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of The 100, once again delivers pulse-pounding action and glittering romance in this thrilling sequel to <i>Light Years</i>.</b><br><br> Tensions are rising between the Quatrans and the Specters, and the Quatra Fleet is gearing up for an epic fight.

This edition comes up to date, covering the movie, <i>And Another Thing</i> by Eoin Colfer and the build up to the 30th anniversary of the first novel.Acclaimed author Neil Gaiman celebrates the life and work of Douglas Adams who, in a field in Innsbruck in 1971, had an idea that became <i>The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy</i>. The radio series that started it all, the five &#x2014; soon to be six &#x2014; book &#x2018;trilogy&#x2019;, the TV series, almost-film and actual film, and everything in between.</p><p>Neil Gaiman is a New York Times best-selling author and one of the most critically acclaimed living comics writers. There have been two recent movie adaptations of his work, <i>Stardust</i> and <i>Coraline</i>.LETTERS TO DOUGLAS ADAMS&#x201c;I'm terribly grateful for the fans - apart from anything else, they provide my bread and butter. I'm obviously delighted there are so many people who enjoy this stuff. But I try to keep a little bit of distance because I believe the most dangerous thing a person can do is believe their own publicity. I know, from people I look up to and admire - for instance, John Cleese: it took me a long time to be able to perceive him as an ordinary human being, and I know how very very easy it is to look at somebody who is actually a perfectly normal human being, who happens to have a particular talent, an ability or facility that puts them into the limelight, to see them as being some sort of very elevated and extraordinary person, which they're not. I think you do yourself a favour if you try not to expose yourself too much to people who are going to tell you you are God's gift to the human race, which you're not. The media present you as being some kind of superhuman, and you aren't, so you just have to keep all that at arm's length.&#x201c;It's rather curious when I discover that a phrase of mine has entered the language. I mean, one never seriously thinks that what one gets up to at home has much effect on anything else, and though you see the bestseller lists, and get letters and royalty statements it doesn't impinge on me that it has that kind of effect on other people. I don't want to believe that it does.&#x201c;People like me don't make the gossip pages because they don't know our faces. I get the advantages of being famous with none of the disadvantages. It's startling when somebody does recognise me - I feel slightly vulnerable when it occurs. I can understand why writers take a pseudonym. It's strange having an existence in other people's minds which has little to do with you. It's not the same me they wrote about on my school reports.&#x201d;- Douglas Adams, on fame, 1985.Browsing through Douglas Adams's letters file is a truly mind-expanding experience. All human life, and a fair amount of putative alien life, is there. Certain themes, however, tend to recur. Most people wanted to know where he got his ideas. (One American would-be author wanted to know if she could have any leftover ideas he didn't need.) Others asked questions, wanted advice, proposed marriage or sex, and occasionally offered solutions to matters raised in the books.Three students from Huddersfield University, for example, claim to have discovered the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything...The Answer to &#x201c;The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&#x201d; is not in fact 42, but is stored in the reproductive cells of all life forms and this answer is found via 42. To explain better: all, or most, cells reproduce by splitting in two to form two cells.Thus, one cell becomes two, two becomes four... and so on. It follows that the Answer must, therefore be some power of two. Deep Thought came up with the number 42, and this is indeed the power to which 2 must be raised to find this answer...Thus, by obtaining 242 - 4398046511104 - reducing it to morse code, turning the morse code into letters, rearranging the letters into passable words, and interpreting the Answer thus obtained they were able to work out what the question was. I would not dare to give the game away by revealing it, but will simply say that any Cabbalistic scholar would have been proud of their work. You may reproduce it if you wish.These are some of the most common questions he was asked...Q: What was the Dire Straits song from So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish?A: The Dire Straits song is 'Tunnel of Love' and it's on the Making Movies album.Q: Did you steal the biscuits story from Jeffrey Archer?A: The origin of the story about the biscuits was that it actually happened to me at Cambridge Station, England, in 1976; since when I've told the story so often on radio and TV that people have begun to pinch it. This is why I wanted to put it down in black and white myself. I didn't know Jeffrey Archer had used a similar story in A Quiver Full of Arrows (1982) having never read the book. I would point out that the date, 1982, comes somewhat after the date 1976.Q: What was the Question of &#x201c;Life, the Universe, and Everything&#x201d;?A: The actual question for which Arthur Dent has been seeking has now been revealed to me. It is this:As soon as I've managed to decipher it - and I'm waiting for someone to send me a primer for the language in which it is written, and it may be some time - I will let you know.To a thirteen year-old young novelist, who was having great difficulty thinking up names for characters:A: If you are having trouble in thinking up character names you are probably using the wrong kind of coffee. Have you tried an Italian blend?Q: How do you mix a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?A: I'm afraid it is impossible to mix a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in Earth's atmospheric conditions, but as an alternative I suggest you buy up the contents of your local liquor store, pour them into a large bucket and re-distil them three times. I'm sure your friends would appreciate this.Q: What is the point of Doctor Who?A: The whole point of Doctor Who is that, if you take the second letter of each of the fifty-ninth words of all the episodes over the last twenty years of broadcast and run them together backwards, the original location of the lost city of Atlantis is revealed. I hope this answers your question.To a student who wished to do a thesis on scientific and philosophical themes in Hitchhiker's:A: Most of the ideas in Hitchhiker's come from the logic of jokes, and any relation they bear to anything in the real world is usually completely coincidental.To someone enquiring where Arthur got the copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, and in which pub in Taunton Fenchurch and Arthur met:A: Although copies of the actual Guide have never been published on Earth, copies of it are freely (or rather, expensively) available throughout the Galaxy. Arthur acquired another one for himself on his journey back to Earth - in other words, between the end of Life, the Universe and Everything and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. Although I set the pub scene in Taunton, the pub I had in mind was in fact one in Gillingham in Dorset, the name of which (wisely) I forget.Q: Will you ever novelise the Doctor Who episodes you wrote?A: As far as The Pirate Planet or City of Death are concerned, although I wouldn't mind adapting them into books at some time in the future, there are far too many other things that I want to do in the meantime. Certainly I don't want anyone else doing them though! As for Shada - no, I don't particularly want to see that done. I think that it's not such a great story, and has only gained the notoriety it has got because no one's seen it. If it had been finished and broadcast, it would have never have aroused so much interest.Often he received numbered questions, which often got numbered answers:Q:1) Why did you decide to start writing?2) What aspects of science fiction are you 'ripping off'?3) What experiences do you feel affected your attitudes and values?4) Can your feelings be linked with those of any of the characters in your books?5) What is your background?6) Why do you write science fiction rather than normal fiction?7) Do you enjoy writing?8) What do you think is your 'style' of writing?A: 1) Because I couldn't think of anything else to do. 2) Are you sure you mean the same by 'ripping off' as I do? 3) All of them. 4) Some of them. 5) Varied. 6) I'm not sure. 7) No. 8) Both.Q:1) How long did it take you to write Life, the Universe and Everything?2) Are any of the characters designed from your own personality?3) Have you ever considered doing a comic book?4) Who is your favourite character in the trilogy?5) Where did you get the inspiration to do your books?A:1) Several months.2) No.3) No.4) Don't have one.5) From a mail order company in Iowa.Q:1) Why did you start to write?2) Why do you write science fiction?3) Where do you get your ideas from?A:1) Because I was broke.2) I didn't mean to. I just exaggerate a lot.3) A small mail order firm in Cleveland.Q:1) How do you come up with those names?2) What gave you the idea to write the books?3) Why this subject?4) When did you decide to become an author and why?5) Did you like the results of the books?6) Why did you put Ford and Arthur on Ancient Earth?7) How long did it take to write the books?A: 1) Yes. 2) 37.5. 3) No.4) Somerset.5) Last Thursday morning. 6) French. 7) No.And finally, a letter that Douglas scrawled answers on, but which was never posted, since the correspondent had omitted his name and address...1) Do you parallel yourself on any of the main characters? How?No.2) How did working with the Monty Python Troupe affect your work?I didn't. I knew them but did not work with them.3) How often have you been railroaded or forced into doing something you just didn't want to do (as Arthur Dent in Life, the Universe and Everything)?37 times.4) Do you believe in fate, and do you try to put this idea across in your work?No.5) Could you include a short autobiography, including anything that you consider contributing to your work?Born 1952. Haven't died yet.6) What is your favourite planet? Earth. It's the only one I know.7) Did you do much research before doing the writing? None.8) Have you studied history in depth? Semi-depth. 9) What is your main message in Life, the Universe and Everything?No message. If I'd wanted to write a message I'd have written a message. I wrote a book.10) Have you ever had experiences similar to that your characters have?No.11) Have you ever been hounded by the Galactic police for the whereabouts of one Zaphod Beeblebrox?No. They are fictional characters.SEX AND THE SINGLE HITCHHIKER...Since I have such an in-depth knowledge of your work I feel I am worthy of meeting you and chatting to you about our dear friends Trill, Zaphod, and not forgetting miserable Marvin. Please write and let me know when and where you would like to arrange a meeting...(M.D. London)I'm mostly to be found 33,000 feet above Iceland, but if you feel like popping up for a drink I'd be glad to say hello.Dear Mr Adams,Rest easy - I'm not a Beverly Hills real estate agent. If you're still unmarried and have no children and you're interested in girls, pick up the phone next time you're in New York City, dial (xxxxx) and ask for Marion. I would love to meet the man behind that silly grin. References furnished on request.Dear Mr Adams,Let me start by telling you I'm not a Surrey Estate Agent. (God, the number of letters you must have had starting with that.) I will get straight to the point. I'm formally offering you the opportunity of an affair with me, you have been selected out of many WORLD-FAMOUS writers of humerus [sic] prose to be the recipient of a romantic involvement with me, the duration of which will depend on:a) Whether [sic] or not we speak the same language, andb) How good you are at screwing.The young lady in question said she was five feet eight, nine stone six, a brunette with multicoloured eyes, and described herself as discreet, adventurous, agile, willing to do anything provided it doesn't do me permanent physical damage and I've a good phone manner. Douglas did not reply.Then there was the fan letter from an American writer, hopefully working on a film script, who explained: It's a lot of work, but I break the monotony getting laid in the back bars by pretending to be you.Thanks.FRUITCAKESDear Mr Adams,Thank you for no longer writing about Zaphod Beeblebrox, because I grew to feel a keen sense of identification with him from acquiring two heads, a fleet, and experiencing the Flying City in the Pyramids, your HHGG Corporation Building. At least I deduce it was because the motto was 'Don't Panic' (see Daniel 4:34 because at that very hour the planets were in conjunction).This is followed by a lengthy ramble through the Bible, and the works of Adams, Castenada and Moorcock, which proves that 42 is really 666, the number of the beast, and concludes...Well, thanks for all the fish. A word from you might help matters with my girlfriend who doesn't seem to understand I actually lived through your books: If you don't understand this then I'll just give up (&#x201c;The Gods don't dwell amongst men&#x201d; Daniel 2:11)...Dear Mr Adams,I had a dream this morning that Jack Lemmon came up to me and asked directions to the Royal Albert Hall...Dear Douglas Adams,The Answer is not 42; it is 'NAM-MYOTO-RENGE-KYO'. This is the law of life as propounded by Nichiren Derishonin in about 1255 AD...Dear Douglas,What age will I be when mankind is born out of mother earth? I am now 34. Do you know Kit Williams's phone number?Happy Christmas and many of them. I reckon about eight by my digital watch.Love Muz.&#x201c;A number of people have said that Hitchhiker's belongs to the same genre as Pilgrim's Progress.&#x201c;That's not to compare the two, just to point out that there is a genre with a long history, which is that of the innocent abroad in a fantastical world.&#x201c;A graduate student sent me a long paper on one book that we know for sure that John Bunyan (author of Pilgrim's Progress) actually read. It's called The Plain Man's Path to Heaven, written by an English Puritan writer called Arthur Dent. He assumed that I was aware of this and was having some extraordinary academic joke.&#x201c;Once you've decided to find parallels you can find them all the time: you can add up numbers, you can compare images... you can pick up any two books and if you wished to prove they were parallel, you could do it. You could pick up the Bible and the telephone directory, and you could prove that each has a direct relationship to the other.&#x201d;- Douglas Adams.THE LAST WORD...Dear Mr Adams,You're weird. Or at least your writing is weird. That's okay by me. I'm a little weird myself. If you are really one of those terribly dull people who just write weird please keep it a secret, I hate being disillusioned...</p><h2>Values Clarification</h2><p>Are you getting what you want out of life?

In <i>In Defense of Troublemakers</i>, psychologist Charlan Nemeth argues that this principle is completely wrong: left unchallenged, the majority opinion is often biased, unoriginal, or false. It leads planes and markets to crash, causes juries to convict innocent people, and can quite literally make people think blue is green. In the name of comity, we embrace stupidity. We can make better decisions by embracing dissent. Dissent forces us to question the status quo, consider more information, and engage in creative decision-making.<br>From <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> to Edward Snowden, lone objectors who make people question their assumptions bring groups far closer to truth--regardless of whether they are right or wrong.

The concept of truth as absolute, objective and universal has undergone serious deterioration in recent years. No longer is it a goal for all to pursue. Rather postmodernism sees truth as inseparable from culture, psychology, race and gender. Ultimately, truth is what we make it to be. What factors have accelarated this decay of truth? Why are people willing to embrace such a devalued concept? How does this new view compare and contrast with a Christian understanding? While postmodernism contains some truthful insights (despite its attempt to dethrone truth), Douglas Groothuis sees its basic tenets as intellectually flawed and hostile to Christian views. In this spirited presentation of a solid, biblical and logical perspective, Groothuis unveils how truth has come under attack and how it can be defended in the vital areas of theology, apologetics, ethics and the arts.</p><p>Douglas R.

Their desecrated bodies get dumped by the roadside.</p> <p>Iraq in 2007? The Gaza Strip? Western Afghanistan?</p> <p>No. A place more dangerous: Canada in the 1600s. On rivers and in forests, Iroquois slaughter Huron and Europeans kill for land and power. It's a landscape of blood and horror whose viciousness eclipses the terrorism that shocks us today. Into this iniquitous land go dozens of stouthearted Jesuits, the purest examples of Roman Catholic virtue our Western continent has ever seen.</p> <p>Their purpose? To baptize souls and preach the gospel to savages whose degraded, vicious lives cry out for the light of Christ.</p> <p>Many of these Jesuits were murdered, and today eight of them are saints. Six were priests: Isaac Jogues, Jean de Br�beuf, Gabriel Lalemant, Antoine Daniel, Charles Garnier, and No�l Chabanel; two were lay assistants: Ren� Goupil and Jean Lalande.</p> <p>They are the Jesuit Martyrs of North America, and this is their story.</p> <p>From letters these brave men wrote to their superiors by the light of Indian campfires or while skimming lovely waters in swift canoes, John A. O'Brien has crafted the terrifying, inspiring, and true tale of the dangerous struggle they engaged in for enormous stakes: the salvation of countless souls mired in darkness.</p> <p>O'Brien shows that in the best of times, these good men were surrounded by lasciviousness, pandemonium and demonic rituals. Bad times brought bloody war, upraised tomahawks, the shrieks of victims, and knowledge that their superstitious hosts might turn against them without warning, and bury a tomahawk in their skull.</p> <p>Patient, charitable, and heedless of their own lives, these eight Jesuits spoke constantly of Jesus, baptized thousands, and even in the shadow of death brought them the consoling graces of the Sacraments. Between times they cared for souls dying of smallpox, cleaned festering wounds, and day in and day out returned love for hatred, blessings for curses, and prayers for abuse.</p> <p>Ultimately, all were murdered. Some died from a sudden blow; the rest were mutilated and tortured until, with forgiveness in their hearts and Jesus name on their lips, they died in flames their persecutors had set around them.</p> <p><em>Saints of the American Wilderness</em> tells of these good men who sought nothing less than the conversion of a continent. Their zeal won for them the imperishable crown of martyrdom and sanctified with their holy blood the soil of North America.</p> <p>Truly, they are models for those who would be saints in bloody times like ours.</p></p><p>Rev.

The blisters on your feet. The aching of your arms from practicing the skirtwork. The hours and hours rehearsing the same song until the music buries itself so deeply in your brain you hear it even in your sleep. The constant need to coax your body to move past the hurt, the frustration, the exhaustion, and convince it that it can do more . . .<br> <br>All that is worth this moment.<br> <br>To be up here onstage, bathed in the red, blue, and yellow stage lights. A thousand eyes look at you, admiring your flawless movements. Your feet seem to float over the floor as you twirl and twirl around and around before jumping into the arms of your partner.<br> <br>Applause erupts out of the darkness, and you close your eyes and listen to it, let it envelop you. It gives you strength. Three seconds to catch your breath before the next polka, &#x201c;El Circo,&#x201d; begins, and your heart beats hard against your chest, but you can&#x2019;t hear it above the sounds of the norte�o band playing upstage, the musician&#x2019;s fingers dance over the keys of his accordion as quickly as your feet stomp on the floor. As you and your partner move together, you feel the heat of his body, the intensity of his dancing. You look in his eyes and don&#x2019;t let him see that despite the adrenaline rushing through you, you&#x2019;re becoming more aware of the stabbing pain in your knee. You force yourself to keep smiling. He&#x2019;ll know for sure you lied&#x2014;to him, to yourself, thinking that you could perform like this.<br> <br>The stage is a flurry of dancers whirling and stomping. The audience breaks into a rhythmic clapping as they follow the lively song in 2/4 beat. On the fourth spin your knee buckles from under you and suddenly you&#x2019;re on the floor, the eleven other couples try not to step on you because after all, the dance must go on.<br> <br>You try to get up and continue, but your legs no longer obey. You stare at the audience, yet all you see is darkness. The Exit signs like evil red eyes mock you. How is this possible? How did it get to this point? Your partner scoops you up into his arms and whisks you off the stage. Despite the pulsing pain in your knee all you can think about is that you&#x2019;ve ruined the choreography. There will be a gap where there shouldn&#x2019;t be.<br> <br>The dancers waiting in the wings rush over, looking beautiful in their black Chiapas dresses embroidered with big colorful flowers. You want them to go away, to stop looking at you with pity. You&#x2019;re used to the awe, the admiration, the envy. But not their pity.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; they ask.<br> <br>You take a deep breath, trying to come up with something, anything except the truth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay, I&#x2019;m okay.

It has to.<br> Yesenia<p></p> <br>We&#x2019;ve just finished warm-ups and are now taking a short break before moving on to the Azteca danzas, but I&#x2019;m at the barre doing tendus. I need to believe warming up longer will help. That and Advil should help me get through practice, but lately that hasn&#x2019;t been the case. I feel my kneebones grinding against each other, and I&#x2019;ve started wearing a brace and keep it hidden under my sweatpants&#x2014;which I&#x2019;ve been using now instead of my Lycra pants&#x2014;and although the brace relieves some of the pressure, my right knee still stiffens and swells.<br> <br>My son, Memo, comes to stand by me and stretches as far as he can, yet his fingertips are two inches shy of his toes. It makes me feel better that at twenty, Memo isn&#x2019;t that much more flexible than I am.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m making chile verde for dinner,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Mom, I&#x2019;m going out with my friends tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you going on a Sunday night? Don&#x2019;t you have school tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To the Arclight. The director is going to be there for a Q and A after the movie. I&#x2019;ll come straight home afterward. Besides, my first class isn&#x2019;t until eleven.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can have the leftovers tomorrow, then. That is, if your father and I don&#x2019;t eat it all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Memo laughs and runs his fingers through his long hair. I brush it off his forehead, wishing he would cut it. He won&#x2019;t, though, no matter how much I complain that it doesn&#x2019;t look good onstage. The audience could think he&#x2019;s a girl dressed up in men&#x2019;s clothes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess what?&#x201d; Adriana, one of my dancers, says as she joins us at the barre. &#x201c;I got a job!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great!&#x201d; I say, suppressing a sigh of relief. Finally, Adriana will start paying her dues and stop begging her sister for rent money. &#x201c;How about I take you to La Perla to celebrate?&#x201d;<br> <br>My husband, Eduardo, picks up the atecocolli and brings it to his lips. When he blows into the shell the dancers peel themselves off the walls or get on their feet and head to the floor. &#x201c;Tomorrow after work, okay?&#x201d; I say to Adriana. As Eduardo pounds on his drum, the studio comes alive with movement. Memo remains by my side, and as we dance I can&#x2019;t help but remember the child he once was. Three years old, and already he had learned to do a zapateado. And now, he dances flawlessly. Gives in to the music of his ancestors, and when he turns to me and smiles, I feel a rush of pride. This tall young man is my little boy, whom I taught to walk, to dance, to love Folkl�rico.<br> <br>I look at the dancers around me. In the row in front of me is Stephanie, who at seventeen is the youngest in the professional group. In the row behind me is Olivia, who at thirty-six is the second-oldest dancer, six years younger than me. The women always leave. Start getting married. Having children. Pursuing a career. Little by little letting go of their passion for Folkl�rico.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been the co-director of my own dance group for nine years. Eduardo and I have worked so hard to get it where it is now. There are about a hundred Folkl�rico groups in Los Angeles, and Grupo Folkl�rico Alegr�a is one of the best. We have forty-five dancers, and in every one of our big shows there are always at least twelve couples on the stage.<br> <br>When we finish practicing the Azteca danzas, I put on my dance shoes and my red practice skirt, which is made of fourteen yards of poplin and falls right below my ankles. Lately, whenever it&#x2019;s my turn to teach I focus on the skirtwork even more than the footwork because it gives me a chance to rest my knee.<br> <br>&#x201c;You hold up your skirt like this,&#x201d; I say, standing before the female dancers, my back to the mirrors. &#x201c;Stop holding it as if it were a rag you clean your kitchen counter with! Veracruz is supposed to be danced with grace. You hold up the skirt delicately, as if it were sea foam, light in your hands. But your feet are fast, like the current.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though our next performance isn&#x2019;t one of our big shows but rather an adult school assembly, I won&#x2019;t let the dancers go until I&#x2019;m pleased with what I see. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the time to learn but to perfect,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Last year we gave an excellent show at this school and this year I want it to be even better.&#x201d;<br> <br>We do another run-through of the Veracruz Cuadro Eduardo and I choreographed, except I don&#x2019;t finish the suite. At the beginning of &#x201c;Coco,&#x201d; the last song of the cuadro, I step to the side and pretend my skirt has become loose. I wrap one strap around my waist, and then the other, slowly, breathing in and out. Eduardo glances at me, and so does Memo, the same worried look on their faces. I stand on the side and watch the dancers do the complex combination of steps. Sweating bodies flow in graceful rhythms, turning and turning, feet tapping faster and faster. I listen to the joyful music: the harp playing the melody, the jarana marking the rhythm, the requinto providing the counterpoint. To hell with my rebellious knee! I quickly pick up the sides of my skirt and join the dancers again. But by the end of the song, my feet hardly move. I do the skirt movements and hope no one can tell I&#x2019;m only marking the steps the way some of the lazy dancers do, the way Adriana is doing now. How often have I told her she must dance at practice the way she would dance onstage?<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t correct her today. How can I? My feet aren&#x2019;t as fast as the current anymore.<br> <br><br> <br>After practice I go home and head straight to the freezer; I sit on the recliner with an ice pack on my knee. Eduardo comes out of the shower with a towel wrapped around his waist. At forty-two he still has the body of a young dancer, slender and agile, so much like Memo&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ve always been jealous that he can eat anything he wants without gaining weight. Unlike me, who puts on pounds just by looking at food.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about you, Yessy,&#x201d; he says. He isn&#x2019;t a tall man; at five feet five he stands two inches shorter than me, and his thin body makes me feel like a beluga whale when standing next to him, but his deep, booming voice makes him seem larger than life. His poise conveys confidence, power. That&#x2019;s what attracted me to him the first time we met when we were kids. He isn&#x2019;t a good-looking man, but the way he carries himself always makes women turn to look in admiration.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine, you&#x2019;ll see. It&#x2019;s nothing to worry about,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve let it go on for too long now. It could get worse.&#x201d; He comes to stand behind me and massages my neck. &#x201c;Dancing isn&#x2019;t forever. When our time comes, we have to let it go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you talking about? I&#x2019;m not ready to let it go. This will pass. It always does.&#x201d; I stand up and put the ice pack back in the freezer and begin preparations for a lonely dinner without Memo.<br> <br><br> <br>After a shower I tuck myself under the blankets and wrap my arms around Eduardo. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; I confess. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s happening to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He squeezes my hand and says, &#x201c;I know, honey. I know. But you have to do something about it, Yessy. If you keep pushing yourself the way you&#x2019;ve been doing, it could get worse.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be that bad, can it? Maybe if I take it easy these next few days . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to see a doctor. Even though the pain does go away, it always comes back&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s worse.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn around to face the wall and sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;No matter what happens, you&#x2019;ll always have Alegr�a,&#x201d; Eduardo says. &#x201c;The group will always be yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>I dreamed of starting my own group for a long time. When Memo was in sixth grade, Eduardo and I finally got serious about it and began to look for a studio to rent. Eduardo had just inherited his father&#x2019;s electrical business and didn&#x2019;t have much time for the group. Teaching and choreographing was all he could do, so I devoted myself to recruiting dancers, acquiring the costumes, looking for performance venues, hiring the musicians. I spent day after day writing grant proposals to get funding. Before finally forming a committee and assigning responsibilities to some of the other dancers, I was the one who spent countless hours on the phone trying to book performances, receiving the dancers&#x2019; dues, making deposits, paying the rent for the studio, worrying about the constant shortage of money. Grupo Folkl�rico Alegr�a is mine as much as it is his.<br> <br>I sigh in the darkness, trying to fight the nostalgia that lately has been visiting me at night. I get out of bed, careful not to wake him. Eduardo can fall asleep within minutes, whereas I have a hard time getting my mind to stop thinking. As I make my way to the kitchen to get a drink of water I notice the light seeping through the crack under Memo&#x2019;s door. I wonder if he had a good time tonight, but just as I&#x2019;m about to knock I hear him talking on the phone, laughing once in a while. He&#x2019;s graduating from Pasadena City College in a few months, and in August he&#x2019;s moving to Riverside before the school year starts at UCR. I move away from his bedroom door. As I walk down the dark hallway, I try not to think about life without Memo at home.<br> <br><br> <br>Mondays at the AAA office are usually busy. By the time lunchtime comes around I&#x2019;ve sold three new auto policies and five memberships. As I&#x2019;m getting ready to finally take my lunch break, a client comes into the office. From the corner of my eye I see him checking in at the front. I want to rush out the door and later claim I didn&#x2019;t see him. But his name appears on my computer screen, and I have no choice but to get up and call him to my cubicle. He walks toward me with determined steps, and I notice that his right arm ends right above the elbow in a stump.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, my name is Yesenia.&#x201d; I awkwardly shake his left hand and offer him a seat. I sit at my computer and say, &#x201c;How can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to get a quote for car insurance.&#x201d;<br> <br>I ask him a series of questions that will help me determine his premium. I try not to glance at the stump and hope he can&#x2019;t see the disgust I feel. He should at least wear long-sleeve shirts to hide it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does it bother you?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, of course not.&#x201d;<br> <br>He chuckles. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay; I&#x2019;m used to it by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Were you in a bad accident?&#x201d; I try to keep my eyes on my computer.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, actually, I was bitten by a cat.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn to look at him. &#x201c;You serious?&#x201d; I was imagining different scenarios; maybe he lost his arm in the war or performing some heroic deed, like Antonio Banderas trying to save Salma Hayek in that movie about a mariachi.<br> <br>As I write his policy he tells me what happened&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to the bite, cleaning it with hydrogen peroxide, thinking the infection would go away, but it kept getting worse. Soon, his arm was so swollen he couldn&#x2019;t put it off any longer and went to see the doctor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you go sooner?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I thought a cat&#x2019;s bite was no big deal,&#x201d; he says. He&#x2019;d been hurt worse before. Stepped on a rusty nail once when he was walking around his yard barefoot, and nothing happened to him then, although his wife kept telling him he might get tetanus. So what was a bite of a stray cat going to do to him?<br> <br>&#x201c;The doctor said a cat&#x2019;s bite is much worse than a dog&#x2019;s bite,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Cats have a lot of bacteria in their mouths because they&#x2019;re constantly licking themselves, even their butts. So the bacteria had spread so much there was nothing he could do but cut off my arm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what the worst part is?&#x201d; he asks. I shake my head. &#x201c;Sometimes I wake up and reach for my glasses, thinking my arm is still whole. And I see this instead . . .&#x201d; He lifts up his arm so that I can see the stump up close.<br> <br><br> <br>I pick up Adriana after work and we head to El Mercadito in East L.A.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long was it this time?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three months, two weeks, and three days,&#x201d; she says as she lowers the window.

Yet Brockman, in telling her story, is also perceptively candid in showing how Mormonism, even at its best, is incapable of truly reconciling a person to themselves, their neighbor, or their God. As she herself experienced, only Jesus can heal our hurt and dysfunction.

Khrushchev&#39;s speech was a body blow from which the worldwide communist movement never recovered. It changed the course of history. Grover Furr has spent a decade studying the flood of documents from formerly secret Soviet archives published since the end of the USSR. In this detailed study of Khrushchev&#39;s speech he reveals the astonishing results of his research: Not a single one of Khrushchev&#39;s &#34;revelations&#34; is true! The most influential speech of the 20th century - if not of all time - a dishonest swindle? The very thought is monstrous; the implications for our understanding of Left history-immense. Basing their work on Khrushchev&#39;s lies, Soviet and Western historians, including Trotskyists and anticommunists, have effectively falsified Soviet history.

Reprint.</p><p>David Weber's Honor Harrington series continues in this 10th novel, which picks up the action several years after the previous volume, <i>Ashes of Victory</i>. With a ceasefire in place with the Peeps, the new government of the Star Kingdom ignores the wishes of Queen Elizabeth and then threatens the very fabric of the Manticore Alliance against the People's Republic of Haven. We find Honor in the role of a senior political advisor, performing with her usual flair and �lan. <p> With <i>War of Honor</i> coming in at over 800 pages, Weber has room to expand subplots and secondary characters and bring to the reader a feeling of depth and completeness seldom seen in science fiction novels. Favorite characters from past stories return, many of them growing in stature from unimportant secondary characters to major players in the "Honorverse." Weber serves up trouble in Silesia, the excitement of a new wormhole junction, scheming in Manticorian politics, strange events deep in Peep territory, and plenty of exploding spaceships--and, as publisher Jim Baen says, "We like exploding spaceships." <i>--Ron Peterson</i></p>Undeniably the science fiction phenomenon of the decade, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author <b>David Weber</b> is often compared to C.S. Forester (the celebrated creator of Captain Horatio Hornblower) and is the recipient of critical praise worthy of Heinlein or Asimov. His hordes of voracious fans clamor for more and more Weber. Fortunately for them, Weber keeps steadily producing book after book. His novels range from epic fantasy (<i>Oath of Swords, The War God's Own</i>) to breathtaking space opera (<i>Path of the Fury, The Armageddon Inheritance</i>) to military science fiction with in-depth characterization (the celebrated and awesomely popular Honor Harrington series, <i>Ashes of Victory</i> being the last installment). Reviewers call Weber "highly entertaining" (<i>Booklist</i>), "outstanding...superb...excellent" (<i>Wilson Library Bulletin</i>), "remarkable" (<i>Kliatt</i>), "the best" (<i>Dragon</i>), "worth shouting about" (<i>Philadelphia Weekly Press</i>), "great" (<i>Locus</i>), and "the best writer around today" (<i>FosFax</i>).

Growing up amid famine and poverty in rural Malawi, wind was one of the few abundant resources available, and the inventive fourteen-year-old saw its energy as a way to power his dreams. "With a windmill, we'd finally release ourselves from the troubles of darkness and hunger," he realized. "A windmill meant more than just power, it was freedom." Despite the biting jeers of village skeptics, young William devoted himself to borrowed textbooks and salvage yards in pursuit of a device that could produce an "electric wind." <i>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind</i> is an inspiring story of an indomitable will that refused to bend to doubt or circumstance.

They also take account of the recent Dominican electoral processes, the colossal and fraudulent banking crisis of 2002-2004, and the perpetuation of corruption as part of Dominican political culture.</p><p>FRANK MOYA PONS is the foremost expert on Dominican history and the author of more than twenty scholarly books and numerous articles.Review of the first edition: &#34;Frank Moya Pons is the best-known contemporary Dominican historian. The author of many books and articles, he is a recognized scholar both at home and abroad. Moya Pons latest book is based on his well-known Manual de historia dominicana (1992), now in its tenth edition and considered a basic text in Dominican historiography. But his new book is more than a simple translation of the old classic; it is a revised and expanded edition, with new sections, detailed historical maps, and a comprehensive bibliographic essay. The book follows two parallel historical tracks. On the one hand, it is divided into thematic chapters that examine the distinct political periods in the country&#39;s history, such as the Spanish, French, Haitian, and U.S. occupations and the several periods of self-rule. On the other hand, it pursues a socioeconomic history by establishing links, when pertinent, between socioeconomic conditions and political developments. Another notable feature of the book is that it examines contemporary events up to 1990. This remains the standard Dominican history textbook, in both English and Spanish. The general reader will find in this book an agreeable, clearly written history of the Dominican Republic, while the experienced scholar will find an indispensable reference.&#34; -HAHR (Hispanic-American Historical Review) --Hispanic American Historical Review</p><h2>Heart of Texas Volume 2: An Anthology</h2><p><br><br><em>Welcome to the town of Promise, deep in the heart of Texas!</em><br><br>Promise, a ranching community in the Hill Country, is a place with a mysterious past and a secret or two hidden under its everyday exterior.

He glanced distractedly at the row of mailboxes, gathering his courage before he approached Caroline Daniels, the postmistress.<br><br>His tongue felt as if it'd wrapped itself around his front teeth, and he was beginning to doubt he'd be able to utter a single sensible word. It shouldn't be so damned difficult to let a woman know he found her attractive!<br><br>"Grady?" Caroline's voice reached out to him.<br><br>He spun around, not seeing her. Great. Not only was he dreaming about her, now he was hearing her voice.<br><br>"Open your box," she instructed.<br><br>He fumbled for the key and twisted open the small rectangular door, then peered in. Sure enough, Caroline was there. Not all of her, just her brown eyes, her pert little nose and lovely mouth.<br><br>If he'd possessed his brother's gift for flattery, Grady would have said something clever. Made some flowery remark. Unfortunately all he managed was a gruff unfriendly sounding "Hello."<br><br>"Hi."<br><br>Caroline had beautiful eyes, dark and rich like freshly brewed coffee, which was about as poetic as Grady got. Large and limpid, they reminded him of a calf's, but he figured that might not be something a woman wanted to hear, even if <em>he</em> considered it a compliment. This was the problem, Grady decided. He didn't know how to talk to a woman. In fact, it'd been more than six years since he'd gone out on an actual date.<br><br>"Can I help you with anything?" she asked.<br><br>He wanted to invite her to lunch, and although that seemed a simple enough request, he couldn't make himself ask her. Probably because their relationship so far hadn't been too promising. Calling it a "relationship" wasn't really accurate, since they'd barely exchanged a civil word and had never so much as held hands. Mostly they snapped at each other, disagreed and argued&#x2014;if they were speaking at all. True, they'd danced once; it'd been nice, but only when he could stop worrying about stepping on her toes.<br><br>Who was he kidding? Holding Caroline in his arms had been more than nice, it had been <em>wonderful.</em> In the month since, he hadn't been able to stop thinking about that one dance. Every night when he climbed into bed and closed his eyes, Caroline was there to greet him. He could still feel her softness against him, could almost smell the faint scent of her cologne. The dance had been ladies' choice, and that was enough to let him believe&#x2014;hope&#x2014;she might actually hold some regard for him, too. Despite their disagreements, <em>he'd</em> been the one she'd chosen to ask.<br><br>"You had lunch yet?" Grady asked, his voice brusque. He didn't mean to sound angry or unfriendly. The timbre of his voice and his abrupt way of speaking had caused him plenty of problems with Maggie, Caroline's five-year-old daughter. He'd been trying to get in the kid's good graces for months now, with only limited success. But he'd tried. He hoped Caroline and Maggie gave him credit for that.<br><br>Caroline's mouth broke into a wide grin. "Lunch? Not yet, and I'm starved."<br><br>Grady's spirits lifted considerably. "Well, then, I was thinking, seeing as I haven't eaten myself.." The words stumbled all over themselves in his eagerness to get them out. "You want to join me?"<br><br>"Sure, but let me get this straight. Is this an invitation, as in a date?"<br><br>"No." His response was instinctive, given without thought. He'd been denying his feelings for her so long that his answer had come automatically. He feared, too, that she might misread his intentions. He was attracted to Caroline and he wanted to know her better, but beyond that&#x2014;he wasn't sure. Hell, what he knew about love and marriage wouldn't fill a one-inch column of the <em>Promise Gazette.</em><br><br>Some of the happiness faded from her smile. "Understood. Give me a few minutes and I'll meet you out front." She moved out of his range of vision.<br><br>Grady closed the box, but left his hand on the key. How could anyone with the skills to run a thriving cattle ranch in the Texas Hill Country be such a fool when it came to women?<br><br>He rapped on the post-office box hard enough to hurt his knuckles. "Caroline!" Then he realized he had to open the box. He did that, then stared through it and shouted for her a second time. "Caroline!"<br><br>Her face appeared, eyes snapping with impatience. "What's the rush?" she demanded. "I said it'd take me a few minutes."<br><br>The edges of the postbox cut into his forehead and chin and knocked his Stetson askew. "This <em>is</em> a date, all right?"<br><br>She stared back at him from the other side, and either she was overwhelmed by his offer to buy her lunch or surprised into speechlessness.<br><br>"All right?" he repeated. "This is a date."<br><br>She continued to look at him. "I shouldn't have asked," she finally said.<br><br>"I'm glad you did." And he was. He could think of no better way to set things straight. He hadn't invited her to lunch because he needed someone to pass the time with; if that was what he'd wanted, he could have asked his sister, Savannah, or her husband or Cal Patterson&#x2014;or any number of people. No, he'd asked Caroline because he wanted to be with <em>her.</em> For once he longed to talk to her without interference or advice from his matchmaking sister. It didn't help to have Maggie there hiding her face in her mother's lap every time he walked into the room, either. This afternoon it'd be just the two of them. Caroline and him.<br><br>Grady respectfully removed his hat when she joined him in the lobby.<br><br>"This is a pleasant surprise," Caroline said.<br><br>"I was in town, anyway." He didn't mention that he'd rearranged his entire day for this opportunity. It was hard enough admitting that to himself, let alone Caroline.<br><br>"Where would you like to eat?" he asked. The town had three good restaurants: the cafe in the bowling alley; the Chili Pepper, a Texas barbecue place; and a Mexican restaurant run by the Chavez family.<br><br>"How about Mexican Lindo?" Caroline suggested.<br><br>It was the one he would have chosen himself. "Great."<br><br>Since the restaurant was on Fourth Avenue, only two blocks from the post office, they walked there, chatting as they went. Or rather, Caroline chatted and he responded with grunts and murmurs.<br><br>Grady had long ago realized he lacked the ability to make small talk. Unlike his younger brother, Richard, who could charm his way into&#x2014;or out of&#x2014;anything. Grady tried not to feel inadequate, but he was distinctly relieved when they got to the restaurant.<br><br>In a few minutes they were seated at a table, served water and a bowl of tortilla chips along with a dish of extra-hot salsa. He reached for a chip, scooped up as much salsa as it would hold and popped it in his mouth. He ate another and then another before he noticed that Caroline hadn't touched a single chip.<br><br>He raised his eyes to hers and stopped chewing, his mouth full.<br><br>Caroline apparently read the question in his eyes. "I don't eat corn chips," she explained. "I fill up on them and then I don't have room for anything else."<br><br>He swallowed and nodded. "Oh."<br><br>A moment of silence passed, and Grady wondered if her comment was a subtle hint that she was watching her weight. From what he understood, weight was a major preoccupation with women. Maybe she was waiting for him to tell her she shouldn't worry about it; maybe he was supposed to say she looked great. She did. She was slender and well proportioned, and she wore her dark brown hair straight and loose, falling to her shoulders. In his opinion she looked about as perfect as a woman could get. Someday he'd tell her that, but not just yet. Besides, he didn't want her to think he was only interested in her body, although it intrigued him plenty. He admired a great deal about her, especially the way she was raising Maggie on her own. She understood the meaning of the words <em>responsibility</em> and <em>sacrifice,</em> just like he did.<br><br>She was staring at him as if she expected a comment, and Grady realized he needed to say something. "You could be fat and I'd still have asked you to lunch."<br><br>Her smooth brow crumpled in a puzzled frown.<br><br>"I meant that as a compliment," he sputtered and decided then and there it was better to keep his trap shut. Thankfully the waitress came to take their order. Grady decided on chicken enchiladas; Caroline echoed his choice.<br><br>"This is really very nice," she said and reached for the tall glass of iced tea.<br><br>"I wanted us to have some time alone," he told her. "Any particular reason?"<br><br>Grady rested his spine against the back of his chair and boldly met her look. "I like you, Caroline." He didn't know any way to be other than direct. This had gotten him into difficulties over the years. Earlier that spring he'd taken a dislike to Laredo Smith and hadn't been shy about letting his sister and everyone else know his feelings. But he'd been wrong in his assessment of the man's character. Smith's truck had broken down and Savannah had brought him home to the ranch. Over Grady's objections she'd hired him herself, and before long they'd fallen in love. It came as a shock to watch his sane sensible sister give her heart to a perfect stranger. Still, Grady wasn't proud of the way he'd behaved. By the time Laredo decided it'd be better for everyone concerned if he moved on, Grady had wanted him to stay. He'd gone so far as to offer the man a partnership in the ranch in an effort to change his mind. Not that it'd done any good. To Grady's eternal gratitude, Laredo had experienced a change of heart and returned a couple of months later. Love had driven him away, but it had also brought him back.<br><br>Savannah and Laredo had married in short order and were now involved in designing plans for their own home, plus raising quarter horses. Savannah, with her husband's active support, continued to grow the antique roses that were making her a name across the state.<br><br>In the weeks since becoming his brother-in-law, Laredo Smith had proved himself a damn good friend and Grady's right-hand man.<br><br>"I like you, too," Caroline said, but she lowered her gaze as she spoke, breaking eye contact. This seemed to be something of an admission for them both.<br><br>"You do?" Grady felt light-headed with joy. It was all he could do not to leap in the air and click his heels.<br><br>"We've known each other a lot of years."<br><br>"I've known you most of my life," he agreed, but as he said the words, he realized he didn't <em>really</em> know Caroline. Not the way he wanted, not the way he hoped he would one day. It wasn't just that he had no idea who'd fathered Maggie; apparently no one else in town did, either. He wondered what had attracted her to this man, why she hadn't married him. Or why he'd left her to deal with the pregnancy and birth alone. It all remained a mystery. Another thing Grady didn't understand about Caroline was the changes in her since her daughter's birth. In time Grady believed she'd trust him enough to answer his questions, and he prayed he'd say and do the right thing when she did.<br><br>Their lunches arrived and they ate, stopping to chat now and then. The conversation didn't pall, but again he had to credit Caroline with the skill to keep it going. Half an hour later, as he escorted her back to the post office, Grady was walking on air.<br><br>"I'll give you a call tomorrow," he said, watching her for some sign of encouragement. "If you want," he added, needing her reassurance.<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>Her response was neither encouraging nor discouraging.<br><br>"I'd like to talk to Maggie again, if she'll let me."<br><br>"You might try this afternoon, since she's spending the day with Savannah."<br><br>This was news to Grady, but he'd been busy that morning and had left the house early. He hadn't spoken to Savannah other than a few words over breakfast, and even if he'd known Maggie was staying with his sister, he wouldn't have had time to chat with the girl that morning.<br><br>"I'll make a point of saying hello," he said. His heart lifted when it suddenly struck him that he'd be seeing Caroline again later in the day, when she came to pick up Maggie.<br><br>They parted. Whistling, Grady sauntered across the asphalt parking lot toward his truck. He felt damn good. The afternoon had gone better than he'd hoped.<br><br>He was about to open the cab door when Max Jordan stopped him.<br><br>"Grady, have you got a moment?" The older man, owner of the local Western-wear store, quickened his pace.<br><br>"Howdy, Max." Grady grinned from ear to ear and didn't let the somber expression on Max's face get him down. "What can I do for you?"<br><br>Max shuffled his feet a couple of times, looking uncomfortable. "You know I hate to mention this a second time, but Richard still hasn't paid me for the clothes he bought three months ago."<br><br>The happy excitement Grady had experienced only moments earlier died a quick death. "It was my understanding Richard mailed you a check."<br><br>"He told me the same thing, but it's been more than two weeks now and nothing's come. I don't feel I should have to wait any longer."<br><br>"I don't think you should, either. I'll speak to him myself," Grady promised.<br><br>"I hate to drag you into this," Max muttered, and it was clear from his shaky voice how much the subject distressed him.<br><br>"Don't worry about it, Max. I understand."<br><br>The older man nodded and turned away. Grady climbed into his truck and clenched the steering wheel with both hands as the anger flooded through him. Leave it to his brother to lie and cheat and steal!<br><br>What infuriated Grady was that he had no one to blame but himself. He'd allowed Richard to continue living on the Yellow Rose. Allowed him to tarnish the family name. Allowed himself to believe, to hope, that the years away had changed his brother.<br><br>All his illusions had been shattered. They were destroyed like so much else Richard had touched. He'd done his damnedest to ruin Grady, and he'd come close. But Richard had succeeded in ruining his own life&#x2014;his potential to be a different person, a worthwhile human being.<br><br>Charming and personable, a born leader, Richard could have accomplished great things. Instead, he'd used his charisma and personality to swindle others, never understanding that the person he'd cheated most had been himself.<br><br>Six years earlier Richard had forged Grady's signature and absconded with the cash their parents had left&#x2014;cash that would have paid the inheritance taxes on the ranch and covered the burial expenses. Grady and Savannah had found themselves penniless following the tragedy that had claimed their parents' lives. It'd taken six long, backbreaking, frustration-filled years to crawl out of debt. Grady had sacrificed those years to hold on to the ranch while Richard had squandered the money. When it had run out, he'd returned home with his tail between his legs, looking for a place to stay until he received a severance check from his last job&#x2014;or so he'd said.<br><br>Deep down Grady had wanted to believe in Richard. His sister had begged him to let their younger brother stay. But she didn't need to beg very hard or very long for him to relent. Unfortunately it had become apparent that a liar and a cheat didn't change overnight&#x2014;or in six years. Grady's brother was the same now as the day he'd stolen from his family.<br><br>Despite the air conditioner, the heat inside the truck cab sucked away Grady's energy. It should have come as no surprise to discover that Richard had lied to him again. This time would be the last, Grady vowed. Oh, yes, this episode was the proverbial last straw.<br><br></p><h2>Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt</h2><p><b>An inspiring tale of creativity and determination on the Underground Railroad from Coretta Scott King winner James Ransome and acclaimed author Deborah Hopkinson.</b><br><br>Clara, a slave and seamstress on Home Plantation, dreams of freedom--not just for herself, but for her family and friends.

At its best, worry helps us reflect on and solve a problem. But for many, worry creates a negative cycle of unnecessary suffering. Now, based on cutting-edge research and proven clinical techniques, Dr. Martin Rossman has developed a program to help you harness the healing power of the mind to invigorate the emotional and intuitive parts of your brain and enhance your problem-solving abilities. You&#x2019;ll learn to:<br>&nbsp;<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify worries you can &#x2013; and can&#x2019;t &#x2013; control.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultivate the part of your brain that helps you solve problems more creatively.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hardwire&#x201d; yourself for calmness and clarity with guided imagery.<br><br>Grounded in breakthrough research and wonderfully accessible, <i>The Worry Solution</i> is a powerful and practical guide to living your best life &#x2013; healthier, happier, and free from unnecessary stress.</p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Author Martin Rossman, M.D.</b> <br> <p></p> <b>Is worry always bad for you?</b><br> No, that&#x2019;s the point of <i>The Worry Solution</i>. &#x201c;Good&#x201d; worry can help you solve problems and avoid danger. It&#x2019;s just when you let it become a bad habit that it becomes a problem. <p></p> <b>Do women worry more than men? If so, why?</b><br> All studies show that women worry more than men. Why? Probably because they have more to worry about&#x2014;including men! Biologically speaking, with women generally being smaller, slower, and physically weaker than men, it makes sense for them to be more vigilant and careful, especially to signs of violence and aggression. Brain studies show that the areas in the brain that process fear and vigilance are considerably larger in women, and I have to assume that was in the survival interest for them and their young. Now, with so much frightening information coming to us through the media, everyone, women especially, need to upgrade their mental software so as to be able to focus on using worry well. <p></p> <b>How can we develop a good worry habit if we are living with very real worries&#x2014;like facing eviction or not having health care, or having family in a war-torn country?</b><br> Unfortunately, <i>The Worry Solution</i> cannot remove real tragedy and hardship from life. But it can eliminate a great deal of tragedy and hardship that never actually happens. The essence of <i>The Worry Solution</i> is separating things into those you can do something about from those you can&#x2019;t, and learning how to deal better with both. It doesn&#x2019;t mean life is easy, but it can help us avoid making life harder than it needs to be. <p></p> <b>Can you explain why guided imagery is so effective in reducing worry and anxiety? </b><br> Imagery-based thinking shifts our attention out of the ruts of worry we may have inadvertently created and immediately shows us that we can have choices about what we experience. It is also the most direct and potent way to connect with our ability to relax, access our own wisdom, and solve problems creatively. Imagery can transform worry from a bad habit to a powerful tool for living. <p></p> <b>Using the techniques outlined in this book, how soon would someone see a difference in their worrying habits? </b><br> If people haven&#x2019;t ever experienced a way to consciously relax their bodies and minds, they often feel better immediately after doing that! Just knowing that whether you are consumed by worry or have other options is very freeing and changes the way people think. To change a habit, though, takes practice and repetition. Someone with a bad worry habit might need three to six weeks to develop a better way to use their ability to worry. <p></p> <b>How do people know when they need medication for their worry and when they can use guided imagery alone?</b><br> There are traumatic times when fear goes beyond worry and it can take over our minds&#x2014;creating panic and high levels of anxiety. When the brain is aroused that way, it may take medications to get the anxiety level down to where people can regain control of their faculties. <p></p> But when the worry is chronic and habitual, it is wise to learn the skills taught in <i>The Worry Solution</i> and see what they can do for you. Many people find that gets them back in control of themselves and they don&#x2019;t need medications. <p></p><p>MARTIN ROSSMAN, M.D., is a clinical instructor&nbsp; at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical School, the founder of www.thehealingmind.org, and the author of <i>Fighting Cancer from Within</i> and <i>Guided Imagery for Self-Healing</i>.

What is the essential quality that makes coaches and leaders more resilient, resourceful, and authentic?Presence-Based Coaching offers coaches a hands-on resource for developing the capacities and skills needed to be reliably present in all situations, and shows how to let go of habitual&#x2014;and often ineffective&#x2014;ways of responding. As author and leadership expert Doug Silsbee explains, once a coach has mastered the inner moves of directing their own attention, they can work to develop the same capability in their clients. The ability of a coach to facilitate lasting, sustainable development in leaders rests on the presence a coach offers to the coach-client relationship.This groundbreaking and practical book shows coaches specifically how to develop the quality of presence within themselves and how to enhance their coaching by cultivating it in others. Silsbee examines presence as an essential element in human learning and development and maps out a comprehensive approach to accelerating and deepening the development process. Step by step, he provides concrete and practical tools for building presence, and includes the tools for accessing and using presence in order to coach leaders to become whole, authentic, and self-generative.Filled with illustrative examples and tested practices organized around mind, body, and heart, Presence-Based Coaching helps to cultivate the capacity to be fully alive, resourceful, and connected to ourselves, our people, and our environment.</p></p><h2>Philosophical Devices: Proofs, Probabilities, Possibilities, and Sets</h2><p>This book is designed to explain the technical ideas that are taken for granted in much contemporary philosophical writing. Notions like "denumerability," "modal scope distinction," "Bayesian conditionalization," and "logical completeness" are usually only elucidated deep within difficult specialist texts. By offering simple explanations that by-pass much irrelevant and boring detail, <em>Philosophical Devices</em> is able to cover a wealth of material that is normally only available to specialists. <br><br>The book contains four sections, each of three chapters. The first section is about sets and numbers, starting with the membership relation and ending with the generalized continuum hypothesis. The second is about analyticity, a prioricity, and necessity. The third is about probability, outlining the difference between objective and subjective probability and exploring aspects of conditionalization and correlation. The fourth deals with metalogic, focusing on the contrast between syntax and semantics, and finishing with a sketch of Godel's theorem. <br><br><em>Philosophical Devices</em> will be useful for university students who have got past the foothills of philosophy and are starting to read more widely, but it does not assume any prior expertise. All the issues discussed are intrinsically interesting, and often downright fascinating. It can be read with pleasure and profit by anybody who is curious about the technical infrastructure of contemporary philosophy.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Papineau</strong> was educated in Trinidad, England, and South Africa.

Patients with NES frequently present in neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and emergency departments. The disorder has been documented in the medical literature for centuries, and much is known about the phenomenology, seizure characteristics, psychiatric comorbidities, neuropsychological testing, and psychosocial aspects in NES. However, until recently, much less was known about the effective treatments of patients with psychogenic NES. <br><br>This intervention provides guidance for clinicians in treating patients with NES and is designed to be used in conjunction with the patient workbook, <em>Taking Control of Your Seizures</em>. Session by session, the <em>Workbook</em> facilitates communication between treatment providers and individual patients with seizures.

Around 40 percent of the world's people live under some form of authoritarian rule, and authoritarian regimes govern about a third of the world's countries.<br><br>In <em>Authoritarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know</em>�, Erica Frantz guides us through today's authoritarian wave, explaining how it came to be and what its features are. She also looks at authoritarians themselves, focusing in particular on the techniques they use to take power, the strategies they use to survive, and how they fall. Understanding how politics works in authoritarian regimes and recognizing the factors that either give rise to them or trigger their downfall is ever-more important given current global trends, and this book paves the ways for such an understanding.<br><br>An essential primer on the topic, <em>Authoritarianism </em>provides <em>a</em> clear and penetrating overview of one of the most important-and worrying-developments in contemporary world politics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Erica Frantz </strong>is Assistant Professor in the Political Science Department at Michigan State University. She specializes in authoritarian politics, with a focus on democratization, conflict, and development. Frantz is also interested in the security and policy implications of authoritarian rule. She has written four books on dictatorships and development, and her work has appeared in multiple academic and policy-oriented journals.<br></p><h2>The Birth of the Trinity: Jesus, God, and Spirit in New Testament and Early Christian Interpretations of the Old Testament</h2><p>How and when did Jesus and the Spirit come to be regarded as fully God? <em>The Birth of the Trinity</em> offers a new historical approach by exploring the way in which first- and second-century Christians read the Old Testament in order to differentiate the one God as multiple persons. The earliest Christians felt they could metaphorically 'overhear' divine conversations between Father, Son, and Spirit when reading the Old Testament. When these snatches of dialogue are connected and joined, they form a narrative about the unfolding interior divine life as understood by the nascent church. What emerges is not a static portrait of the triune God, but a developing story of divine persons enacting mutual esteem, voiced praise, collaborative strategy, and self-sacrificial love. The presence of divine dialogue in the New Testament and early Christian literature shows that, contrary to the claims of James Dunn and Bart Ehrman (among others), the earliest Christology was the highest Christology, as Jesus was identified as a divine person through Old Testament interpretation.<br></p><p><b>Matthew W. Bates </b>(Ph.D., The University of Notre Dame) is Assistant Professor of Theology at Quincy University in Quincy, Illinois."It is not every day that one reads a book that makes a distinct contribution to our understanding of how the NT authors interpret the OT, sheds significant light on the reading practices of the NT authors by means of the early church fathers, and uses those results to make a compelling argument for the origins of the doctrine of the Trinity. But this is exactly what Bates does in <em>The Birth of the Trinity...The Birth of the Trinity</em> is a stunning achievement that makes a powerful argument for the origins of the doctrine of the Trinity by means of close attention to the reading practices of the early church and the NT authors."--<em>Themelios<br><br></em>"<em>The Birth of the Trinity</em> is a stunningly important book that defies easy categorization. Is it exegetical? Is it theological? Is it historical? The resounding answer to each of these questions: 'Yes, and much more!' Setting aside widespread and long-held views about Christological development or adoptionism, or about Trinitarian theology as an intrusion into biblical faith from Hellenistic philosophy, Bates urges that early high Christology and Christian understanding of the Trinity itself were cultivated through dramatic reading of Israel's Scriptures. For biblical and theological studies alike, this is a compelling game changer." --Joel B. Green, Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"This is a bold and ambitious book that cuts across disciplinary lines as typically perceived, and will certainly (and reasonably) generate debate on a number of the points argued in it. But Bates makes an important contribution in underscoring how early Christians perceived the voice and person of Jesus in their ('Old Testament') scriptures, and in contending that this constituted an important mode of theological reflection along the route to the doctrine of the Trinity." --Larry W. Hurtado, Emeritus Professor of New Testament Language, Literature &amp; Theology, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"In this fascinating new study Matthew W. Bates mines a stream of early Trinitarian thinking that has all too often been forgotten. Of particular importance is his attention to the continuities between the New Testament writers own ways of attending to the divine agents at which Israel's Scriptures already hinted, and also to the modes of Trinitarian exegesis that remained central throughout the early Christian period." --Lewis Ayres, Professor of Catholic and Historical Theology, Durham University<br><br>"In this bold and erudite study, Matthew W. Bates argues that it was not least by reading the Scriptures (the 'Old Testament') theodramatically, or prosopologically, that Jesus and his followers came very early on to Trinitarian conclusions. Scholars and students will find here a new and exciting way of investigating Christian origins. A landmark book." --Matthew Levering, Perry Family Foundation Professor of Theology, Mundelein Seminary <br><br>"On the dust jacket Joel Green calls this book a 'game changer', and it certainly is that." --<em>Heythrop Journal</em> <br><br>"Ambitious." --<em>Expository Times<br><br></em>"Whatever the final verdict on Bates's overall claims about the role of prosopological exegesis in the development of Trinitarian theology, his approach opens up beautiful, rich Trinitarian readings." --<em>First Things</em> <br><br>"...[A] fresh approach to Christian trinitarian interpretation..." --<em>Euangelion Blog, via Patheos</em></p><h2>Discovering Research Methods in Psychology: A Student&#39;s Guide</h2><p><i>Discovering Research Methods in Psychology: A Student's Guide</i> presents an accessible introduction to the research methodology techniques that underpin the field of psychology <ul> <li>Offers a unique narrative approach to introducing the complexities of psychological research methods to first year students</li> <li>Introduces the reader to the three main types of research methods used in psychology &#x2013; observation, experimentation and survey methods</li> <li>Provides clear summaries of 21st-century published studies that reflect diversity and best illustrate issues in research methodology</li> <li>Includes an emphasis on topics of most interest to students,&nbsp;from those with a personal perspective such as&nbsp;romantic relationships, prejudice and career decisions, to clinical topics including eating disorders, heavy drinking and&nbsp;paranoia&nbsp;</li> <li>Features a comprehensive glossary of all research terminology used in the narrative</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><i>Discovering Research Methods in Psychology</i> presents an accessible, student-friendly introduction to the principal research methodology techniques that underpin the field of psychology.

This book critically examines the best biblical and historical scholarship before tackling head-on some of the key questions of systematic Christology: does orthodox faith present Jesus the man as deficient and depersonalized? Is his sinlessness compatible with the exercise of a free human will? Does up-to-date exegesis challenge his virginal conception and personal resurrection? Can one reconcile Jesus&#39; role as universal Saviour with the truth and values to be found in other religions? What should the feminist movement highlight in presenting Jesus? This integral Christology is built around the resurrection of the crucified Jesus, highlights love as the key to redemption, and proposes a synthesis of the divine presence through Jesus. Clear, balanced, and accessible, this book should be valued by any student reading systematic theology, anyone training for the ministry in all denominations, as well as interested general readers.</p><p><br>Gerald O' Collins is Research Professor of Theology at St Mary's University College, Twickenham, and Honorary Adjunct Professor of Australian Catholic University.

Laypeople, of course, have been enjoying great success treating animals with the very same substances for many years; for it is not just the medical professionals who can safely and effectively administer these aromatic oils. Anyone enabled with quality essential oils or hydrosols and adequate knowledge can use a plant&#39;s most concentrated and energetic byproducts to improve the health of their animals, and treat and prevent various illnesses and common ailments. Aromatherapy is actually a science that has a much larger archive of supported scientific data than most other holistic care methods. However, most of these studies were originally published in French or German. Aromatherapy was the first natural, holistic therapy the author began using, and she relies on it as my primary form of healthcare to treat and balance all sorts of minor ailments and discomforts in the lives of her family and their pets. She has rarely needed to use any other sort of remedy to achieve the desired result. These powerful substances are the most fascinating, sensual and complex of all natural therapies--a combination that proves to be so enthralling it eventually develops into a grand passion for many.</p><p>Kristen Leigh Bell is a master aromatherapist certified by the Pacific Institute of Aromatherapy, and has been working with aromatherapy and essential oils for more than 10 years.</p><h2>The Pilgrim Church</h2><p>E.H. Broadbent&#39;s book &#34;The Pilgrim Church&#34;, originally published in 1931, is considered a modern classic. It provides a comprehensive history of the church from the apostolic age to the twentieth century through the prism of the New Testament church model. A must read for all students of church history, generalist and specialist alike.</p><p>EDMUND HAMER BROADBENT was born in Lancashire, England, in 1861. Through his personal study of the New Testament while still in his teens, he was convinced of the need to follow the pattern for the church found there. In his early twenties, business took him to Berlin, where he began a long and fruitful ministry to believers all across Europe and into Asia. His travels and research made him aware that since apostolic times there had always been movements to form local churches after the apostolic pattern, and he felt it would be useful to collect what could be known about them in an orderly sequence. This resulted in the publication of The Pilgrim Church. Broadbent was active in ministry until shortly before his death in 1945.</p><h2>Let&#39;s Talk About It: Divorce (Mr. Rogers)</h2><p>"Mister Rogers's talent for calmly explaining scary emotional upheaval to young children shines in this latest volume....Rogers offers caring support and validation for readers working through such trauma, and he supplies concrete examples of ways kids can deal with the stress....Books that offer such honest reassurance are rare." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) "Excellent." -- <i>American Bookseller</i>"This book fills a gaping hole on library shelves." -- <i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>Producer, magician, writer, puppeteer, minister, husband, father, Fred Rogers started out in children's television thirty years ago.

Here, Rogers presents much-needed information to read, discuss, and implement. He defines a family as anyone who gives a child food, care, love, and a place to feel safe. He explains that these main ingredients should remain constant even in the event of a divorce. Children are advised to ask about changes in living arrangements and other aspects of their lives. The text emphasizes that divorce is an adult problem for which children have no responsibility and that it is highly improbable that estranged parents will get back together. The author prescribes activities like talking, drawing, and playing with friends to deal with normal feelings of sadness, anger, and crying. Youngsters are encouraged to have fun even though they may feel guilty at the thought. Judkis's sensitive full-color photographs of three families work well with the text.

Lively and informative, <i>New York Art Deco</i> leads readers step-by-step past the monuments of the 1920s and 30s that recast New York as the world's modern metropolis. Anthony W. Robins, New York's best-known Art Deco guide, includes an introductory essay describing the Art Deco phenomenon, followed by eleven walking tour itineraries in Manhattan each accompanied by a map designed by legendary New York cartographer John Tauranac and a survey of Deco sites across the four other boroughs. Also included is a photo gallery of sixteen color plates by nationally acclaimed Art Deco photographer Randy Juster. In <i>New York Art Deco</i>, Robins has distilled thirty years' worth of experience into a guidebook for all to enjoy at their own pace.</p><p>A native New Yorker and twenty-year veteran of the New York City Landmarks Commission, Anthony W. Robins is the author of books on Grand Central Terminal, the World Trade Center, and the art and architecture of the New York subway system. A popular leader of walking tours all over New York City, he is best known for Art Deco, and organized the city&#39;s first regularly scheduled series of Art Deco tours, sponsored by the Art Deco Society of New York.A wonderful, warmhearted, exceptionally knowledgeable and detailed guidebook that takes you firmly by the hand along fifteen thoughtfully planned itineraries through New York's most exuberant and optimistic architectural heritage: those much-beloved Art Deco skyscrapers, apartment houses, shops, and theaters that stand out as the showy orchids and magnificent birds-of-paradise of the city's building stock. Anthony W. Robins's <em>New York Art Deco</em> is an essential introduction to hundreds of structures that are, as the book says, waiting impatiently for you to visit. Tony Hiss, author of <em>In Motion: The Experience of Travel<br></em><br> Anthony W. Robins has produced what will surely stand as the definitive guide to New York City's Art Deco architecture. The book is an authoritative as well as entertaining tour de force, drawn from the author's encyclopedic knowledge of the subject. Jules Stewart, author of <em>Gotham Rising: New York in the 30s</em> <br><br> Anthony Robins's <em>New York Art Deco</em> fills a void in the design library of New York. Well organized by itineraries that begin at the very tip of Manhattan and work their way into the other four boroughs, it is filled with invaluable information on the monuments of Art Deco and French <em>moderne</em> structures whose design perfectly expresses the streamlined era when speed and movement were celebrated. This is a must-have book for every lover of Art Deco, whether you are a New Yorker or a visitor from New Zealand. David Garrard Lowe, author of <em>Art Deco New York</em> <br><br> The Art Deco style fits New York like a glove, from the skyscraping Chrysler Building to the little, eye-popping Lane Theater on Staten Island, and nobody knows it like Anthony Robins. If you thought you knew Art Deco as I did, before I read his <em>New York Art Deco,</em> then buy this book and be surprised. Christopher Gray, author of the former <em>New York Times</em> Streetscapes column <br><br> Buy this book, take a few wonderful walks around the entire city (discovering some fine New York neighborhoods you probably have never been to), from the Grand Concourse and Washington Heights treasure trove of Deco to the Chrysler Building to Flatbush in Brooklyn, and ask yourself, do all those new glass towers in Manhattan leave you as delighted as Art Deco's confections, whether seven stories or seventy? That generation knew how to make buildings that you really want to live in, work in, and walk by. Thank you, Anthony Robins, for giving us the keys to that kingdom. Barry Lewis, architectural historian<br><br> With the publication of <em>New York Art Deco</em> everyone, from the city explorer to the armchair reader, can now experience Anthony Robins's dynamic Art Deco walking tours. Robins not only discusses the city's famed Deco skyscrapers, but also identifies the spectacular but little-known Deco gems spread across the city.

So he agrees to their radical idea to save his own skin.<br><br>A few surgeries and some intensive training later, and Sal Cupertine is gone, disappeared into the identity of Rabbi David Cohen. Leading his growing congregation in Las Vegas, overseeing the population and the temple and the new cemetery, Rabbi Cohen feels his wicked past slipping away from him, surprising even himself as he spouts quotes from the Torah or the Old Testament. Yet, as it turns out, the Mafia isn't quite done with him yet. Soon the new cemetery is being used as both a money and body-laundering scheme for the Chicago family. And that rogue FBI agent on his trail, seeking vengeance for the murder of his three fellow agents, isn't going to let Sal fade so easily into the desert.<br><br>Gangsterland is the wickedly dark and funny new novel by a writer at the height of his power &#x2013; a morality tale set in a desert landscape as ruthless and barren as those who inhabit it.</p><p><b>Tod Goldberg</b> is the author of the crime-tinged novels <i>Living Dead Girl,</i> a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, <i>Fake Liar Cheat,</i> and the popular <i>Burn Notice</i> series.

But now it looks as if they're about to lose Sweet Dreams to the bank&#x2014;and that would be a disaster, not only for the family but for the town of Icicle Falls, Washington. Can Samantha, the oldest daughter and new head of the company, come up with a way to save it?<br><br>After Samantha does some brainstorming with her mother and sisters, inspiration strikes.

To make matters worse, the fate of her company is in the hands of her archenemy, Blake Preston, the bank manager with the football-hero good looks. It's enough to drive her to chocolate.

You can visit Sheila on Twitter and Facebook or at her website (http://www.sheilasplace.com).<br><br>Samantha Sterling sat next to her mother in the first pew of Icicle Falls Community Church and fought back the urge to jump up, run to the front of the sanctuary, grab her stepfather, Waldo, by the neck and throttle him. She didn't, for two reasons. One, a girl didn't do things like that in church. Still, she could have overcome her reservations if not for the second reason&#x2014;God had already taken Waldo out. Waldo was as dead as roadkill on Highway 2. In addition to a daughter from his first marriage, he'd left behind his grieving wife, Muriel, his three stepdaughters, Samantha, Cecily and Bailey, and the family business, which was nearly as dead as Waldo.<br><br>Sweet Dreams Chocolates had been healthy when Samantha's father was alive. The company had been started by her great-grandmother Rose and had slowly but steadily grown under his leadership&#x2014;one big, happy family to mirror the happy family who were living off its profits. All three sisters had spent their summers working at Sweet Dreams. All three had it drummed into them from an early age that this business was the source of both the family's income and honor (not to mention chocolate). But it was Samantha who had fallen in love with it. Of the three girls, she was the one who'd stayed and she was the heir apparent.<br><br>But then her father had died and everything came to a halt. Samantha lost the man she and her sisters idolized, and her mother lost her way. Muriel left it to Samantha and the bookkeeper, Lizzy, to keep the company running on autopilot while first she mourned and then later searched for a new husband.<br><br>Enter Waldo Wittman, a tall, gray-haired widower recently retired, encouraged to do so by his company, which was downsizing. (Now, looking back, Samantha suspected there were other reasons Waldo had been turned loose.) He'd wanted to get away from the rat race, or so he'd said. With its mountain views, its proximity to eastern Washington wine country, its small-town friendliness and its attractive widow, Waldo decided Icicle Falls would fit the bill. And Muriel decided the same about Waldo. So, after a year and a half of widowhood, she got a new man.<br><br>And now there he was, at the front of the church, stretched out in his favorite&#x2014;expensive!&#x2014;gray suit. Sweet, beloved Waldo...the money-eater. <em>Oh, Waldo, how could everything have gone so wrong so fast?</em><br><br>It was early January, the beginning of a new year. And what a nightmare year it was promising to be, all because Mom had made her new husband president of their family-owned business. She'd left Samantha as VP in charge of marketing; much good that had done.<br><br>Now Samantha was VP in charge of disaster and she could hardly sit still thinking of the mess waiting for her back at the office.<br><br>"You're fidgeting," whispered her sister Cecily, who was sitting next to her.<br><br>Fidgeting at a funeral probably wasn't polite but it was an improvement over standing up, pulling out her hair and shrieking like a madwoman.<br><br>Why, oh, why hadn't Mom and Dad done what needed to be done to make sure that if something happened to Dad the business passed into competent hands? Then Mom could have skipped happily off into newly-wed bliss, no harm no foul.<br><br>None of them had expected her to remain alone forever. She was only in her fifties when Dad died and she didn't function well alone.<br><br>When Waldo arrived on the scene she came back to life, and Samantha had been happy for her. He was fun and charming, and she and her sisters gave him a hearty thumbs-up. Why not? He'd brought back Mom's smile. At first everyone got along well. Like Samantha, he'd been a shutterbug and they'd enjoyed talking photography. Her favorite joke when she'd stop by the house to talk business with Mom (or try, anyway) was to ask, "Where's Waldo?"<br><br>But once Mom dropped him on the company like a bomb, Samantha didn't have to ask. She knew where Waldo was. He was at the office, in over his head and making her crazy.<br><br>She ground her teeth as she mentally tallied how much money he'd squandered: new business cards with his name on them, new stationery, new equipment they hadn't needed, a fancy phone system they couldn't afford that a slick-tongued sales rep had talked him into buying. How could a businessman be so bad at business? Of course he'd convinced both himself and Mom that every purchase was necessary, and Samantha hadn't had the veto power to stop him.<br><br>That had been just the beginning. Six months ago their profits sank and they started having trouble paying their suppliers. Waldo cut back on production, which then affected their ability to fill orders, and Lizzy, their bookkeeper, began looking as if she'd been invited to dinner with the grim reaper. "We're behind on our IRS quarterlies," she'd informed Samantha. "And that's not all." She showed Samantha expenditures on the company credit card that made no sense. A gun. Ammunition. Cases and cases of bottled water, enough to keep the whole town hydrated. Waldo was a financial locust, devouring the company.<br><br>Where's Waldo? Busy dumping their lives in the toilet. <em>Flush, flush, flush!</em> She could have happily stuffed his head in a toilet and&#x2014;<br><br>"And I believe that if Waldo could speak to us now he'd say, 'Thank God for a life well-lived,'" Pastor Jim said.<br><br>Her mother let out a sob and Samantha felt a pang of guilt. She should be crying, too. She'd liked Waldo. He'd been a man with a big heart and a big appetite for life.<br><br>"We know he'll be missed," Pastor Jim was saying, and Cecily laid a comforting hand on Mom's arm. That, of course, gave Mom permission to start crying in earnest.<br><br>"Poor Mom," whispered Bailey, who was sitting on the other side of Samantha. "First Dad and now Waldo." Losing two husbands&#x2014;talk about a double whammy.<br><br>Mom had not only loved both her husbands, she'd loved being married. She had no head for business (which probably explained why Grandpa had been perfectly happy to let Dad run Sweet Dreams), but she had a gift for relationships. She'd even had a couple of relationship books published with a small publisher and before Waldo died she'd been about to start on a new book, <em>Secrets of a Happy Remarriage.</em><br><br>Samantha hoped that now Mom would turn her attention to learning how to have a happy life&#x2014;with <em>no</em> marriage. At least, no marriage until they could get the business off the critical-care list and Samantha was put officially in charge.<br><br><em>The sooner, the better.</em> Her first order of business would be to rehire Lizzy, who Waldo had fired in a misbegotten attempt to economize. She only hoped Lizzy would come back and help her sort through this mess.<br><br>She heaved a sigh. Here her mother was grieving and all she could think about was saving the family business. What was wrong with her? Did she have a calculator for a heart?<br><br>"Now I'd like to give the rest of you a chance to say something about Waldo," Pastor Jim said.<br><br><em>He made me nuts</em> probably wouldn't cut it. Saman-tha stayed seated.<br><br>Lots of other people were happy to oblige, though.<br><br>"He was the most generous man I ever met," said Maria Gomez, his regular waitress at Zelda's. "He gave me two hundred dollars to get my car fixed. Just like that. Said not to worry about paying him back."<br><br>Samantha pressed her lips firmly together and envisioned hundred-dollar bills with wings flying away, circling ever upward and off toward Sleeping Lady Mountain.<br><br><em>You do have a calculator for a heart.</em> People were talking about how nice Waldo had been, and all she could think about was money. She was a terrible person, a terrible, terrible person. She hadn't always been like that, had she? A tear slipped from a corner of her eye.<br><br>Ed York, owner of D'Vine Wines, stood. "I can still remember sitting with Waldo out on his deck, looking at the mountains, sharing a bottle of wine, and him saying, 'You know, Ed, it doesn't get any better than this.' That Waldo, he sure knew how to enjoy life."<br><br><em>While everyone around him was pulling out their hair.</em><br><br>"He was a dear soul," old Mrs. Nilsen said. "Last month he stopped in the freezing cold to change my tire when I had a flat on Highway 2."<br><br>On and on went the praise. Good, old, wonderful Waldo. Everyone here would miss him&#x2014;except his rotten, ungrateful, Scrooge-in-drag, calculator-for-a-heart stepdaughter. She was pathetic. Another tear sneaked out of her eye and trickled down her cheek.<br><br>Pastor Jim finally called a halt to the festivities and the party made its way under cloudy skies to Festival Hall, where everyone could mingle, sing Waldo's praises further and devour cold cuts and potato salad. Inside, the three sisters smiled and commiserated.<br><br>Waldo's brother and his daughter, Wanda, had flown in from the East Coast. Taking in the woman's red eyes as she approached, Samantha managed to find empathy in the swirl of guilt and resentment and frustration she was experiencing<br><br>"I'm sorry we're having to see each other again in such sad circumstances," Wanda said. "So are we," Cecily told her.<br><br>"I'm sorry for your loss," Samantha added. And she was. She knew how horrible it was to lose a father and she wouldn't wish that on her worst enemy.<br><br>Wanda dabbed at her eyes with a soggy tissue. "I can't believe he's gone. He was the best father. And he was always so positive, so upbeat."<br><br><em>So clueless.</em> "I wish we could turn back the clock," Samantha said.<br><br>Wanda sniffed and nodded. "You were all so good to him."<br><br>Samantha couldn't think of anything to say to that. She hardly wanted to confess that during the past few months she'd been anything but good.<br><br>Cecily stepped into the gap. "He was a nice man."<br><br>True. He was just a bad businessman.<br><br>"He sure loved Muriel," Wanda said. "He was so lonely after Mother died. Muriel gave him a new lease on life."<br><br>"And I don't know what her life would've been like without him," Samantha said.<br><br>"I think Muriel would like to hear that, Wanda," murmured Waldo's brother, Walter, as he led their longdistance stepsister away.<br><br>"I need a drink," Samantha said.<br><br>"Great idea," Bailey agreed, and they all drifted over to the punch bowl.<br><br>Samantha really wasn't much of a drinker, but a good stiff belt sure seemed to help a lot of movie characters through stressful moments and right about now she was willing to give it a try. "I wish this was spiked," she muttered.<br><br>Bailey looked across the room at their mother. "I feel so bad for Mom."<br><br>Muriel Sterling-Wittman sat on a folding chair framed by the weak winter light coming through the window behind her, a beautiful tragic figure starting the new year alone. Her basic black dress discreetly draped her Betty Boop curves and her hair was still the same shiny chestnut it had been when Samantha was a girl, courtesy of the geniuses at Sleeping Lady Salon. The green eyes Waldo once raved about were bloodshot from crying but still looked lovely thanks to lashes thick with waterproof mascara. Half the men in the room were hovering around with tissues in case she found herself in need.<br><br>"Well, at least we won't have to worry about her being lonely," Bailey said. She was the spitting image of their mother and the most like her, as well&#x2014;sweet, positive and naive.<br><br>Cecily gave a cynical snort. "Much good any of those men will do her. They're all married."<br><br>"Not Ed," Bailey pointed out.<br><br>"He's got the hots for Pat over at the bookstore," Sa-mantha said, and mentally added, <em>Thank God.</em><br><br>"Arnie's not married," Bailey said. "Neither is Mayor Stone. Or Waldo's brother. Wouldn't it be sweet if&#x2014;"<br><br>Samantha cut her off. "Let's not even put that thought out in the universe." All they needed was another man coming along and convincing Mom that the third time would be the charm.<br><br>"Look at them. Waldo's barely gone and they're already circling around her like some old-guy version of <em>The Bachelor."</em> Cecily shook her head. "Men."<br><br>"You know, for a matchmaker you sure have a sucky attitude," Bailey observed.<br><br>"Where do you think I got it?" Cecily retorted.<br><br>"How do you manage to stay in business?" Bailey asked in disgust.<br><br>"By staying superficial." Cecily gave them a wicked grin.<br><br>Cecily was the only blonde in the family and she was the prettiest of them all with perfect features and the longest legs. Samantha had been cute with her red hair and freckles, but it was Cecily the boys drooled over. Still, in spite of her good looks, Cupid had never been kind to her. So far she'd gone through two fiances. Samantha didn't understand how Cecily could make money matching up beautiful people in L.A. but couldn't seem to get it right when it came to her own love life.<br><br><em>Like you're doing so well?</em><br><br><em>Touche,</em> she told her snarky self.<br><br>"You're enough to make a woman give up on love," Bailey muttered as she nodded and smiled politely at old Mr. Nilsen, who was ogling her from the other side of the hall.<br><br>"That would be the smart thing to do," Cecily said.<br><br>"Well, I don't think Mom's ready to give up on love. Maybe you could match her up with someone," Bailey suggested.<br><br>"No!" Several people turned to stare and Samantha downed a slug of punch in an effort to put out the fire in her cheeks. What was wrong with her? Could a woman suddenly get Tourette's at thirty?<br><br>The wicked in Cecily's grin kicked up a notch. "I know what you mean. No one will ever be able to replace Waldo."<br><br>"I liked Waldo, I really did," Samantha said. "But no more men. I've got enough to deal with already."<br><br>"Gosh, Sammy." Bailey frowned at her.<br><br>Samantha frowned back. "Hey, baby sister, you two get to go back to sunny California and match up lonely millionaires and cater events for starlets. I'm the one stuck with the fallout here."<br><br>Cecily sobered. "I'm sorry. You're right. We're leaving you with a mess. You've got the business to sort out, plus Mom's affairs."<br><br>"Except if anyone can do it, you can, Sammy," Bailey said, linking arms with her.<br><br>Samantha sighed. As the oldest it was her job to be the rock everyone leaned on&#x2014;although right now she didn't feel like a rock. She felt like a pebble on a beach about to be swept away by a tsunami.<br><br>And her own mother had been the one to unwittingly drop her there. She and Muriel loved each other dearly, but they often disagreed. And before Waldo died they'd disagreed a lot, especially when Samantha tried to get her mother to talk sense into him.<br><br>"He's not feeling well," Mom kept saying, but when pressed for details she'd remained vague.<br><br>Maybe the poor guy's heart had been acting up all along. Maybe he'd been so worried about his bad health he hadn't been able to concentrate and that was why he'd made such poor decisions. Except that didn't explain his odd purchases. Or the answers he'd given her when she asked about them.<br><br></p><h2>Into the Dark: The Hidden World of Film Noir, 1941-1950 (Turner Classic Movies)</h2><p><p>You know film noir when you see it: the shadowed setting; the cynical detective; the femme fatale; and the twist of fate. <i>Into the Dark</i> captures this alluring genre with a cavalcade of compelling photographs and a guide to 82 of its best films.<br><i>Into the Dark</i> is the first book to tell the story of film noir in its own voice.

Your brain will light up like Manhattan skyscrapers at dusk, sparkle like diamonds under jewelry store lights, glow like stars in the black sky above a farmer&#x2019;s field.<br><br> American philosopher William James &nbsp;says, &#x201c;The greatest dis- covery of any generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>The Happiness Advantage &nbsp;</i>author Shawn Achor says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s &nbsp;not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.&#x201d;<br><br> William Shakespeare &nbsp;says, &#x201c;For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>2. The single biggest reason it&#x2019;s so hard &nbsp;to be happy</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Shakespeare &nbsp;says, &#x201c;For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&#x201d; But if it&#x2019;s just thinking, plain thinking,&nbsp;why can&#x2019;t we&nbsp;<i>think </i>ourselves into a good mood whenever we want? <br><br>Seems like we should be able to just flip a mental switch.<br><br> But we all know it&#x2019;s not that easy. Sometimes our brains get fo- cused on negative things. We can&#x2019;t stop! I do this all the time. And you want to know a secret? Everybody &nbsp;does. Every single person gets stuck focusing on the negative sometimes. I&#x2019;ve spoken on stages with the best-known motivational speakers, Fortune 500 CEOs, and political leaders from around the world. Do you know what they&#x2019;re all doing backstage? Freaking out. Sweating. Thinking something might go wrong.<br><br> We all have negative self-talk. There is no such thing as an eter- nal optimist. There are people who feel optimistic, but those people have negative self-talk, too. And that&#x2019;s okay. The problem isn&#x2019;t that we have negative thoughts in our brain.<br><br> The problem is we think we shouldn&#x2019;t have negative thoughts.<br><br> But <i>why </i>do our brains focus on negative things? Once we under- stand this we can learn how much we can control and make con- scious efforts to be happy using proven techniques.<br><br>This is one of the most important things I can share with you. Why is it so hard to be happy? <br><br>Because life was mostly short, brutal, and &nbsp;highly &nbsp;competitive over &nbsp;the two hundred thousand years our species has existed on this planet. And our brains are trained for this short, brutal, and highly competitive world.<br> &nbsp;<br> How short, brutal, and highly competitive was it?&nbsp;Let&#x2019;s do a quick experiment.<br><br> Stop, close your eyes, and picture the last time you felt com- pletely alone in the middle of nowhere.<br><br> Was it camping in the mountains when you walked away from the fire and stood on the jagged edge of a mirrory lake? Was it a misty waterfall you found on a field trip when your classmates dis- appeared and all you could hear was the wind rustling the leaves in the forest canopy? Was it jogging at sunrise on a sandy beach when you curled around the coastline and suddenly couldn&#x2019;t see anyone for miles in any direction?<br><br> Picture yourself back in that scene.<br><br> Now mentally erase from our planet all of the following: <br>� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toilets<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinks<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showers<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running water<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phones<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beds<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chairs<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roads<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bikes<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planes<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boats<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Books<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paper<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pencils<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pens<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctors<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medicines<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grocery stores<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fridges<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freezers<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farms<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoves<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microwaves<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirts<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweaters<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackets<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pants<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socks<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoes<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underwear <br><br> You are now standing alone in the middle of the planet with none of those things. Take your phone out of your pocket and toss it away. Take your shoes &nbsp;and shirt off, too, because &nbsp;they don&#x2019;t exist. Take everything off. You are completely naked with noth- ing around. None of those things exist. And none of them will be gin to exist before the end of your life!<br><br> Now close your eyes, picture yourself there, and remember that:<br> &nbsp;<br> 99% of our history was living in this world.<br> 99% of our history was with a life span of thirty years.<br> 99% of our history was with brains constantly battling for survival.<br> &nbsp;<br> Life was short, brutal, and highly competitive, and we have the same brains now that we&#x2019;ve had throughout our history.<br><br> Were we happy back then? The better question &nbsp;is: Did we have time to be happy?<br><br>This instinctive need for what we don&#x2019;t yet have creates in us a persistent state of dissatisfaction. Without it, our ancestors would always be only one failed hunting session away from starvation. This simple, ruthless script is pro- grammed to drive survival at all costs. It works exceed- ingly well for this purpose, but it leaves us feeling stress and unpleasantness much of the time. Unhappiness is na- ture&#x2019;s way of keeping people on their toes. It&#x2019;s a crude sys- tem, but it has worked for thousands of years. <br>&nbsp;<br> We have the same brains we&#x2019;ve always had through this short, bru- tal, and highly competitive time in our history. Our brains didn&#x2019;t just suddenly change when we got printing presses, airplanes, and the Internet. How have our brains been programmed? <br><br> What did this fear do? It drove our survival. We survived at all costs. We were paranoid. We were fighters. We were ruthless. We were brutal. We were murderous. And because of it . . . we got here. And because of it . . . we took over the planet. And because of it . . . we have everything in the world.<br><br> So this begs the question: Is that fear still programmed into our heads today?<br><b>3. The one thing &nbsp;your doctor, &nbsp;teacher, and&nbsp;Tom Hanks &nbsp;all have &nbsp;in common</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Yes, that fear is still programmed into our heads.<br><br> It&#x2019;s everywhere, it&#x2019;s between our ears, it&#x2019;s in our brains. Tom Hanks, one of the world&#x2019;s most successful actors, who earns&nbsp;millions with every movie and has scored two Academy Awards, said, &#x201c;Some people go to bed at night thinking, &#x2018;That was a good day.&#x2019; I am one of those who worries and asks, &#x2018;How did I screw up today?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> Andy Grove is the longtime Intel executive who helped trans- form the company into a multibillion-dollar &nbsp;success. He was be- lieved by many to have helped drive the growth phase of Silicon Valley, was named <i>Time</i>&#x2019;s Man of the Year in 1997, and was idolized by Steve Jobs, according to Jobs&#x2019;s biography. How did he famously put it? &#x201c;Only the paranoid survive.&#x201d;<br><br> Our brains still follow this paranoid model every day, and it is a recipe for unhappiness! Some call it Medical Student&#x2019;s Syndrome. That&#x2019;s &nbsp;a term Jerome K. Jerome first coined in his 1889 classic, <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>: &#x201c;I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch&#x2014;hay fever, I fancy it was. I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally. I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into&#x2014;some fearful, devastating scourge, I know&#x2014;and, before I had glanced half down the list of &#x2018;premonitory symptoms,&#x2019; it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;I sat for a while, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages. I came to typhoid fever&#x2014; read the symptoms&#x2014;discovered &nbsp;that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it&#x2014;wondered what else I had got; turned up St. Vitus&#x2019;s Dance&#x2014;found, as I expected, that I had that, too&#x2014;began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically&#x2014;read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight . . .&#x201d;<br> It&#x2019;s not just medical students. We&#x2019;ve all been there.<br><br> We scan the world for problems because that led to our survival. And our current design of the world only reinforces and grows these negative-lens feelings.<br><br> At your doctor&#x2019;s office when you get lab results, the doctor says, &#x201c;Your blood sugar is fine, your cholesterol is fine, but your iron is low.&#x201d; What do you do? You talk about getting your iron up. Eat steak! No work is done improving your blood sugar or cholesterol. If cholesterol should be below 200mg/dL &nbsp;and you&#x2019;re &nbsp;at 195, great! If you&#x2019;re 205, that&#x2019;s a problem. Doctors get paid when we&#x2019;re sick. Shouldn&#x2019;t we pay them when we&#x2019;re healthy?<br><br> Retail store managers &nbsp;&#x201c;manage by exception&#x201d; by staring at morning reports, finding a number below average, and trying to bump it up. If that report says your traffic count is fine, basket size is fine, but checkout time is below average, what does the boss want? Faster checkouts. More cashiers! No work is done improving statis- tics that are already average.<br><br> In the classroom the teacher hands back test results and offers extra help to those below average. They have to pass! If not, the&nbsp;year is repeated, the system &nbsp;is drained, friends all move ahead. What happens for the below average kids? Extra help at lunch. Tutoring sessions. Remedial tests. Why aren&#x2019;t students who get 100% offered any extra challenge?<br>&nbsp; <br>It&#x2019;s no different in the workplace. We get job evaluations show- ing how well we&#x2019;re doing. What happens if you&#x2019;re below expecta- tions? &nbsp;Performance improvement plan! &nbsp;Extra meetings with the boss! Shipped to training classes! What happens if you&#x2019;re &nbsp;doing well? Two percent raise. Pat on the back.<br><br> Rather than find good results and make them better, our brains do this:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. &nbsp;Look for problem.<br> 2. &nbsp;Find problem.<br> 3. &nbsp;Improve problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s &nbsp;what our brains have been trained to do for two hun- dred thousand years. But because we scan the world for problems, sometimes that&#x2019;s all we see. Here&#x2019;s how <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author Kelly Oxford framed our Medical Student&#x2019;s Syndrome on Twitter: &#x201c;WebMD is &nbsp;like a Choose Your Own Adventure book where the ending is always cancer.&#x201d;<br> So what do we do about it? <br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>5. How much &nbsp;can we control?</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Aristotle says, &#x201c;Happiness depends upon ourselves.&#x201d;<br><br> Viktor Frankl says, &#x201c;Everything &nbsp;can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms&#x2014;to &nbsp;choose one&#x2019;s at- titude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#x2019;s own way.&#x201d; Walt Whitman &nbsp;writes, &nbsp;&#x201c;Keep your face always toward the&nbsp;sunshine&#x2014;and shadows will fall behind you.&#x201d;<br><br> I love what Artistotle, Viktor Frankl, and Walt Whitman say.

The second last sentence!<br><br> &#x201c;I am convinced that life is 10% what happens and 90% how I&nbsp;react to it.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, new research published in <i>The How of Happiness </i>by Uni- versity of California psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky tells us exactly how much of our happiness is based on our life circumstances.<br><br> And it is 10%!<br><br> 10% of our happiness is what happens <i>to </i>us.<br> &nbsp;<br>So 90% of our happiness isn&#x2019;t based on what&#x2019;s happening in the world! <i>It&#x2019;s based on how we see the world</i>.

Those are <i>specific things </i>we can do to improve our happiness. And they alone have <i>four times the ef- fect on our happiness </i>than anything happening in our life. <br><br> Let me put it another way:&nbsp;If I knew everything about your life circumstances&#x2014;your job, your health, your marital status, your income&#x2014;I could predict only&nbsp;10% of your happiness.

Pro- fessors of psychology Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmih- alyi are called the fathers of positive psychology because of their passion for cold hard facts. As they put it themselves in <i>American Psychologist</i>:<br><br> &#x201c;Psychology is not just a branch of medicine concerned with ill- ness or health; it is much larger. It is about work, education, insight, love, growth, and play. And in this quest for what is best, positive psychology does not rely on wishful thinking, faith, self-deception, fads, or hand-waving; it tries to adapt what is best in the scientific method to the unique problems that ...</p><h2>Odes</h2><p>Following the Pulitzer prize-winning collection&nbsp;<i>Stag&#x2019;s Leap</i>, Sharon Olds gives us a stunning book of odes. Opening with the powerful and tender &#x201c;Ode to the Hymen,&#x201d; Olds addresses and embodies, in this age-old poetic form, many aspects of love and gender and sexual politics in a collection that is centered on the body and its structures and pleasures. The poems extend parts of her narrative as a daughter, mother, wife, lover, friend, and poet of conscience that will be familiar from earlier collections, each episode and memory burnished by the wisdom and grace and humor of looking back. In such poems as &#x201c;Ode to My Sister,&#x201d; &#x201c;Ode of Broken Loyalty,&#x201d; &#x201c;Ode to My Whiteness,&#x201d; &#x201c;Blow Job Ode,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ode to the Last Thirty-Eight Trees in New York City Visible from This Window,&#x201d;&nbsp;Olds treats us to an intimate examination that, like all her work, is universal, by turns searing and charming in its honesty. From the bodily joys and sorrows of childhood to the deaths of those dearest to us, Olds shapes the world in language that is startlingly fresh, profound in its conclusions, and life-giving for the reader.</p><p>Winner of the 2016 Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets<br><b><br>SHARON OLDS </b>was born in San Francisco and educated at Stanford University and Columbia University. The winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and England&#x2019;s T. S. Eliot Prize for her 2012 collection,&nbsp;<i>Stag&#x2019;s Leap</i>, she is the author of ten previous books of poetry and the winner of many other awards and honors, including the Wallace Stevens Award, the inaugural San Francisco Poetry Center Award for her first book,&nbsp;<i>Satan Says</i>&nbsp;(1980), and the National Book Critics Circle Award for her second, <i>The Dead and the Living</i>, which was also the Lamont Poetry Selection for 1983.&nbsp;<i>The Father&nbsp;</i>was short-listed for the T.

She lives in New York City.&#x201c;A brazenly honest, humorous meditation on the body, sex, love, and death . . . A bold yet charming celebration of both the poetic form and the imperfection of our humanness.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jarry Lee, <i>BuzzFeed</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>Odes </i>picks up where <i>Stag&#x2019;s Leap </i>left off, which is to say that it contains some of the best and most ingenious poems of her career .&#x201d; &#x2014;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;<i>Odes </i>sees Olds fully restored to the world, enjoying life in all its variety. It&#x2019;s perhaps the funniest book I&#x2019;ve read this year, and also among the most moving and philosophical, charged with the kind of metaphysical self-interrogation that is a central, though often overlooked, aspect of her work.&#x201d; &#x2014;Alexandra Schwartz, <i>The New Yorker</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Olds has many lurid imitators who miss her great project. Yes, her poems present matter-of-celebratory-fact aspects of the body sexual, but they never merely focus on parts as parts. Instead, they are connected to the whole of human experience, personal, historical, and even mythological.&#x201d; &#x2014;Fred Dings, <i>World Literature Today<br><br></i>&#x201c;Sharon Olds is a poet for these times, a powerful woman who won&#x2019;t back down.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;</i>Diana Whitney, <i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i></p><h2>Qigong Meditation: Small Circulation (Qigong Foundation)</h2><p><strong></strong><strong>ForeWord's Book of the Year Award FINALIST - 2006</strong><strong><br></strong><p>Small Circulation, or the Microcosmic Orbit, is the practice of circulating energy, within the human body, Qi, through the two main pathways, or "vessels" of the body. This practice is considered to be the foundation of Internal Elixir Qigong, and was a fundamental step on the path of meditation training in ancient times. Over the centuries, this practice has slowly been lost from many meditation traditions, and its importance has been forgotten.</p><p>Small Circulation regulates the Qi circulating in the Twelve Primary Qi channels, making it abundant throughout the entire body, which has been known for centuries for promoting health and longevity. This is also the foundation of Muscle/Tendon Changing Qigong (Yi Jin), which deeply conditions and strengthens the body. It is advised that you begin your meditation training by practicing Embryonic Breathing, which will help you to establish your central energy system, and to conserve and store this energy to abundant levels. Building on this foundation, Small Circulation is the next required stage of meditation training. Ultimately, one then practices Grand Circulation Meditation, which circulates Qi everywhere in the body and exchanges it with partners and the surrounding environment. Its purpose is to open the third eye and reunite the human spirit with the spirit of nature.</p><p>This book contains translation and analysis of many ancient documents used to transmit Small Circulation and Internal Elixir cultivation to future generations, and offers modern scientific explanation for learning and training safely. Though meditation is popular today for relaxation and general health, the ultimate goal of this training, in both Daoism (Taoism) and Buddhism, is spiritual enlightenment.</p><ul><li>Small Circulation Meditation builds the body from weak to strong and trains the mind to be calm and focused.</li><li>Dr. Yang presents a modern method for learning safely.</li><li>Includes scientific analysis, translation and commentary of ancient documents, and a summary of the practice methods.</li></ul></p><p><b> FINALIST for Book of the Year Award: </b> Mind/Body/Spirit, 2006 <br> (Sponsored by Foreword Magazine)<strong>Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming</strong> is a renowned author and teacher of Chinese martial arts and Qigong.

We hope you learn to love the heroes and heroines who helped shape this great country. And by doing so, we hope you also develop a lasting love for the nation that gave them the opportunity to make their dreams come true.

I heard Yiddish every day from my parents and grandparents and from the families of my friends. There was Italian around the corner, Cuban Spanish down the block, Russian in the recesses of the subway station. Some of my earliest memories are of their sounds. But there were also words of what seemed to be my own family's making and that I have found in no dictionaries: <i>konditterei</i>, a strange blend of Yiddish and Italian calibrated to describe the self-important caf� set; vachmalyavatet, a tongue-twister used to signify complete exhaustion; lachlat, a cross between a poncho and a peacoat that my father pointed out one afternoon.</p> <p>Still, there was always English, always the desire, in my father's father's idiom, to be a "Yenkee." My mother was a speech therapist in the New York City schools; my father, a history and English teacher. For the first decade of my life, we lived a dream of bettering ourselves through English. We tried to lose the accent of the immigrant. We memorized poetry. Days I would spend with Walt Whitman (de facto poet laureate of Brooklyn) until I was called in, O Captain-ing together with him straight to supper. I read Beowulf in junior high, and in the arc of Anglo-Saxon or the lilt of Chaucer's Middle English I found words that shared the Germanic roots of Yiddish. There was that prefix for the participle, ge-, in all those languages. If Grendel's mother was gemyndig, mindful, remembering, harboring a grudge, then so too was my mother. Everything in my family was <i>gehacktet</i>�ground up, hacked to bits, whether it was the chicken livers that we spread on toast or the troubles that beset us all (the Yiddish phrase "gehacktet tsuris," hacked up troubles, has always stayed with me. I think of Grendel's leavings -- the dismembered bodies of the Danes -- with no more apt phrase).</p> <p>At Oxford, I studied for a degree in medieval English languages and linguistics. J. R. R. Tolkien and W. H. Auden had died only a couple of years before I arrived, and Oxford in the 1970s had an elegiac quality about it. Tolkien and Auden were the two poles of its English studies: the first philological, medieval, and fantastic; the second, emotive, modern, and all too real. My tutors were their students and their self-appointed heirs. I learned the minutiae of philology, details whose descriptions had an almost incantatory magic: Frisian fronting, aesh one and aesh two, lengthening in open syllables. I went to bed dreaming about the Ormulum and the orthoepists. And then, one evening in the spring of 1977, in some grotty dining hall, I heard the poets Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney read. Heaney got up, all red-faced and smiling, brilliant in his breath. He read poems about bog men -- ancient Germanic people who had been preserved in peat for fifteen hundred years. Twenty-five years later, I found in Heaney's Beowulf translation what I had felt on that evening: the sense that the study of the word revealed not just a history of culture but a history of the self. "I had undergone," Heaney writes of his study of Old English in the introduction to his Beowulf, "something like illumination by philology."</p> <p>Philology means "love of language," but for scholars it connotes the discipline of historical linguistic study. For Seamus Heaney, or for you or me, philology illuminates the history of words and those who speak them. My goal in this book is to illuminate: to bring light into language and to life. Whether you grew up in New York or New Mexico, whether your first words were in this or any other tongue, you are reading this book in the language of an early-twenty-first-century American. Writing at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Washington Irving called America a "logocracy" -- a country of words. We all still live in a logocracy -- invented then and reinvented everyday by citizens of language like ourselves.</p> <p>This is a book about inventing English (invent, from the Latin <i>invenire</i>, to come upon or find). Each of its chapters illustrates how people found new ways to speak and write; how they dealt with the resources of language of their time and place; and how, through individual imagination, they transformed those resources into something uniquely personal. These chapters may be read in sequence, as you read a textbook or a novel; or they may be read as individual essays, each one suitable for bed or as a pause in the day's tasks. My book, therefore, is less a history of English in the traditional sense than it is an episodic epic: a portable assembly of encounters with the language. Each episode recalls a moment when a person or a group finds something new or preserves something old; when someone writes down something that exemplifies a change; when the experience of language, personally or professionally, stands as a defining moment in the arc of speech.</p> <p>All of us find or invent our language. We may come up with new sentences never heard before. We may use words in a unique way. But we are always finding our voice, locating old patterns or long-heard expressions, reaching into our thesaurus for the right term. And in inventing English, we are always inventing ourselves -- finding our place among the welter of the words or in the swell of sounds that is the ocean of our tongue.</p> <p>And this, it seems to me, is what is new about this book -- its course between the individual experience and literary culture, between the details of the past and the drama of the present, between the story of my life I tell here and the stories you may make out of your own. Histories of the English language abound, and different readers find themselves in each. Scholars research and write out of the great six-volume Cambridge History of the English Language. Teachers work from textbooks such as Albert C. Baugh and Thomas M. Cable's History of the English Language. The interested public has had, for the past half century, books ranging from Mario Pei's The Story of the English Language, to Anthony Burgess's A Mouthful of Air, Bill Bryson's The Mother Tongue, and the illustrated companion to the PBS series The Story of English. A university professor such as David Crystal has sought wider audiences for his arguments in The Stories of English. And I have spent the last decade addressing listeners and viewers of my lecture series prepared for the Teaching Company, The History of the English Language. I have spoken to college students, adult education classes, social clubs, and professional organizations. The fact remains that people of all vocations or politics are fascinated by the history of English, and my book invites the reader to invest in his or her (and my own) fascination with the word.</p> <p>I think that we are fascinated by English not only because of how it has changed over time but because of how it changes now. Within a single person's lifetime, words shift their meaning; pronunciations differentiate themselves; idioms from other tongues, from popular culture, and from commerce inflect our public life. English is in flux. E-mail and the Internet have altered the arc of our sentences. Much has been made of all these changes: by the linguist Geoffrey Nunberg in his provocative radio and newspaper essays (collected in his book, The Way We Talk Now), or by the journalist William Safire in his weekly New York Times Magazine column. For all the nuance of their observations, however, neither of these commentators (nor really anyone else) locates our current changes in the larger history of English. The shifts we see today have historical precedents. Our debates about standards and dialects, politics and pronunciation recall arguments by pedagogues and poets, lexicographers and literati, from the Anglo-Saxon era of the tenth century, through the periods of medieval, Renaissance, and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century society. This book therefore grows out of my conviction that to understand a language it is necessary to appreciate its history. We speak and spell for reasons that are often lost to us. But we can rediscover these reasons.</p> <p>This book recovers answers to our current questions, and it illustrates how language is a form of social behavior central to our past and present lives. Throughout its historical survey, this book sets out to raise some basic questions for the study of our language -- questions that have been asked at all times in its history.</p> <p>Is there, or should there be, a "standard English"? Should it be defined as the idiom of the educated, the sound of the city-dweller, the style of the business letter? As early as the tenth century, teachers in the monastic schools of Anglo-Saxon England asked this question. Some claimed there should be rules for spelling, speech, and usage. Such rules were grounded in a particular dialect of Old English -- the one that was geographically central to the region of the king's court and the church's administration. Similar attentions to dialect and standards were the subject of debates throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Was there, asked teachers and students alike, a particular regional form of English that should form a national standard? Should we write the way we speak? Should speech display one's education (and thus something that could be learned) or should it reveal one's class and region (and thus something that reflected birth)? In asking questions such as these, teachers and scholars throughout history have raised another major question. Should the study of language be prescriptive or descriptive? Dictionaries, for example, record spelling, pronunciation, meaning, and usage. Are they simply recording habits of language or are they also codifying them? Isn't any description also a prescription? When we present the features of a language -- and when we do so through authoritative venues such as dictionaries, school texts, or public journalism -- are we simply saying how we speak and w...</p></p><h2>The Flash Vol. 5: Negative (Rebirth)</h2><p><b>The Fastest Man Alive continues his monumental run in DC Universe Rebirth!

This huge 182 page 8x11 size technical book teaches techniques of professional trap shooting; singles, handicap and double trap. Endorsed by professional shooters and ranks #1 by trap shooting magazines worldwide!</p><p>Like his other volume, <i>Precision Shooting</i>, James Russell's <i>Trap Shooting Secrets</i> is thick with tips, advice, techniques, and practice drills for anyone intent on improving his or her skills in a highly refined, complex, and technically demanding sport. Russell begins with a primer on buying the right shotgun, and builds from there on the essentials of basic shooting and a whole gamut of typical beginner's mistakes before moving on to more advanced targets like the psychology of competitive shooting, developing deeper concentration skills, and strategies for how to write off some of the high costs of trap shooting as a tax deduction. As informative as the volume is, it loses some points on style: pages crammed with text will likely glaze over your shooting eye, and its diagrams and illustrations, useful as they are, are relegated to the book's butt end as if appended as an afterthought. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>This book is taking the trapshooting arena by storm. We knew it was a good book, but did not expect Olympic shooters and the schools that teach the Olympians would take to the book so strongly. Sales in the Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA) magazine "Trap &amp; Field" are climbing fast. <i>Shotgun Sports Magazine</i> has picked up the book. Customer complimentary letters are arriving raving about the book. "You are selling the book at too low cost. It is worth much more!" "Using your book I won the event." Now we know we have a winner. The book certainly has the inside secrets to winning high scores in trapshooting. Videotapes on shooting simply cannot compete with Russell's books. The instructions given in <i>Trap Shooting Secrets</i> is extraordinarily precise and much deeper in subject matter than the videos on the market today. Like having a coach by your side telling you what to do, how it should feel, and why you're missing specific targets, flinching, tuning up your timing, why your eye and gun holds are defective, and the list goes on. Russell knows how to communicate this highly objective trapshooting sport to get the shooter's scores up, fast. No easy feat, but Russell pulls it off.</p><h2>Mindful Silence: The Heart of Christian Contemplation</h2><p><strong>Our fast-paced lives are filled with distractions, frequently leaving us disillusioned and dissatisfied&#x2015;with ourselves, with others, and even with God.</strong> Spiritual practices that used to sustain us fall short when life circumstances bring us to the limits of our self. After many years leading an international humanitarian organization, Phileena Heuertz experienced the deconstruction of her identity, worldview, and faith. Centering prayer, a Christian expression of mindfulness, was a crucial remedy for her fragmented condition, offering a more peace-filled and purposeful life. The hallmarks of contemplative spirituality&#x2015;solitude, silence, and stillness&#x2015;have never been more important for our society: In solitude, we develop the capacity to be <em>present</em>. In silence, we cultivate the ability to <em>listen</em>. In stillness, we acquire the skill of <em>self-control</em>. Contemplative prayer helps us discern the voice of God, uncover our true self, and live a life of meaning and purpose. Filled with insights and wisdom from personal experiences, Phileena introduces us to themes and teachers of contemplative spirituality, as well as several prayer practices, and invites us to greater healing and wholeness by learning to <em>practice</em> faith through prayer. This is an opportunity to go deeper with God&#x2015;to experience the Divine and be transformed.</p><p>"Phileena writes here with such simple clarity&#x2015;and easy readability&#x2015;because she knows she does not need to prove, convict, or defend anything. <em>Mindful Silence</em> contains not just her wisdom but the spiritual wisdom of the ages that is again standing the test of time and showing itself in the fruits of <em>incarnational holiness</em>. It is the great tradition of action and contemplation again showing itself." (From the foreword by Richard Rohr)<br><br>"I'm honored to have Phileena as a teacher, and thrilled you discovered this book. If you apply the practices she teaches, you will learn how to stay engaged and involved in changing the world without descending into despondency or burning out. The contemplative tradition truly is a game changer. Once you start practicing, you will be shocked by how something so simple can have such a profound effect on your life." (From the afterword by Kirsten Powers)<br><br>"In a world marked by busyness and burnout, <em>Mindful Silence</em> offers us both an exit strategy and an invitation. Phileena Heuertz has written a must-read for anyone desiring to live a more mindful, meaningful life. Read this book and learn from one of the great spiritual guides of our time." (Jonathan Merritt, author of Learning to Speak God from Scratch, contributing writer for The Atlantic)<br><br>"Phileena's thoughtful words and practices are like water and sunlight for the soul. As I strive to find mindful silence in my own life, this gift of a book will be my trusted guide." (Ryan O'Neal, author of Sleeping at Last)<br><br>"Phileena's <em>Mindful Silence</em> is a beautiful field guide for <em>sustainable</em> social action through contemplation. A timely book that offers practical tools and powerful insights for a generation grasping for methods of self-care." (George Mekhail, executive director, Church Clarity)<br><br>"Phileena has provided an extraordinary service to Christians today who desire to become more deeply aware and spiritually mature in their daily walk. By providing the history and context of daily meditation and prayer practice cultivated in the first two thousand years of Christianity, she has filled a vast gap linking practicing the presence of the living God to this great lineage. She then makes this very practice come alive in its eternal power&#x2015;'yesterday, today, and forever.' Furthermore, Phileena very generously reveals her vulnerabilities and discoveries of the power of daily mindful contemplation within her own life. She walks the talk, and in so doing she provides a vision for how we might encounter a profound deepening within our lives too. This is a vital and necessary book, and one that I will keep beside me in my daily practice from now on." (Bobette Buster, professor of storytelling, Northeastern University, Boston, author of Do Story: How to Tell Your Story so the World Listens)Phileena Heuertz is the author of <em>Pilgrimage of a Soul</em> and a founding partner of Gravity, a Center for Contemplative Activism. For nearly twenty years she and her husband, Chris, codirected an international nonprofit. Spiritual director, yoga instructor, public speaker, retreat guide, and author, Phileena is passionate about spirituality and making the world a better place.</p><h2>Butterflies of Central &amp; Northern California: A Guide to Common &amp; Notable Species</h2><p>"Butterflies of Central and Northern California:&nbsp;This guide&#x2014;including the valley,&nbsp;foothills,&nbsp;coastal&nbsp;and metro areas&#x2014;beautifully illustrates 84 species of butterfly and nearly all of the corresponding caterpillar forms found in Central and Northern California.

In exceptionally clear prose, he demonstrates how one can reach behind the resistances of even the most repressed and fragile character types and offer them genuine, lasting change. This book is a gold mine of clinical insight.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Stanley B. Messer, PhD, Dean and Distinguished Professor, Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, Rutgers University&nbsp;</p> <p>"What a volume! Allan Abbass has masterfully integrated the work of his mentors with his own research, theory, and clinical learning into an organized and graceful approach to short-term psychotherapy for people we all see in psychotherapy. Ultimately, the book is practical and clear in its recommended psychotherapeutic approach that is supported by both theory and empirical research. It is also rich in clinical examples. Dr. Abbass&#x2019;s ideas are very helpful to practitioners of all levels.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Raymond A. Levy, PsyD, Clinical Director, Massachusetts General Hospital Psychotherapy Research Program, Harvard University"In his book,</p> <p>Reaching through Resistance: Advanced Psychotherapy Techniques, the internationally recognized master clinician and researcher Dr. Allan Abbass offers readers one of the most clearly articulated descriptions of how to conduct intensive psychotherapy. This volume presents an in-depth view of the process and techniques of psychotherapy with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. Using extensive case material and clear descriptions of the technique and process, Abbass demonstrates how to expertly transform the lives of those suffering with crippling psychological disturbances. A must- read for psychotherapists who want to improve their effectiveness and reach the most treatment refractory patients.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jeffrey J. Magnavita, PhD, ABPP, Past President, Society for the Advancement of Psychotherapy, and coeditor of the Journal of Unified</p> <p>Psychotherapy and Clinical Science&#x201c;Dr. Abbass makes an important contribution to the clinician&#x2019;s understanding of the Intensive Dynamic Short Term&nbsp; Psychotherapy (ISTDP) treatment model, through a well-written and presented book, rich with clinical material based on extensive experience and research. The book provides substantial support to the clinician engaged in treating the ever-increasing population of persons with psychosomatic symptoms.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;John E. Sarno, MD, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine, NYU School of Medicine</p> <p>&#x201c;Reaching through Resistance belongs in every psychotherapist&#x2019;s library. In a tone notable for its respect for the struggles of patients and those who try to help them, Allan Abbass systematically explores the theoretical foundations of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy, illustrates its implementation with verbatim clinical material, and reviews the extensive empirical support for this approach. Unlike therapists who are good at what they do but not so good at communicating it, Abbass is an outstanding teacher. Readers will emerge from their engagement with this masterwork not only with a greater understanding of the phenomenon of resistance but also with much more skill in addressing it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Nancy McWilliams PhD, ABPP, Rutgers Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology</p> <p>&#x201c;What occurs in the consulting room leads to change in the patient. Allan Abbass has spent twenty years developing an innovative perspective on engaging the patients, particularly difficult patients, including those who somatize and are initially not aware of their feelings and conflicts. His book is filled with wonderful examples of how to engage patients to lead them to the point where they have transformative experiences. He has recorded most of his work for many years, and the result is a treasure trove of examples, and of ideas generated from studying them. I found myself, an experienced psychoanalyst, enriched by his conceptualizations of when and how to communicate with patients, depending on a careful estimate of the state of the patients&#x2019; feelings, defenses, vulnerability, and transference. He illustrates with admirable clarity the purpose of his remarks and their immediate consequences in improving the patients&#x2019; awareness of their distress, with immediate benefit to their coping skills. Dr. Abbass&#x2019;s work springs from a profound and nuanced psychoanalytic understanding of his patients, combined with a highly innovative approach to engaging patients in corrective emotional experiences. He does not hesitate to focus in a powerful way on the feelings patients only hint at that are occurring in the consulting room. The result is astonishing: a high percentage of patients helped substantially in forty sessions or less&#x2014;and the easier ones in many fewer sessions. I came away wishing that I had read this book twenty years ago&#x2014;it would have helped me be more effective with my patients. This revolutionary book will richly repay those who devote their time to really study it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Sherwood Waldron, MD, Chair, Psychoanalytic Research&nbsp;Consortium</p> <p>&#x201c;One of the perennial problems for psychotherapists is the paradoxical situation in which the patient often resists the help offered by the therapist. In this superb new volume, Allan Abbass provides a systematic approach to dealing with that inevitable resistance. Both beginning and advanced therapists will benefit from the clinical wisdom in these pages.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Glen O. Gabbard, MD, author of Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: A Basic Text</p> <p>"This is a wonderful book on how to work to reach toward people beneath their blocks and encourage maximal treatment engagement. Filled with both theoretical innovations and a myriad of interventions you can use to help patients build psychological strength, become more relationally competent, and process difficult feelings, this book will help you be a more effective therapist.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Leslie S. Greenberg, Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus, Department of Psychology, York University</p> <p>&#x201c;Using compelling clinical illustrations, Dr. Abbass has crafted a conceptually rich, empirically robust, and technically clear guide to the practice of intensive short term psychotherapy.<br>&#x2014;Molyn Leszcz, MD, FRCPC, Professor and Interim Chair, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto</p> <p>&#x201c;In Reaching through Resistance, Dr. Allan Abbass presents a host of refined techniques designed to assess and treat the resistances that all too frequently undermine treatment efforts. Since we are still failing to help almost 50 percent of the patients who seek psychotherapy, this book is desperately needed in our field. Written in clear language, this volume is packed with research data, as well as detailed illustrations and case vignettes that bring the concepts to life. Not for the novice or the faint of heart, this is a sophisticated text for therapists who, like Abbass himself, are dedicated to going all out to help even the most troubled and treatment-resistant patients. It is ultimately a book of hope.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Patricia Coughlin, PhD, Clinical Professor, UNM School of Medicine, author of Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy, and coauthor of Lives Transformed</p> <p>&#x201c;Abbass presents in clear and jargon-free prose an approach to therapy that some may find congenial, some may find challenging, and many will experience as a highly stimulating blend of both. Richly illustrated with clinical detail, the book presents an active version of psychodynamic therapy that has been tested in the crucible of systematic research.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Paul L. Wachtel, PhD, Distinguished Professor, Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, City University of New York</p> <p>&#x201c;Allan Abbass unveils his process of conducting ISTDP by providing clear and concise guidelines that are useful to the beginner, intermediate, and master clinician. He presents vignettes from psychotherapy sessions for almost any scenario a therapist and patient might face together when working deeply with emotions. This book is a must-read for learning the art and science of ISTDP!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kristin A. R. Osborn, MA, LMHC, Harvard Medical School, and President, International Experiential Dynamic Therapy Association</p> <p>&#x201c;Many patients do not respond to an appropriate course of therapy. In this book, Dr. Allan Abbass describes a systematic way to address such cases of &#x2018;treatment resistance.&#x2019; I particularly liked the detailed case vignettes, which illustrate how to connect to the person who is suffering beneath the symptoms.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Michael Thase, MD</p> <p>&#x201c;Abbass has presented an approach to short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy that is both sophisticated and readable. The copious use of case material adds to the interest and accessibility of the book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;George Stricker, PhD, Professor, American School of Professional Psychology, Argosy University, Washington DC</p> <p>&#x201c;In&nbsp;Reaching&nbsp;through Resistance: Advanced Psychotherapy Techniques, Dr. Abbass offers a model of understanding early attachment patterns, trauma, emotions, anxiety, and bodily reactions in psychotherapy. In addition, he discusses a range of specific techniques for intervening with these issues. I believe the most significant feature of this volume is the very extensive and detailed verbatim clinical vignettes that are provided throughout as examples for the various technical discussions. In fact, I would say this book provides some of the most extensive clinical vignettes used to illustrate the many varied technical interventions presented that I have ever seen. This provides readers with a very clear understanding of how they might intervene in relation to the model of therapy being presented, which makes the book a useful resource for clinicians at any level of experience.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mark Hilsenroth, Professor, Adelphi University</p> <p>&#x201c;Dr. Allan Abbass is a giant in the field of short-term dynamic therapy, and this book is a tour de force. The combination of detailed cases and comprehensive explanatory material from a preeminent researcher and teacher makes Reaching through Resistance a must-read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Howard Schubiner, MD, author of Unlearn Your Pain; Director, Mind-Body Program, Providence Hospital, Southfield, Michigan; and Clinical Professor, Wayne State University</p> <p>&#x201c;In the tradition of Davanloo and Malan, Abbass is exploring methods to rapidly get beyond resistance to modify central conflicts. The intense focus on the current relationship between therapist and patient provides an avenue for both assessment of levels of pathology and change.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John F. Clarkin, Clinical Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College</p> <p>"In Reaching through Resistance, Allan Abbass, MD, a master clinician, provides the reader with a crisp rendition of the setting of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy and then gently rains a lovely series of illustrative examples of how an astute clinician can accurately pace the patient and use the scaffolding erected by what feels like resistance as a guide to relieving the double-binds and internal admonitions of troubled people who have been hobbled by unconscious self-protective strategies gone awry. Both newly minted and experienced ISTDP psychotherapists will find Reaching a satisfying thesaurus of what could be said in the thick of intense engagements that both respect the patient&#x2019;s adaptive defenses and helps the patient join the clinician in putting them aside and growing. I highly recommend Reaching through Resistance.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Richard A.

As a horror story, its exciting. As a parable, it s terrifying.&#39; --Empire Magazine [on World War Z] Closure, Limited is a welcome continuation to the world that Max Brooks created, and subsequently destroyed, in his previous fictional outings. Unlike so many current zombie authors, Brooks writes with an intelligence and poise that elevates his work above the rest of the genre. Brooks shows incredible knowledge of a wide variety of topics, including geography, military procedures and socio-political factors, throughout his work. The level of care and detail he puts into settings and characters make for stories that are nothing short of compelling and, perhaps even better, are entirely convincing. If George A. Romero is revered as the king of zombie films then Max Brooks must surely be dubbed the king of zombie fiction. --This Is Horror Product Description A terrifying new collection of short stories from the master of zombie fiction, Max Brooks, bestselling author of World War Z, The Zombie Survival Guide and Recorded Attacks.

She graduated from the University of Southern California and jumped into the video game industry as an artist. Now a full-time writer, she spends her spare time reading, drawing, playing games, and getting stuck in traffic. She lives in Los Angeles with one husband, one Chihuahua mix, and one Pembroke Welsh corgi.The blood underneath her nails bothered her.<br> <i> Cheap, stupid, useless gloves, </i>the girl thought in annoyance. She had even worn two layers of them tonight, but a rare errant slash from the knife had sliced through both layers, and now the blood had gotten on her hands. <i>Stupid. </i>On any other night, she would have stopped and&#x2014;carefully, methodically&#x2014;scraped the scarlet flakes out from under her nails, one line after another. But she had no time right now.<br> <i> No time, no time.</i><br> Moonlight cut across the floor of the mansion, illuminating part of the man&#x2019;s naked body. He bled strangely, the girl thought, compared with the others. The blood just pooled beneath him in a perfect circle, like a disk of smooth frosting on a cake.<br> She sighed again and stuffed her canister of red spray paint into her backpack, then grabbed a few of the rags strewn on the floor. On the wall beside her was the symbol she had just hurriedly finished drawing.<br> They had mistimed everything tonight, from the unexpected&nbsp;complications of Sir Robert Grant&#x2019;s security system at the entrance of the mansion to the surprise of him seeing them first instead of being sound asleep. They were running late. She hated running late. <br> She hurried around the bedroom chamber, gathering their tools and stuffing them all into her backpack. The moonlight illuminated her features in regular intervals as she moved past the row of win- dows. Her mother used to tell her that she had doll-like features, had been doll-like since birth&#x2014;large, liquid-dark eyes; long, long lashes; a slender nose and a rosebud of a mouth; porcelain skin.&nbsp;Her eyebrows cut straight and soft across her brow, giving her an expression that looked permanently vulnerable.<br>That was the thing about her. No one ever saw what mattered until it was too late. Until their blood stained her fingernails.<br> Her hair had come undone in all the rush, tumbling in a river of black over her shoulders, and she paused to whip it back up into a knot. No doubt a strand or two had come loose and were now ly- ing somewhere on the floor, leaving a clue for the police to follow. But no matter&#x2014;if she could just escape from here in time. What a messy getaway, so uncharacteristic of her.<br> <i> I&#x2019;m going to kill them, </i>she thought bitterly. <i>Leaving me to clean this up&#x2014;</i><br> Somewhere in the night came the wail of sirens.<br> She froze, listening intently. Her hand flew instinctively to rest on one of the knives strapped around her thigh. Then she started to run. Her boots made no sound&#x2014;she moved like a shadow, the only noise being the faint bump of her bag against her back. As she went, she pulled her black scarf up across the bottom half of her face, hiding her nose and mouth from view, and fitted her pair of dark visors over her eyes. Through the visors, the mansion trans- formed into a grid of heat signals and green lines.<br> The sirens were closing in rapidly.<br> She paused again for a breath, listening. They came from differ- ent directions&#x2014;they were going to surround her. <i>No time, no time.&nbsp;</i>She darted down the mansion&#x2019;s staircase, her figure lost entirely in the shadows, then made a sharp turn at the bottom to head not for the front door but for the cellar. The security system had been rewired to seal the front door&#x2019;s lock from the inside, but the cellar was their getaway route, all alarms cleared and window locks ready for her command.<br>As she reached the cellar, the sirens outside turned deafening.&nbsp;The police had arrived.<br> &#x201c;Window A open,&#x201d; she muttered into her mouthpiece. At the other end of the room, the rewired window unlocked with a soft, obedient click. The police would gather at the front and back doors, but they wouldn&#x2019;t think to look on the side of such a huge house yet, not without knowing there was a tiny window at ground level. She ran faster.<br> She reached the window and started pulling herself up and through it, snaking her way out in the span of a second. On the front lawn, she could hear a police officer shouting into a mega- phone, could see the heat signals of at least a dozen guards in heavy body armor crouched around the mansion&#x2019;s perimeter, their faces hidden behind helmets and their assault rifles all pointed toward the door.<br> She leaped to her feet in the darkness, pulled her visor up, and prepared to dart away.<br> A blinding light flooded over her.<br> <i> &#x201c;Hands in the air!&#x201d; </i>Several voices were shouting at her at the same time. She heard the clicks of loaded weapons, then the furi- ous barking of police dogs barely restrained by their partners. <i>&#x201c;On your knees! Now!&#x201d;</i><br> They had found her. She wanted to spit out a curse. <i>No time, no time. </i>And now it was too late. At least the others on the mission had already fled. For a fraction of a second, she thought about pull- ing out her knives and throwing herself at the closest officer, using him as a hostage. But there were far too many here, and the light had blinded her enough to make her vision inaccurate. She didn&#x2019;t have the time to make such a move without the police unleashing the dogs, and she had no desire to be mauled to death.<br> So instead, she put her hands up.<br> Officers shoved her hard to the ground; her face scraped against dirt and grass. She saw a glimpse of herself reflected in the police&#x2019;s opaque helmets, and the barrels of guns pointed directly in her face.<br> &#x201c;We got her!&#x201d; one shouted into his radio, his voice hoarse with excitement and fear. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in custody! Stand by&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <i> You got me, </i>she echoed to herself as she felt cold cuffs snap onto her wrists. But with her cheek pressed against the ground, she still allowed herself a small, mocking smile behind her scarf.<br> <i> You got me . . . for now.</i></p><h2>The Last of the Hill Farms: Echoes of Vermont&#39;s Past</h2><p>In 1968 the photographer Richard Brown fulfilled a romantic childhood dream when he moved to the Northeast Kingdom, a remote corner of Vermont just barely entering the twentieth century. There he encountered a way of life that was fast disappearing, a land of sheep, cattle, work horses, wood-burning stoves, and small family-run farms far removed from the industrial Northeast. Determined to record it before it disappeared, he saw a pastoral vision where, for the briefest interval, a window opened and the spirit of Vermont s past granite hills cleared and formed, hard lives lived and lost, struggle and endurance, a harsh land made starkly beautiful by nature and man was made palpable. He saw the land and also a people whose endless hours of backbreaking, monotonous work were spent with a quiet ferocity and who believed their age-old labors were a struggle waged against time itself labors that might just hold modernity at bay. And Brown did record it, with an 8 x 10 large plate view camera that would have been at home in the hands of Mathew Brady. Not only the hauntingly beautiful landscape but also the people who stayed and worked the stubborn hills and did so with great but fierce attachment. <br>This is, in every way, an extraordinary book, and it is no light claim to say it will stand, along with Agee s and Evans record of the dirt farmers of Alabama, and George Tice s record of the Amish of Pennsylvania, as one of the great odes to an America that has passed before our eyes almost without comment or notice. It is a valiant, indeed a brilliant, effort to make the past tangible, to bring it back to life. These images, and the brief but trenchant text that accompanies them, will stay with you for life. It is among the most beautiful and moving books this company has ever attempted.</p><p>Richard W. Brown lives in Peacham, Vermont with his wife, Susan McClellan. Brown has published several books of his work, including The Soul of Vermont, featuring more of his quintessential New England images, and My Kind of Garden, celebrating the vibrant beauty of the gardens from around the globe that Brown has worked in. His photographs have also appeared in The New York Times, Audubon, and Vermont Life.Brown is my favorite upcountry artist with a camera. His photographs have such crisp luminosity I think I would recognize them anywhere. --Maxine Kumin, New York Review of Books<br><br>His is an important vision: much of Vermont is still beautiful, but we need to see and appreciate the ideal if we are to preserve it. [His] photography expresses that ideal superlatively well. --Tom Slayton, Vermont Life<br><br>A striking book.... makes an arresting, wistful portrait of an all-but-gone way of life. --Nina MacLaughlin, The Boston Globe</p><h2>The Complete Works of Elizabeth of the Trinity, vol. 2 (featuring Her Letters from Carmel)</h2><p>Elizabeth of the Trinity (Elizabeth Catez) is a mystic of our times. She entered the Dijon Carmel in 1901 at the age of twenty-one, and died there five years later. Her biblical spirituality, based on the epistles of her "dear Saint Paul" and the mystery of the divine indwelling, has inspired countless Christians. <br>This second of three volumes of her Complete Works contains all of Elizabeth's surviving letters from Carmel. In simple and tender language, writing to friends and family, Elizabeth returns again and again to the great themes of her spirituality, the indwelling of the Trinity, silence and solitude, living by love, becoming a "praise of glory" by sharing in the dying and rising of Jesus Christ. <br><br>In his introductions and careful notes, Father Conrad DeMeester, OCD, explains the background of each of Elizabeth's letters from Carmel, most of which have never before appeared in English.</p><p></p><h2>Writing &amp; Selling Short Stories &amp; Personal Essays: The Essential Guide to Getting Your Work Published</h2><p><b>Write It Short, Sell It Now</b><br><br> Short stories and personal essays have never been hotter--or more crucial for a successful writing career.

He wished to be established worldwide--the devotion to His Holy Face. the express purpose of this devotion was to make reparation for the blasphemies and outrages of &#34;Revolutionary men&#34; (the Communists)--through whom God is allowing the world to be chastised for its unbelief--as well as for the blasphemies of the atheists and freethinkers and others, plus, for blasphemy and the profanation of Sundays by Christians. Specifically, this devotion is the divine tool given by God to defeat Communism, but it is also an instrument given to the individual devotee as a seemingly unfailing method of appealing to God in prayer--through adoration of His Holy Face and Name. Our Lord gave Sister Mary a short but powerful prayer called &#34;The Golden Arrow,&#34; by which a person can &#34;shoot directly into the Heart of God&#34; to heal the wounds inflicted on It by the malice of sinners. The editor says this devotion brought St. Therese to her great sanctity. Anyone who is searching for a spiritual method for fighting Communism and its programs and/or who is searching for a virtually infallible method of prayer will be delighted with The Golden Arrow.</p><p></p><h2>The Queen&#39;s Hat</h2><p>Queens Hat</p><p>Steve Antony is a highly talented and versatile author-illustrator.

Coupled sexual activity has become more widely available than ever. Cheap sex has been made possible by two technologies that have little to do with each other - the Pill and high-quality pornography - and its distribution made more efficient by a third technological innovation, online dating. Together, they drive down the cost of real sex, and in turn slow the development of love, make fidelity more challenging, sexual malleability more common, and have even taken a toll on men's marriageability. <br><br><em>Cheap Sex</em> takes readers on an extended tour inside the American mating market, and highlights key patterns that characterize young adults' experience today, including the timing of first sex in relationships, overlapping partners, frustrating returns on their relational investments, and a failure to link future goals like marriage with how they navigate their current relationships. Drawing upon several large nationally-representative surveys, in-person interviews with 100 men and women, and the assertions of scholars ranging from evolutionary psychologists to gender theorists, what emerges is a story about social change, technological breakthroughs, and unintended consequences. Men and women have not fundamentally changed, but their unions have. No longer playing a supporting role in relationships, sex has emerged as a central priority in relationship development and continuation. But unravel the layers, and it is obvious that the emergence of "industrial sex" is far more a reflection of men's interests than women's.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark Regnerus</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Texas, Austin.

The shift from expensive sex to cheap sex was ignited by the pill, fueled by the internet and dating sites and the ready availability of high-quality pornography. The consequences of cheap sex are profound and complex, and not all positive. Regnerus has a breezy, likable way of telling this fascinating and engaging story. A great read." <br>-- Linda Waite, Lucy Flower Professor in Urban Sociology, University of Chicago <br><p></p><br>"Too many young men in America are checked out from work, family, and community. Why are so many of our young men floundering?

Indeed, that revolution would have been inconceivable without the cumulative antecedent efforts of three great civilizations: Greek, Islamic, and Latin. With the scientific riches it derived by translation from Greco-Islamic sources in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Christian Latin civilization of Western Europe began the last leg of the intellectual journey that culminated in a scientific revolution that transformed the world. The factors that produced this unique achievement are found in the way Christianity developed in the West, and in the invention of the university in 1200. A reference for historians of science or those interested in medieval history, this volume illustrates the developments and discoveries that culminated in the Scientific Revolution.</p><p>Contrary to prevailing opinion, the roots of modern science were planted in the ancient and medieval worlds long before the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.

The discrepancies between this model and the reality it claims to address are then attributed to particular imperfections in reality itself. In Capitalism, Shaikh's approach demonstrates that most of the central propositions of economic analysis can be derived without any reference to standard devices such as hyperrationality, optimization, perfect competition, perfect information, representative agents, or so-called rational expectations. In every case, Shaikh's innovative theory is applied to modern empirical patterns and contrasted with neoclassical, Keynesian, and Post-Keynesian approaches to the same issues. Shaikh's object of analysis is the economics of capitalism, and he explores the subject in this expansive light. This is how the classical economists, as well as Keynes and Kalecki, approached the issue. Anyone interested in capitalism and economics in general can gain a wealth of knowledge from this ground-breaking text.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anwar Shaikh</strong> is Professor of Economics at the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science of the New School University and Associate Editor of the <em>Cambridge Journal of Economics</em>.

The author's scalpel eviscerates every one of these categories from the inside that is from within economic discourse and using empirical economic data. This book will resonate for a long time." <br> <br>-- Kumar David, <em>Colombo Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"Anwar Shaikh has always been an independent, free spirit. He has great economic intuition and technical skills. He has absorbed the literature of classical political economy, Marx's writings, modern economic theory, and applied work. He also is well versed in philosophy and in historical writings. His mentors include Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Keynes, Sraffa, Joan Robinson, Kalecki, Goodwin, Godley, Pasinetti and Taylor.

Harcourt, Reader in the History of Economic Theory, Emeritus, University of Cambridge and Visiting Professorial Fellow, School of Economics, UNSW Australia<p></p><br>"Anwar Shaikh's magnum opus is one of the most important works of political economy to have come out in a generation. In a time when economics is becoming ever more recondite and otherworldly, Shaikh shows that an economic theory based on real abstractions is not only necessary, but also possible. This is a work of lasting importance, not just for economists, but for anyone interested in how capitalism works." <br> <br>-- Vivek Chibber, Professor of Sociology, New York University<p></p><br>"An amazing feat. Anwar Shaikh's <em>Capitalism</em> covers exchange, production, costs, competition, money, macro-dynamics, profit, wages and trade, with theory, history and evidence complete. Deeply erudite and beautifully written, it is at once a stunning renovation of classical and Keynesian economics and a relentless demolition of sophistries. A book to savor and to teach; there hasn't one like it for 150 years." <br> <br>-- James K. Galbraith, author of <em>The End of Normal</em> and of <em>Inequality: What Everyone Needs to Know</em><p></p><br>"This new book by Anwar Shaikh is a veritable tour de force from a unique economist who skillfully links deep insights from classical economic theory with cutting edge ideas in econophysics and economic complexity to penetratingly deal with issues from microeconomic competition through macroeconomic dynamics and turbulence." <br> <br>-- J.

Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years.

Now Alan Alda has written a memoir as elegant, funny, and affecting as his greatest performances.<br><br>&#x201c;My mother didn&#x2019;t try to stab my father until I was six,&#x201d; begins Alda&#x2019;s irresistible story. The son of a popular actor and a loving but mentally ill mother, he spent his early childhood backstage in the erotic and comic world of burlesque and went on, after early struggles, to achieve extraordinary success in his profession. <br><br>Yet <b>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed </b>is not a memoir of show-business ups and downs. It is a moving and funny story of a boy growing into a man who then realizes he has only just begun to grow. <br><br>It is the story of turning points in Alda&#x2019;s life, events that would make him what he is&#x2013;if only he could survive them.<br><br>From the moment as a boy when his dead dog is returned from the taxidermist&#x2019;s shop with a hideous expression on his face, and he learns that death can&#x2019;t be undone, to the decades-long effort to find compassion for the mother he lived with but never knew, to his acceptance of his father, both personally and professionally, Alda learns the hard way that change, uncertainty, and transformation are what life is made of, and true happiness is found in embracing them.<br><br><b>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed</b>, filled with curiosity about nature, good humor, and honesty, is the crowning achievement of an actor, author, and director, but surprisingly, it is the story of a life more filled with turbulence and laughter than any Alda has ever played on the stage or screen.<b><br></b></p><p>Alan Alda's autobiography travels a path less taken. Instead of a sensationalist, name-dropping page-turner, Alda writes about his life as a memory play, an exercise in recollecting his childhood, his parents (dad Robert was a veteran on stage, film, and vaudeville), and his career. You want to know about Alda's most famous work, the eleven years on <i>M*A*S*H</i>? You have exactly 16 pages to do so, and guess what: It's one of the least entertaining parts of the book. But should fans of the award-winning actor-writer-director avoid this slim memoir? Not in the slightest. Slyly humorous and open-hearted, <i>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed</i> is a breezy, most enjoyable read. Alda's ability to recall his childhood (including backstage at raunchy vaudeville shows), school years, stage struggles and successes is as entertaining as one of his Emmy-winning teleplays. Alda is inordinately attune recalling life's crystallizing moments: when religion no longer worked for him, how something in his pocket made him forever a better actor, or his mother's painful descent into dementia. Alda's ever present humor is a great asset whether telling a charming love story on meeting his wife Arlene or a life-threatening illness in a remote part of Chile ("I am in and out of consciences, but I never take a break from the screaming. The show must go on."). Like Alda's persona, his book is more human and less flash. What would be filler in most books is often the mot entertaining and revealing here; especially Alda's dynamic relationship with his parents. Really, who else would name his memoir after an unfortunate trip to the taxidermist? The year the book was published during a revival for the 69-year-old; he was nominated for an Oscar, Emmy, and Tony in the same year. <i>--Doug Thomas</i>Alan Alda played Hawkeye Pierce for eleven years in the television series M*A*S*H and has acted in, written, and directed many feature films. He has starred often on Broadway, and his avid interest in science has led to his hosting PBS&#x2019;s Scientific American Frontiers for eleven years. He was nominated for an Academy Award in 2005 and has been nominated for thirty Emmy awards. He is married to the children&#x2019;s book author/photographer Arlene Alda. They have three grown children and seven grandchildren.</p><h2>The Hidden Nazi: The Untold Story of America&#39;s Deal with the Devil</h2><p><b>He&#x2019;s the worst Nazi war criminal you&#x2019;ve never heard of</b><br> <br> Sidekick to SS Chief Heinrich Himmler and supervisor of Nazi rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, General Hans Kammler was responsible for the construction of Hitler&#x2019;s slave labor sites and concentration camps. He personally altered the design of Auschwitz to increase crowding, ensuring that epidemic diseases would complement the work of the gas chambers.<br> <br> Why has the world forgotten this monster? Kammler was declared dead after the war. But the aide who testified to Kammler&#x2019;s supposed &#x201c;suicide&#x201d; never produced the general&#x2019;s dog tags or any other proof of death.<br> <br> Dean Reuter, Colm Lowery, and Keith Chester have spent decades on the trail of the elusive Kammler, uncovering documents unseen since the 1940s and visiting the purported site of Kammler&#x2019;s death, now in the Czech Republic.<br> <br> Their astonishing discovery: US government documents prove that Hans Kammler was in American custody for months after the war&#x2014;well after his officially declared suicide.<br> <br> And what happened to him after that? Kammler was kept out of public view, never indicted or tried, but to what end? Did he cooperate with Nuremberg prosecutors investigating Nazi war crimes? Was he protected so the United States could benefit from his intimate knowledge of the Nazi rocket program and Germany&#x2019;s secret weapons?<br> <br> <i>The Hidden Nazi </i>is true history more harrowing&#x2014;and shocking&#x2014;than the most thrilling fiction.</p><p>Dean Reuter is General Counsel of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy and a fellow at the National Security Institute at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School.

In 1999, he began researching aerial phenomena reported by Allied military pilots during the Second World War, an effort that culminated in the publication of Strange Company in 2007, the same year his focus turned to the mystery surrounding SS General Hans Kammler."It&#x2019;s strange that no one has yet written a biography of SS General Hans Kammler, one of the brutal masterminds of the German military-industrial complex and the Holocaust.&nbsp; But when you read <i>The Hidden Nazi </i>you will realize that until now no one had the knowledge, persistence, and sheer nerve that the authors brought to the job of unlocking the multiple mysteries surrounding this evil genius of the Third Reich.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s a story where <i>Schindler&#x2019;s List </i>meets <i>Doctor Strangelove</i>.&nbsp; Read it, be amazed and shocked by what Kammler did,&nbsp; and outraged by how he escaped final justice; but above all read <i>The Hidden Nazi.</i>" -- Arthur Herman, Pulitzer Prize Final historian and author of How the Scots Invented the Modern World and 1917: Lenin, Wilson, and the Birth of the New World Disorder<br><br>&#x201c;Werner von Braun called him &#x2018;the&nbsp;greatest rogue and adventurer I have ever seen.&#x2019;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert Speer damned him as &#x2018;one of Himmler&#x2019;s most brutal and most ruthless henchmen.&#x2019;&nbsp; He engineered&nbsp;the&nbsp;Holocaust, built&nbsp;theconcentration camps, and perfected&nbsp;the&nbsp;gas chambers and crematoria.&nbsp; He pioneered slave labor and masterminded rocket, fighter jet, and secret wonder-weapon production.&nbsp; And at&nbsp;the&nbsp;end of World War II he vanished without&nbsp;a&nbsp;trace. Enigmatic SS General Hans Kammler is&nbsp;the&nbsp;most diabolic&nbsp;Nazi&nbsp;you&#x2019;ve never heard of. Dean Reuter takes readers on&nbsp;a&nbsp;gripping, exciting, and suspenseful hunt in search of&nbsp;the&nbsp;mysterious war criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Hidden&nbsp;Nazi</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fascinating forensic detective story that reads like&nbsp;a&nbsp;great crime thriller. Did Kammler fake his death and survive&nbsp;the&nbsp;war? How did he escape justice? Did America strike&nbsp;a&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Devil in exchange for his secrets? Splendidly written with verve and expertise,&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Hidden&nbsp;Nazi</i>&nbsp;is storytelling at its best.&nbsp;Dean Reuter and his co-authors combine superb narrative history with&nbsp;a&nbsp;riveting personal memoir of&nbsp;the&nbsp;harrowing psychological journey into Hans Kammler&#x2019;s heart of darkness.&#x201d; -- James L.

With&nbsp;the&nbsp;invaluable scholarship and perseverance of his colleagues Colm Lowery and Keith Chester, Dean Reuter delivers&nbsp;a&nbsp;riveting mix of first-person accounts and expert analysis, from&nbsp;the&nbsp;excruciating depths of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nazi&nbsp;slave and death camps to&nbsp;the&nbsp;thrilling heights and annihilative aspirations of&nbsp;Nazi&nbsp;rocket science.

This tightly drawn portrait of SS General Hans Kammler takes&nbsp;the&nbsp;reader from his personal life as recalled in interviews with his son through his notorious work supervising construction of underground factories like Mittelwerk-Dora, where Wernher von Braun&#x2019;s V-2 rockets were built, and at Auschwitz where this ruthless&nbsp;Nazi&nbsp;perfected&nbsp;the&nbsp;gas chambers. Throughout&nbsp;the&nbsp;book Reuter tells&nbsp;a&nbsp;riveting tale of horror, ending with Kammler&#x2019;s escape from justice. But where to?

Her examples range from the classical world to the modern day, from Medusa and Athena to Theresa May and Hillary Clinton.

Alwyn Tower, an American expatriate and sometime novelist, is staying with a friend outside of Paris, when a well-heeled, itinerant Irish couple drops in&#x2014;with Lucy, their trained hawk, a restless, sullen, disturbingly totemic presence. Lunch is prepared, drink flows. A masquerade, at once harrowing and farcical, begins. <br><br>A work of classical elegance and concision, The Pilgrim Hawk stands with Faulkner&#x2019;s The Bear as one of the finest American short novels: a beautifully crafted story that is also a poignant evocation of the implacable power of love.</p><p>Glenway Wescott (1901&#x2013;1987) grew up in Wisconsin, but moved to France with his companion Monroe Wheeler in 1925. Wescott&#x2019;s early fiction, notably the stories in Goodbye, Wisconsin and the novel The Grandmothers (in which Alwyn Tower, the narrator of The Pilgrim Hawk, makes his first appearance), were set in his native Midwest. Later work included essays on political, literary, and spiritual subjects, as well as the novels The Pilgrim Hawk and Apartment in Athens (also available as an NYRB Classic).

This is a revised and expanded reprinting of the original book that was published in 1986.</p><p>Jeffrey Wolf Green has been called the founder of Evolutionary Astrology because he first started to lecture on the revolutionary astrological paradigm in 1977 after receiving a dream from the spiritual master Swami Sri Yukteswar, Paramahansa Yogananda&#x2019;s guru in which the entire paradigm of Evolutionary Astrology was conveyed to Jeffrey This was the first time in astrology&#x2019;s long history that a specific paradigm was realized that allowed for an understanding of the evolutionary progression of a Soul from life to life. Jeffrey lectured all over the world on Evolutionary Astrology from 1977 to 2001. He established Evolutionary Astrology schools in a number of countries and wrote three books on Evolutionary Astrology. The first of these, Pluto: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul, volume one was published in 1984. It has been in continuous print ever since and has become one of the all time best selling astrology books. Translations have been made into French, German, Dutch, Chinese, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Serbian, Italian, and other languages. The second volume, Pluto: The Soul&#x2019;s Evolution through Relationships was published in 1998 and has been in continuous print. A third volume, Essays in Evolutionary Astrology: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul, was published in 2010. Essays was compiled by his daughter Deva Green from transcriptions of workshops Jeffrey gave over the years. It covers topics that are part of Jeffrey&#x2019;s Evolutionary Astrology paradigm that were either not covered in depth, or in some cases, at all in his original two volumes. Deva has also published many other books based on his teachings over the years, compiled from different sources, on Neptune, Uranus, Relationships, Medical Astrology, and so on. Since starting his original Pluto School in 1994, Jeffrey had many EA students, a number of whom are now professional EA astrologers. He personally counseled over 30,000 clients in his lengthy career. This exposure to so many Souls from so many different backgrounds and orientations allowed him to come to the deepest possible understandings of the nature of the Soul. He communicated these insights through all of his teachings. In 2008 his daughter Deva Green, took over her father&#x2019;s work. She established the Jeffrey Wolf Green School of Evolutionary Astrology website, and created the EA School&#x2019;s Evolutionary Astrology Council who assist Deva with the School&#x2019;s mission of disseminating Jeffrey&#x2019;s original work around the planet.</p><h2>Sister Mother Husband Dog: (Etc.)</h2><p>Bestselling author Delia Ephron shares a deeply personal collection of stories and essays, anchored by a loving remembrance of her sister Nora.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Sister Mother Husband Dog, </i>Delia Ephron brings her trademark wit and effervescent prose to a series of autobiographical essays about life, love, sisterhood, movies, and family.

There is, on television, a series called Girls about young women floundering in their twenties. It is written, directed, and acted by Lena Dunham, who is not on a walkabout. Nevertheless, she captures the very special misery of being in your twenties. Of being clueless, desperate, lost. Looking for love, settling for crazy. Grabbing at solutions because they are solutions, just not to your problem. Being in your twenties has changed a lot since I was in my twenties, but it is still a time when everything awful that happens is awful in a romantic way, even if you don&#x2019;t admit it (and you can&#x2019;t admit it because then you would be less important in the tragedy you&#x2019;re starring in, your own life) . . . because in your twenties you know, even if you don&#x2019;t admit this, either, even if this is buried deep in your subconscious, that you can waste an entire decade and still have a life.</p><p>College did not prepare me for anything. At Barnard I majored in European history because my roommate, brilliant at history, always accurately guessed the exam essay questions. That is really the only reason. It was the easy way out. As I write this, I am struck by how shallow I was. A truly empty-headed thing. I was quick with a comeback, but a comeback is most emphatically not knowledge. Also when I was at Barnard, a European history major, unlike a political science or English major, was not required to take comprehensives, a general examination in your major at the end of your senior year. I knew I would flunk comprehensives. I retained nothing. </p><p>Recently I found a paper I wrote in college. &#x201c;The Causes of the Franco-Prussian War.&#x201d; I got a B on it. I wondered if I pulled an all-nighter writing it. If I took NoDoz. If Susan, my roommate, told me the causes and I parroted her. Today all I know about this war is who fought it, and that is only because of the war&#x2019;s name. I wasn't interested in European history. It didn't cross my mind&#x2014;this is so basic, it&#x2019;s embarrassing&#x2014;that I was supposed to major in something I was interested in. </p><p>This is probably my mother&#x2019;s fault. Isn't everything your mother&#x2019;s fault in some way? At this point in life I forgive her everything and besides am deeply grateful to her, but she picked all my high school classes: two years of Latin, three of French, four of English and history, journalism as an elective. No science except what was absolutely required. Or art. She was raising writers. She had stern notions of what constituted an education for her daughters. </p><p>However, no one ever asked me&#x2014;no parent, no teacher, no high school or college counselor&#x2014;&#x201c;What are you interested in studying?&#x201d; I didn't connect interest with school. Or passion with school. In high school, the only class I liked was journalism. Not because I was writing. Because, for some reason, at Beverly Hills High School&#x2014;a privileged place if ever there was, with its very own oil well polluting the environment and a basketball court whose floor parted in the center (if someone pushed a button or pulled a crank or lever) and retracted under bleachers to reveal a swimming pool&#x2014;at this very fancy public school there was a linotype machine. </p><p>We&#x2019;re talking pre&#x2013;computer age here&#x2014;whenever you read a book, a newspaper, a magazine, it was because the words were set with actual lead type. The linotype man would type my stories. The machine would convert my words to metal type, slugs of which, as I recall, came sliding down a shoot. Lead type is heavy. If you carried a lot of type in your shoulder bag&#x2014;not that you would&#x2014;it would break your shoulder. How wonderful that it was heavy, that I could hold words in my hand and they had weight. I was the front-page editor, and Thursday nights I would go to the typesetting building next to the gym, collect my type, and arrange the page as I had designed it. After tightening the frame to hold the type in position, I would ink the whole shebang, place paper on top, and roll a heavy roller over it to get an impression. Then I would proofread my page, replace typos with new type, and take a final proof. It was the most fun in the world. It was craft satisfaction. Craft satisfaction comes from actually making something with your hands. It terms of education, it is practically obsolete. </p><p>In college the only thing that interested me was dating. Being in love. In the library I had a reward system: ten minutes of studying, ten of daydreaming. Mostly about whatever boy I was obsessed with, reliving the last weekend, planning the next. I have to say college completely cooperated here. Classes provided no competition for my yearnings. I took a course in plays, a foray out of history. We had to read a play a night. Strindberg, Ibsen, O&#x2019;Casey, O&#x2019;Neill, Wilder, went whizzing by. It&#x2019;s hard to read a play. Seriously hard to understand what is happening, what the playwright intends. Reading one a night was ludicrous. I still have trouble reading them, still have trouble now and then figuring out what the hell is going on. The final exam was a slew of multiple-choice questions. There was one about pork chops, which went something like this: &#x201c;In which of these plays did pork chops figure?&#x201d; All I knew about pork chops was, at my house, they came breaded with applesauce on the side. I had no idea what play featured pork chops. I still don&#x2019;t, but I remember the question. It was ridiculous. I retained ridiculous. </p><p>Modern Poetry was similar. Wednesday Wallace Stevens, Friday Ezra Pound. A person could spend a lifetime trying to understand Stevens, and Pound is mind-bendingly obtuse. In Medieval History, there was so much required reading, all in books the professor had written, that no one could accomplish it, especially someone like me who had required daydreaming. I did love Art History. I have never met anyone who didn't. I still remember the rush I got from correctly identifying a geometric shape at the bottom right corner of a Picasso as a cornucopia. </p><p>I hope kids are smarter about college now and colleges are smarter about educating them. I am longing to believe it (especially given how much college costs). When I was there, the sheer volume of homework made learning or getting excited about learning a steep uphill climb. My husband insists, even though I don&#x2019;t admit it, that I was learning&#x2014;to think better, research, organize information, meet the demands of a deadline. At Connecticut College, where I spent two years before Barnard in small classes, that might have been true. But still I was wasting my parents&#x2019; money. Wasting it big-time. It was, in retrospect, the life of a spoiled girl. </p><p>Getting married was a big part of my fantasy life. There was a card game called Old Maid that we played as kids. Each card had a partner card except one. The loser would be stuck with a card depicting a funny-looking gray-haired woman with glasses and a hat. The hat was especially sad&#x2014;sort of a pillbox with a fake flower in it. Old Maid the card game struck terror in me. I was a superstitious kid, and getting left with that card seemed prophetic. There was also a song that freaked me out: &#x201c;What Are You Doing New Year&#x2019;s Eve?&#x201d; Ella Fitzgerald sang it (quite inappropriately, in my opinion) on a record of Christmas songs. When the record (what we now call vinyl, and why do we, it&#x2019;s so pretentious) got to that song, I would pick up the needle, very carefully so as not to scratch the record, and skip it to the next song. I couldn't bear to listen to it if I didn't have a date. Not having a date on New Year&#x2019;s Eve was like being an old maid. It was being an old maid every year. </p><p>This absurd hysteria about New Year&#x2019;s Eve stayed with me for much longer than I&#x2019;d like to admit. Whenever I read about how people in their twenties don&#x2019;t date anymore, they travel in hoards, it makes me happy. Maybe this group thing has taken the sting out of New Year&#x2019;s Eve. </p><p>So, on the one hand, my mother was drilling me daily from the time I could hold a spoon: &#x201c;You will have a career like me. You will work. You will be a writer. You will leave Los Angeles. You will go to New York City. You will work. Career, career, career.&#x201d; On the other hand&#x2014;driving me as powerfully with no help from her&#x2014;was simply wanting love. </p><p>I blame this on the movies. I blame it on one movie in particular: Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. </p><p>There were lots of messages keeping women domestic then, every message actually&#x2014;lack of opportunity, advertising, the women&#x2019;s magazines like McCall&#x2019;s, La�dies&#x2019; Home Journal, Redbook, Seventeen, which&nbsp; glorified the stay-at-home wife and which I devoured each month when they arrived at our house. But really the thing counteracting my mother&#x2019;s teaching, trumping it, was a singing and dancing 1950s romantic comedy starring pert blond Jane Powell. </p><p>In Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Jane Powell is the cook at a roadhouse in a wild west town when How�ard Keel, big and handsome, rides in, shaves while he sings, samples her stew, and proposes. This is my favorite line: When he asks for catsup, she replies, &#x201c;My stew can stand on its own feet.&#x201d; She agrees to marry him&#x2014;it&#x2019;s love at first sight for her&#x2014;and he takes her to his ranch in the backwoods, where she discovers he has six uncivilized (but sweet) brothers. It turns out she was looking for love, but he was looking for a servant. Boy, did I want to be that servant. Lucky Jane. She gets to rise at dawn, make flapjacks, eggs, bacon, biscuits, and coffee for eight (including her), wash their filthy clothes, and teach them to dance. Once cleaned up, they are gorgeous, and then&#x2014; excuse me for telling the plot of this movie I love as much as I love my dog&#x2014;she takes them to a barn raising where they meet other town girls and fall in love. Those girls, however, are promised to less attractive town boys who wear stiff suits with dorky stitching on the lapels, while the brothers wear britches with wide leather belts and cool blousy shirts. The barn-raising musical number, choreographed by Michael Kidd, a dance-off between the townies and the brothers, is the greatest dance sequence in a movie ever. In my opinion. </p><p>The brothers return to the backwoods heartsick, so heartsick they can barely lift a pitchfork of straw. At Howard Keel&#x2019;s urging&#x2014;stirring them to action as only a song can&#x2014;they return one night and kidnap the women. A cute kidnapping, if you consider putting a bag over the head of someone you love cute. My favorite kidnap-cute from the film is not the bag-over-the-head, but this: When one young woman sets a hot pie on the windowsill to cool, she is whisked right out the window. I don&#x2019;t want to tell you the end of this movie in case you haven&#x2019;t seen it, although given the title, you can probably guess. </p><p>The movie came out when I was ten, and by the time I was twenty, I had seen it sixteen times. The last viewing was in Madrid. There were no subtitles, but it didn't matter because I knew it by heart. </p><p>It is the only movie of which I have counted my viewings. All sixteen were in one movie theater or another. I can&#x2019;t emphasize how important this is. Watching a movie in a theater is to enter a dream state. In The Purple Rose of Cairo, Woody Allen perfectly captures the transporting power of film. When Mia Farrow goes to the movies and is captivated by the glamorous world so different from the dismal small life she is living, her yearning is so great that the hero on-screen is pulled right out of his cinematic reality into her prosaic one. </p><p>I was young and vulnerable and innocent when I first saw Seven Brides. I took my heart into that theater and lost it. </p><p>Loving a movie is not about logic. If a movie &#x201c;gets&#x201d; me, I forgive it anything. If it doesn't, I sit there cold, critical, poking holes. I&#x2019;m amazed that many sane people claim that violent movies don&#x2019;t make people more violent. This seems the delusional, self-serving justification of people who make violent movies. If violence excites you, a violent movie will nurture that. It must. Movies invite you to dream, change your dreams, become your dreams. Recently I was reading in the New York Times about Aton Edwards, a leader of the prepper movement. Preppers are people who spend a lot of time preparing to survive a catastrophe, natural or terrorist, that results in an all systems failure (banks, phones, food, transportation, breathing, whatever). Mr. Edwards said he went to see the movie Deliverance when he was ten years old . . . went in, according to the article, a fairly regular kid and emerged a Prepper. </p><p>&#x201c;Ten&#x201d; did pop out at me. I was ten when Seven Brides overwhelmed, seduced, and altered my life. He was ten when he saw Deliverance. I asked a developmental psychologist about ten. A big year, it turns out, when children first begin to think for themselves, entertaining ideas different from what their parents tell them. Budding sexuality, too. First feelings. Deliverance has a male rape in it&#x2014;no wonder Edwards emerged a Prepper. I&#x2019;m surprised more men didn't, but then it had an R rating. Ten-year-old Aton Edwards never should have been in that theater. </p><p>I do wonder if you spend your life preparing for disaster if you are disappointed if a disaster doesn't happen. If you are hoping for a disaster so you haven&#x2019;t wasted your time or can prove you&#x2019;re right or can finally have the adventure you crave or get to watch everyone else go down while you inflate your raft, load it up with gas masks and cans of tuna fish, and sail off Manhattan island (row actually&#x2014;row across the Hudson to New Jersey, are they kidding?). </p><p>The impact of Seven Brides was undoubtedly greater because I saw it in a theater as opposed to on a DVD, as opposed to lying on a bed where I can say to whomever I&#x2019;m watching with, &#x201c;Would you please pause it? I want to get an apple.&#x201d; </p><p>As for romantic films being denigrated as chick flicks, consider this. My adolescent yearnings aside, when you&#x2019;re looking for love, aspiring to love, hoping for love, dreaming of love, movies are where it seems possible. When you&#x2019;re past the &#x201c;falling&#x201d; phase and in the calmer yet more complicated &#x201c;being in love&#x201d; (assuming you&#x2019;re committed to it), the only place you ever fall in love again is at the movies. </p><p>That is no small thing. </p><p>I blame my entire twenties walkabout on Seven Brides. On hoping some man was going to whisk me out a window and in the spring we would be singing with little baby lambs on our laps. (That happens, too, in Seven Brides. Oh God, I really do hope I haven&#x2019;t ruined the movie for you. I haven&#x2019;t even mentioned the fantastic sequence when the lonely brothers in the dead of winter sing &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lonesome polecat.&#x201d; There, I've mentioned it. Although there is no ruining this movie. Trust a woman who has now seen it thirty times or more. I did eventually stop counting.) </p><p>When Howard Keel didn't show up, I pretended he did. I married the first man who asked me and began living someone else&#x2019;s life. Not Jane Powell&#x2019;s, but sort of. Marrying this man for misguided reasons wasn't the nicest thing to do to him, but, like Howard Keel, he had ulterior motives. Not wanting to be alone, I think. Besides, as you will soon see, while I wasted six years of his life, he wanted to wreck mine completely. </p><p>He was a professor at Brown University. Given how little I liked college, this was even weirder&#x2014;I was a faculty wife l...</p></p><h2>I&#39;ll Fly Away: Further Testimonies from the Women of York Prison</h2><p><p> For several years, Wally Lamb, the author of two of the most beloved novels of our time, has run a writing workshop at the York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's only maximum-security prison for women. Writing, Lamb discovered, was a way for these women to face their fears and failures and begin to imagine better lives. <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>, a collection of their essays, was published in 2003 to great critical acclaim. With <i>I'll Fly Away</i>, Lamb offers readers a new volume of intimate pieces from the York workshop. Startling, heartbreaking, and inspiring, these stories are as varied as the individuals who wrote them, but each illuminates an important core truth: that a life <i>can</i> be altered through self-awareness and the power of the written word. </p></p><p><p>Wally Lamb is the author of five <em>New York Times</em> bestselling novels: <em>She&#x2019;s Come Undone</em>, <em>I Know This Much Is True</em>, <em>The Hour I First Believed</em>, <em>Wishin&#x2019; and Hopin&#x2019;</em>, and <em>We Are Water</em>.

Whitaker, MD, trained as a surgeon, has practiced medicine for over 25 years. Thousands of patients from all over the country have visited his Whitaker Wellness Institute in Newport Beach, CA. Founder and past president of the American Preventive Medical Association, he is regarded as one of the country&#39;s premier exponents of preventive medicine. Dr. Whitaker is the author of six books.Physician Whitaker (Reversing Heart Disease offers some sound advice that is, unfortunately, shrouded by specious assertions, such as his belief that diabetes is a reversible condition and not a chronic disease. He promotes a sensible low-fat, high-carbohydrate and high-fiber diet (recipes included) and an exercise program, but his claims that diet and exercise will help "hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of diabetics in this country to become drug free" should be taken with more than a grain of salt. As he admits in the book, persons with Type 1 diabeteswhose diabetes emerged because of a lack of insulin in the body rather than the inability of the body to use it effectively"will almost always require insulin injections," although the amount may be reduced by following his regimen. He cautions readers to use this program under a doctor's care but repetitiously attacks his colleagues for their ignorance of nutrition and readiness to prescribe medications, and dredges up George Washington's unnecessary death by bleeding therapy at the hands of a doctor. He attributes eye damage to aggressive insulin treatment, which should also cause a stir in the medical community.

But when we got to Queens, in New York City, in the United States of America, I became dumb, just because I couldn&#x2019;t speak English.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I got put in the dumb class in fifth grade at P.S. 117. It&#x2019;s the class for the <i>bobos</i>, the kids who failed at math and read�ing. Also in it are the kids the teachers call &#x201c;delinquents.&#x201d; They come to school late and talk back and are always chew�ing gum. Even though they&#x2019;re considered the bad kids, most of them are nice to me. &#x201c;Here, Ruthie, have some Chiclets!&#x201d; they whisper and pass me a handful.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We aren&#x2019;t supposed to chew gum in school, so we hold the Chiclets in our mouths until we go outside for recess. Then we chew the Chiclets to death and stick the gook on the bottom of our desks when we come back inside.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the kids know I&#x2019;m in this class because I&#x2019;m from another country, not because I really belong there. Or maybe I do belong there? It&#x2019;s been eight months since school started and our teacher promised I wouldn&#x2019;t be in the class for long. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not dumb. I am not dumb. I am not dumb . . .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time I worked up the courage to raise my hand in class was a few weeks after we had arrived from Cuba and I was wearing flip-flops instead of shoes and socks like the other kids. But when our teacher, Mrs. Sarota, called on me to answer the math problem, I didn&#x2019;t have the words to say the number in English.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, Ruth?&#x201d; she asked, staring down at my bare feet. &#x201c;Do you know the answer or not?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I froze and a few kids laughed at me. But not Ramu.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;s not dumb either. Ramu is in our class because he&#x2019;s also from a different country. He comes from India and was raised there by his grandmother, who only speaks a language called Bengali. His parents came to New York first, and after they made enough money, they brought Ramu and his little brother, Avik, here.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramu has picked up English faster than I have because his parents know English and force him to speak it at home. Mine are always yelling, <i>&#x201c;�Habla en espa�ol!&#x201d; </i>Especially Mami, who can understand a little English, but is usually too embarrassed to try to speak it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramu is skinny and bows his head when anyone talks to him. I&#x2019;m his only friend and that&#x2019;s because he lives down the hall from us on the sixth floor of our apartment building. Ramu brings Avik to school and I bring my brother, Izzie. Our little brothers are in the same kindergarten class. But af�ter school Ramu and Avik rush straight home. Mrs. Sharma doesn&#x2019;t let them play with the other children.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their apartment smells different from ours. I get whiffs of it whenever we stumble into each other on the way to school. Today when Ramu and Avik stepped into the hall, Izzie and I were waiting for the elevator, and I asked, &#x201c;What is that perfume?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my mother&#x2019;s curry,&#x201d; Ramu says.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s curry?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A spice. It makes everything taste good, even cauliflower.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, it is. And my mother burns sandalwood incense. She says it&#x2019;s good for meditation and the spirits like it too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Spirits?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;People who used to be alive, when they&#x2019;re not alive anymore, become spirits. My grandmother says they are all around us. We can&#x2019;t see them but they watch over us. Of course, spirits don&#x2019;t eat, but they can smell fragrant things like curry and incense.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During lunch at the cafeteria, Ramu offers me something from his lunch box, a pastry filled with mashed potatoes his mother made.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a samosa,&#x201d; Ramu tells me. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;ll find it too spicy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some kids at the table pretend to hold their noses. One says, &#x201c;It smells like sweaty armpits!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No it doesn&#x2019;t!&#x201d; I shout back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take a slow first bite. It tastes like a <i>papa rellena</i>, a crispy stuffed potato my nanny Caro made for me as a snack in Cuba. Eating Ramu&#x2019;s samosa makes me feel like Caro and Cuba aren&#x2019;t so far away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s real good! Thanks, Ramu.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramu gives me a shy smile. &#x201c;Very glad you like it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beg Mami to make <i>pastelitos de guayaba </i>after Izzie and I get home. The following day, I give Ramu one of the sweet pastries at lunch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The filling is guava fruit. I hope you&#x2019;ll like it,&#x201d; I tell him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramu eats it slowly without saying a word. When he&#x2019;s done, he finally says, &#x201c;I like guavas. We have them in India too,&#x201d; and I sigh.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And do you have mangos in India?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh yes, drippy sweet mangos.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just like in Cuba!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t just miss the mangos,&#x201d; Ramu says. &#x201c;I miss being able to go outside and play with friends. My mother worries too much about us. She doesn&#x2019;t let us do anything by our�selves.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I know what you mean. In Cuba, even when I was five years old, my mother used to let me take a taxi all by myself to go visit my aunt Zoila, who used to sew pretty dresses for me. Can you imagine?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, here everything is different,&#x201d; he says, with a faraway look in his eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But maybe one day we&#x2019;ll both get to taste mangos in India and Cuba!&#x201d; I say, trying to cheer him up.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, Ruthie, I like that you have such an imagination!&#x201d;<br><br>Ramu and I sit together every afternoon after lunch period so we can practice our English.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our favorite story is &#x201c;The Princess Who Could Not Cry,&#x201d; about a princess who is placed under an evil spell and forgets how to cry. She laughs at everything, even sad things. When they toss away all the toys she loves from the tallest tower of the castle, she laughs, even though she feels terrible.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little ragged girl arrives and announces, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come to help the princess cry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The queen tells her, &#x201c;Promise me you won&#x2019;t hurt my daughter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little ragged girl curtsies and replies, &#x201c;I promise, Your Majesty, I will bring no harm upon your daughter. I just want to help her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She goes into a room with the princess and draws two on�ions out of her bag.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s peel these onions,&#x201d; the little ragged girl tells the princess.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the little ragged girl and the princess pull apart the layers of the onions, the tears start pouring from both their eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is how the princess learns to cry!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evil spell is broken, and the little ragged girl and her poor mother are given a nice house next to the castle where they live happily ever after.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That is the best story!&#x201d; I say to Ramu as we finish read�ing aloud.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s very fine,&#x201d; he replies. &#x201c;Very fine indeed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ramu, you always talk such a fancy English.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Like they do in England. It&#x2019;s the Queen&#x2019;s English, you see.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes! And now we live in Queens!&#x201d; I say, joking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very charming, Ruthie. That&#x2019;s almost funny.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s ask Mrs. Sarota to test us!&#x201d; I tell Ramu. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But will you ask her, Ruthie, please? You see, in India, we don&#x2019;t talk to the teacher unless the teacher talks to us.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay, I will ask. I&#x2019;m not afraid of the teacher.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Sarota comes to our desk and I say, &#x201c;Me and Ramu are ready to switch into the smart class.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In English, we say &#x2018;Ramu and I.&#x2019; &#x2018;Me and Ramu&#x2019; is in�correct.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t lose my courage. I repeat, &#x201c;Ramu and I are ready to switch into the smart class.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is that so, young lady? Both of you?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, Mrs. Sarota,&#x201d; I reply, trying to keep from giggling. Mrs. Sarota wears her hair in a big bird nest on top of her head and today it&#x2019;s lopsided. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very well, young lady. Which of you can spell the word &#x2018;commiserate&#x2019;?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramu gets it wrong, but I get it right&#x2014;two <i>M</i>s and only one <i>S</i>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn&#x2019;t ask, but I also know what the word means. To &#x201c;commiserate&#x201d; is to feel sorry for somebody else&#x2019;s bad luck. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very good, Ruth. I agree you&#x2019;re ready to be promoted. But remember to say &#x2018;yes&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;yeah.&#x2019; On Monday, you can join the regular fifth-grade class.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see Ramu gazing sadly toward the floor. It&#x2019;s not fair. He&#x2019;s much better at English than I am. He talks like the Queen of England herself. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Please, Mrs. Sarota, can you give Ramu another chance? Give him a harder word and see if he can spell it. Please.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Sarota&#x2019;s eyes suddenly sparkle. &#x201c;You said the magic word, &#x2018;please.&#x2019; Ramu, can you spell the word &#x2018;souvenir&#x2019;?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have gotten that word wrong, but Ramu knows how to spell it right. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Excellent job, Ramu. You are also promoted,&#x201d; Mrs. Sarota says. &#x201c;On Monday, you and Ruth can join the regular fifth-grade class.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mrs. Sarota, you are very kind,&#x201d; Ramu says in his most polite voice. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramu gives me one of his shy smiles and that is enough of a thank-you for me. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I wasn&#x2019;t dumb. I knew Ramu wasn&#x2019;t dumb either. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s Friday. After the weekend, when we come back to school, both of us will be in our new class with the smart kids. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yippee! <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I collect my schoolbooks and say good-bye to the other kids. One of them looks sad that I&#x2019;m leaving and gives me some Chiclets. &#x201c;You may need them!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish all the kids could come with Ramu and me to the smart class. I don&#x2019;t think any of them are really dumb. They just find school boring. They&#x2019;d rather play all day. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a chorus they call out, &#x201c;Bye, Ruthie! Bye!

Woody was apparently too busy for introductions. My instructions were to run out of a building, through a crowd, and into a strange car. When Woody called 'Action,' I opened the car door, jumped in, and landed smack on William Powell's lap. He looked up nonchalantly: 'Miss Loy, I presume?' I said, 'Mr. Powell?' And that's how I met the man who would be my partner in fourteen films.&#x201d; &#x2013; Myrna LoyMovie stars are revered for their ability to captivate audiences, and Hollywood began to flourish before the onset of television, allowing movies to enjoy relatively uncontested supremacy over American entertainment. The popularity of various actors would thus extend well beyond the success of any of their individual films, reflecting their much broader cultural significance as monuments of Hollywood during its Golden Age. <br>In the 1920s, the burgeoning movie industry was starting to come into its own, and while older silent film stars like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton reached the peak of Hollywood, some actors born near the beginning of the 20th century were ready to capitalize. While actors like Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant remain household names, and actresses like Greta Garbo are still widely remembered, few had careers that enjoyed the success of William Powell.<br>In a career spanning several decades, Powell would receive three Oscar nominations for Best Actor for critically acclaimed movies, so it is somewhat ironic that he is mostly remembered today for his association with the more famous Myrna Loy. Together, they starred in 14 films, including the 1934 box office hit, The Thin Man. <br>One thing that helped Powell&#x2019;s career along in the old days when Hollywood would only cast white actors in major roles, no matter what the nationality of the character was supposed to be, were his dark good looks. In pointing this out, a contemporary profile of Powell explained, &#x201c;Many people imagine that William Powell has a foreign look. His first big stage success, his first big picture roles, were all in foreign parts &#x2014; Spanish, Italian, Cuban. As a matter of fact, he is American to the core. Perhaps that look is his heritage from a paternal grandfather named Brady. The black Irish fit into any nationality. There is, too, a good strong strain of Holland Dutch, and a bit of French and English.&#x201d;<br>William Powell: The Life and Legacy of One of Early Hollywood&#x2019;s Most Acclaimed Actors chronicles the long life and diverse career of Powell on and off the screen.

Her career as an actress was launched at the same time, and before her death in 1968, she had appeared on many theater stages, in more than 60 films, on radio, in USO tours, as a model, and on television. The tall, stylish actress had a husky voice and dark beauty that was striking on film. Despite her financial success, relaxed morals, and life as a socialite, the millionaire actress shunned luxuries such as limousines and sprawling estates popular among Hollywood elite. The actress, who insisted she wanted to be forgotten, left behind scrapbooks, boxes of memorabilia and detailed diaries. These rich resources help provide an exhaustive look at the life of one of Hollywood&#39;s most intriguing early stars. Francis&#39; biography is the heart of this book, beginning with her family background and her upbringing by a vaudevillian actress mother. The story of her extensive career and never-ending romantic pursuits is peppered with comments from the media and her own diaries, and supplemented with ample photographs.

Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald. Shortly after, Oswald himself was killed. These events led many to believe there was a far greater plan at work, with a secret cabal of powerful men manipulating the public and shaping US policies both at home and abroad for their own interests.<br> &nbsp;<br> But no one could imagine how right they were.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beneath the orderly fa�ade of the American government, there lies a complex network, only partly structural, linking Wall Street influence, corrupt bureaucracy, and the military-industrial complex. Here lies the true power of the American empire. This behind-the-scenes web is unelected, unaccountable, and immune to popular resistance. Peter Dale Scott calls this entity the deep state, and he has made it his life&#x2019;s work to write the history of those who manipulate our government from the shadows. Since the aftermath of World War II, the deep state&#x2019;s power has grown unchecked, and nowhere has it been more apparent than that day at Dealey Plaza.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this landmark volume, Scott traces how culpable elements in the CIA and FBI helped prepare for the assassination, and how the deep state continues to influence our politics today.<br> &nbsp;<br> As timely and important as ever in the current chaotic political climate, <i>Dallas &#x2019;63</i> is a reality-shattering, frightening expos� not of those who govern us&#x2014;but of <i>those who</i><i> govern those who govern us.</i><br> &nbsp;</p><p>Peter Dale Scott, a former Canadian diplomat and professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, is a poet, writer, and researcher. His diplomatic service from 1957 to 1961 included two years of work at UN conferences and the UN General Assembly, as well as two years in Poland. In addition to teaching poetry and medieval literature at Berkeley, he was a cofounder of the university&#x2019;s Peace &amp; Conflict Studies (PACS) program.<br><br> Scott&#x2019;s most recent political books are <i>The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America</i> (2007); <i>The War Conspiracy: JFK, 9/11, and the Deep Politics of War </i>(2008);<i> American War Machine: Deep Politics, the CIA Global Drug Connection, and the Road to Afghanistan </i>(2010); and <i>The American Deep State: Wall Street, Big Oil, and the Attack on U.S. Democracy</i> (2014).<br><br> Scott&#x2019;s books have been translated into six languages, and his articles and poems have been translated into twenty. The former US poet laureate Robert Hass has written that, &#x201c;<i>Coming to Jakarta</i> is the most important political poem to appear in the English language in a very long time.&#x201d; In 2002, Dale Scott received the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry.<br><br> Scott&#x2019;s website is www.peterdalescott.net and his Facebook page is www.facebook.com/peter.d.scott.9.<b>Praise for Peter Dale Scott</b><br> &#x201c;[A] staggeringly well-researched and intelligent overview not only of the JFK assassination but also of the rise of forces undermining American democracy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A kind of Rosetta stone for cracking open the deepest darkness in American politics.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> on <i>Deep Politics and the Death of JFK</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> on <i>Deep Politics and the Death of JFK</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;May well be the most thoughtful and serious-minded of the 2,500 titles on the subject published over the years.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Toronto Star </i>on <i>Deep Politics and the Death of JFK</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Peter Dale Scott is our most provocative scholar of American power. Scott picks up where the pioneering C. Wright Mills left off, shining a light on the dark labyrinth of power&#x2014;a shadow world that has only grown more arrogant and wedded to state violence since the days of the &#x2018;power elite&#x2019; and the &#x2018;military-industrial complex.&#x2019; There is no way to understand how power really operates without daring to follow Scott&#x2019;s illuminating path.&#x201d; &#x2014;David Talbot, <i>Salon</i>, on<i> The American Deep State</i><br><br> &#x201c;Breaks new ground on the deceptions that covered up anti-Castro assassination plots and protected the operation to assassinate JFK .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an essential read.&#x201d; &#x2014;John Newman, author of <i><i>Oswald and the CIA</i><br> &nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;An incandescent affirmation of Peter Dale Scott&#x2019;s stature as our sharpest and most discerning historian whose works expose and document the intricacies, concealed alliances, and underlying continuities that exist between a public state which is bound by the checks and balances of constitutional authority, and a deep state which is neither influenced nor informed by constitutional constraints.

He emphasizes the path to freedom from emotional and psychological suffering and provides insight into the fact that taking ourselves seriously causes unnecessary hardship.<br>Ajahn Chah influenced a generation of Western teachers: Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzberg, Sylvia Boorstein, Joseph Goldstein, and many other Western Buddhist teachers were at one time his students. Anyone who has attended a retreat led by one of these teachers, or read one of their books, will be familiar with this master's name and reputation as one of the great Buddhist teachers of this century.</p><p>Deep in a Thai forest lived "a pot-bellied monk who looked more like a bullfrog than a saint" and yet whose no-nonsense brand of Buddhist meditation has profoundly influenced many of the West's most popular teachers. He was called Ajahn Chah. In <i>Being Dharma</i> Paul Breiter, Ajahn Chah's longtime interpreter, brings us his collection of Ajahn Chah's dharma talks. Here we find a teacher who prefers the concrete to the abstract and practice to theory. The practice is training the mind, and the goal is achieving a constant mindfulness that will end suffering and yield peace and compassion at every moment. Achievements, he says, come gradually with relentless training in meditation and practicing the moral precepts. Ajahn Chah's plain teachings and simple, straightforward examples cross language barriers easily as he instructs us on the fundamentals of impermanence and nonattachment. In <i>Being Dharma</i> Paul Breiter allows us to soak up the simple but profound wisdom of this master to the masters. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Ajahn Chah (1919 1992) was a beloved Thai Buddhist master whose teachings were refreshingly uncompromising in their clarity and certainty&#x2014;the certainty of a meditator who has achieved deep understanding of the Buddha's teachings. He was an important influence and spiritual mentor for a generation of American Buddhist teachers.</p><h2>Financial Vipers of Venice: Alchemical Money, Magical Physics, and Banking in the Middle Ages and Renaissance</h2><p><p>In this sequel to Joseph P. Farrell's <i>Babylon's Banksters</i>, the banksters have moved from Mesopotamia via Rome to Venice. There, they have manipulated popes and bullion prices, clipped coins, sacked Constantinople, destroyed rival Florence, waged war, burned "heretics," and suppressed hidden secrets threatening their financial supremacy . . . until Giordano Bruno and Christopher Columbus broke the banking cartel's control of information and bullion.</p><p>We might wonder&#x2014;with some justification&#x2014;how an excursion into such magical mediaeval matters could possibly shed light on the contemporary debate on finance, commerce, credit, and debt taking place around the world.</p><p>As will be seen in these pages, the modern global economy, with its bonds, annuities, bills of exchange, alchemical paper "fiat money," bullion, wage-slavery, national debts, private central banking, stock brokerages, and commodities exchanges, in a sense began in the Middle Ages, for all these institutions began for quite perceptible and specific reasons during that time.</p><p>The centerpiece in this debate is of course money: what, and who, does it really represent? And how did it manage to begin as a purely metaphysical phenomenon, with deep ties to a cosmological and indeed topological and alchemical metaphor of the physical medium, thence to transmute itself into the conception that money is bullion, and thence once again to transmute itself back into a purely metaphysical construct of credit and debt denominated on tokens of paper?</p></p><p></p><h2>When Moses Meets Aaron: Staffing And Supervision In Large Congregations</h2><p>With the number of large congregations rising in the U.S., these congregations are increasingly dependent upon a greater number of staff to meet the needs of their diverse collection of members. As leaders of multi-staff teams, senior clergy must play the dual role of both Moses and Aaron--both visionary and detail-oriented leader--in order for their large congregations to thrive. They need to be skilled with the tools of human resource management, while at the same time setting a vision and inspiring both staff and congregation. Unfortunately, until now there have been few resources for senior clergy who lead multi-staff teams. Working without adequate models and tools, senior clergy of large congregations often find themselves with passionate, dedicated staff members who are moving in different directions, competing over limited resources and attention. They end up with questions of how to evaluate the performance of staff and direct their efforts. They find themselves using time, attention, and resources to care for staff rather than using staff as a resource to care for the mission of the congregation. Longtime Alban senior consultant Gil Rendle and Alban senior consultant Susan Beaumont have developed When Moses Meets Aaron to help clergy responsible for several-member staff teams navigate these unknown waters. They have taken the best of human resource practices and immersed them in a congregational context, providing a comprehensive manual for supervising, motivating, and coordinating staff teams. Rendle and Beaumont give both detailed and big picture guidance on hiring, job descriptions, supervision, performance evaluation, staff-team design, difficult staff behavior, and more. Their combined experience in consulting and training with staff and leaders of large congregations proves invaluable in this manual for today&#39;s leadership demands.</p><p>Gil Rendle serves as senior consultant with The Texas Methodist Foundation in Austin, Texas, and as an independent consultant working with denominational leaders on issues of change and leadership. Prior to this position he served the Alban Institute as an author, seminar leader, and senior consultant. He is the author of seven earlier books including Journey in the Wilderness: New Life for Mainline Churches and Back to Zero: The Search to Rediscover the Methodist Movement.<br> <br>Susan Beaumont is a congregational consultant, coach and spiritual director. Susan worked as a Senior Consultant with the Alban Institute before establishing her own practice (http://www.susanbeaumont.com). Susan's practice specializes in the unique leadership dynamics of large congregations, particularly in the areas of staff team and board development, strategic planning, pastoral transition, and size transition. She is the author of Inside the Large Congregation. Susan is an ordained clergy leader in the American Baptist Churches, USA.<br>Pastors and lay leaders know that hiring, supervising, and evaluating staff are among the trickiest, and often the most poorly handled, tasks facing congregations. But take heart: help is on the way. When Moses Meets Aaron is both instruction manual and tool-kit&#x2014;everything you need to develop good and faithful personnel practices in the church. (Martin B. Copenhaver, president, Andover Newton Theological School)<br><br>This book is a welcome addition to any pastor&#x2019;s library as a resource for board leadership, employee relations, and ministry success. Churches will find a compelling toolbox in this book and will be guided by excellence in a long-awaited tool all churches deserve: good management. (Pierce W.

Having spent thirty-six years as a Presbyterian pastor fighting against the easy access to firearms, one of which took the life of a friend, he uses his unique experience and his biblical and theological understanding to graphically portray the impact guns have on our society. He documents how Americans have been deceived into believing that the tools of violence, whether they take the form of advanced military technology or a handgun in the bedside stand, will provide security. He closes with a wake-up call to the faith community, which he says is America&#39;s best hope to unmask the extremism of the Gun Empire.</p><p>James E. Atwood is Pastor Emeritus of the Trinity Presbyterian Church of Arlington, Virginia, from which he retired in 1999. He lives in Springfield, Virginia. He is presently the Chairperson of Heeding God&#39;s Call of Greater Washington, a faith-based ecumenical movement that encourages gun shops to adopt a code of conduct that deters illegal purchasing and the trafficking of handguns."Atwood knows that guns are not just weapons, but symbols, and not only symbols, but idols that demand enormous sacrifice in American lives. This book gets at both the depth and meaning of this on-going tragedy. As a gifted organizer and thinker, Atwood then unveils the inspiring theological bases of an awakening to gun violence [prevention] that has already begun in some cities and congregations."<br>--Christian Iosso, Coordinator of Advisory Committee on Social Witness Policy<br><br>"When it comes to tackling the plague of gun violence in the U.S., no one 'walks the walk' with more integrity than Atwood. He has devoted his life to saving lives from gun violence by increasing awareness and challenging popular myths about guns. He now gives us a much needed theological undergirding for our work to end the violence."<br>--John W. Wimberly Jr., Pastor of Western Presbyterian Church<br><br>"Gun violence destroys families everyday in America. Atwood presciently shows how our weak gun laws result from treating guns as if they were religious idols. By unpacking the theological significance of policies that allow for unfettered access to firearms, he makes a compelling argument that people of faith have a religious and moral duty to fight for stronger gun laws."<br>--Joshua Horwitz, Executive Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence<br><br>"Atwood's fervent account of the multiple costs of gun violence and the need to restrain it is of urgent and timely importance. This book is a challenge to Christians to lead the way in unmasking the peculiar American obsession with guns. It illuminates the origins of that obsession and recounts a distressing record of statistics and broken laws, all in a compelling theological framework."<br>--David Little, Harvard Divinity School<br><br>"This is the book I've been waiting for. Atwood's analysis is deeply theological, and I hope it will bring conversations in our churches about idolatry, faithfulness, and the violence that has become so interwoven into our culture. Read this book for an exploration of your own acquiescence to the gun culture, and then study it with your book club or church group to begin planning the revolution that will stand up to the gun industry."<br>--Rick Ufford-Chase, Executive Director of Presbyterian Peace Fellowship<br><br>"Atwood writes with righteous purpose and theological wisdom. All people of faith should read and embrace his admonition to the American faith community to heed God's call to save the lives of our sisters, brothers, and children by renouncing the idolatry of guns and joining together in a faith-based movement to end the uniquely and devastatingly American regime of gun violence."<br>--Bryan Miller, Executive Director of Heeding God's Call<br><br>"With searing insight, prophetic passion, and deep wisdom, Jim Atwood challenges our country's relationship with guns, which he rightly describes as idolatry. Americans have come to accept unacceptable numbers of gun deaths--far higher than those of other democratic societies. Atwood explores the reasons creating the grim statistics, from economic and cultural, to theological and spiritual. Written with piercing clarity, this book troubles the soul and moves us to cry, 'Enough!'"<br>--Katie Day, Charles A.

Dissemination and implementation research (D&amp;I) is the study of how scientific advances can be implemented into everyday life, and understanding how it works has never been more important for students and professionals across the scientific, academic, and governmental communities. <br><br><em>Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health</em> is a practical guide to making research more consequential, a collection assembled and written by today's leading D&amp;I researchers.

Compared to European cities, those in the United States are characterized by lower densities and greater distances; neat, geometric layouts; an abundance of green space; a greater level of social segregation reflected in space; and&#x2015;perhaps most noticeably&#x2015;a greater share of individual, single-family detached housing. In <i>Zoned in the USA</i>, Sonia A. Hirt argues that zoning laws are among the important but understudied reasons for the cross-continental differences.</p><p>Hirt shows that rather than being imported from Europe, U.S. municipal zoning law was in fact an institution that quickly developed its own, distinctly American profile. A distinct spatial culture of individualism&#x2015;founded on an ideal of separate, single-family residences apart from the dirt and turmoil of industrial and agricultural production&#x2015;has driven much of municipal regulation, defined land-use, and, ultimately, shaped American life. Hirt explores municipal zoning from a comparative and international perspective, drawing on archival resources and contemporary land-use laws from England, Germany, France, Australia, Russia, Canada, and Japan to challenge assumptions about American cities and the laws that guide them.</p></p><p>Sonia A. Hirt is Professor and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs in the College of Architecture and Urban Studies, Virginia Tech. She is the author of<i> Iron Curtains: Gates, Suburbs and Privatization of Space in the Post-socialist City</i> and coeditor most recently of <i>The Urban Wisdom of Jane Jacobs</i>.<p>"This very important book represents a significant contribution to the literature on U.S. land-use regulatory practices. The comparative framework of <i>Zoned in the USA</i> is distinctive. It allows Sonia Hirt to identify the uniqueness of U.S. zoning in its origins, its institutional arrangement, and its physical outcome. I know of no other work that as insightfully compares U.S. practices to the international experience. Hirt shows that the U.S. approach to land-use regulation represents a historically conditioned and highly consequential set of policy decisions that constitute a fundamental break with processes of urbanization globally and throughout history."</p> (Jonathan Levine, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, University of Michigan, author of <i>Zoned Out: Regulation, Markets, and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land Use</i>)<br><br><p>"Sonia Hirt contends that America's approach to land-use control, which puts such a premium on insulating single-family homes from all other uses, is unique from most other places in the western world. American exceptionalism is effectively demonstrated in this comparative analysis. Hirt is careful not to overly judge the American system and suggests a paradox regarding our demonstrated proclivity to value individualism (as symbolized by the single-family detached house) and yet support a land-use system that so rigidly regulates how we shape our human settlements. Her sources are rich, and her access to non-U.S. sources is extremely impressive."</p> (Christopher Silver, Dean and Professor, College of Design, Construction, and Planning, University of Florida, author of <i>Planning the Megacity: Jakarta in the Twentieth Century</i>)</p><h2>All Aunt Hagar&#39;s Children: Stories</h2><p><p> Three years after the publication of his much-heralded, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, <i>The Known World</i>, Edward P. Jones returned with an elegiac, luminous masterpiece, <i>All Aunt Hagar's Children</i>. In these fourteen sweeping and sublime stories, Jones resurrects the minor characters in his first award-winning story collection, <i>Lost in the City</i>. The result is vintage Jones: powerful, magisterial tales that showcase his ability to probe the complexities and tenaciousness of the human spirit. </p> <p> <i>All Aunt Hagar's Children</i> is filled with people who call Washington, D.C., home. Yet it is the city's ordinary citizens, not its power brokers, who most concern Jones. Here, everyday people who thought the values of the South would sustain them in the North find "that the cohesion born and nurtured in the south would be but memory in less than two generations." </p></p><p><p>Edward P. Jones, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize, for fiction, the National Book Critics Circle award, the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and the Lannan Literary Award for <em>The Known World;</em> he also received a MacArthur Fellowship in 2004. His first collection of stories, <em>Lost in the City,</em> won the PEN/Hemingway Award and was short listed for the National Book Award. His second collection, <em>All Aunt Hagar&#x2019;s Children, </em>was a finalist for the Pen/Faulkner Award. He has been an instructor of fiction writing at a range of universities, including Princeton. He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>Peter Francis James's melodious baritone is beautifully suited to this fine collection of short stories by Edward P. Jones, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his earlier novel, THE KNOWN WORLD. The stories are predominantly about Southerners moving North to Washington, D.C., in the early and mid-twentieth century; although set relatively recently, they are replete with passages that seem as if they should begin "once upon a time." Accordingly, James speaks with a warmth and rhythm that invite listeners to settle back and listen. His pacing, particularly his use of telling pauses, is adept. And he shades characters with just enough personality to color the already-vivid scenes. A.C.S.

His first thought was that the volcano that loomed over Fever Island was erupting. But one by one, massive sections of the ceiling of the passageway that led to the entrance of the temple complex slid open. Boulders rained down.</p><p>Brice Torrence&#x2019;s voice echoed from the far end of the corridor near the entrance.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Slater, get out of there. Hurry. Something terrible is happening.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Slater was already moving. He did not waste time collecting the lanterns, his sketches or the camera. He ran to the doorway of the chamber but when he looked into the long, twisting stone corridor that led to the entrance he saw at once that it was too late to escape.</p><p>More sections of the corridor ceiling slid open as he watched. Countless tons of the terrible hail crashed into the passage. The stones piled up rapidly, filling the tunnel. He knew that if he tried to make a dash to safety he would be crushed beneath the falling rocks. He had no choice but to turn back and retreat deeper into the unexplored maze of the tomb caverns.</p><p>He rushed across the chamber, grabbed the lanterns and headed into the nearest adjoining passage. The corridor twisted away into dense, unexplored night but no boulders rained down from above.</p><p>He ran a short distance into the passage and stopped, aware that if he went deeper he would soon get lost. He and Brice had not even begun to chart the complex of burial caves carved into the base of the volcano.</p><p>He hunkered down against one wall, bracing himself. The glary light of the lantern illuminated an eerie painting, a scene depicting an ancient, catastrophic eruption of a volcano. Destruction rained down on an elegant city built of white marble. It was, Slater thought, far too close to what was happening at that moment.</p><p>Clouds of dust wafted down the tunnel. He covered his mouth and nose with his shirt.</p><p>There was nothing for it but to wait for the thundering to stop. Dread swirled like acid through his veins. At any moment the ceiling of the cavern in which he was sheltering might give way, burying him in the rubble. At least it would all be over in seconds, he thought. He was not sure he wanted to contemplate his immediate future if he did survive. For whatever time he had left he would be trapped in a brilliantly engineered maze.</p><p>The storm of rock and stone seemed to go on forever. But eventually the temple caves fell silent. It was another eternity before the dust finally settled.</p><p>Warily, he got to his feet. He stood still for a moment, listening to the shattering silence, waiting for his pulse to calm. After a while he went to look out into the vaulted chamber in which he had been standing when the rock trap released its deadly cargo. Small stones littered the floor of the room but it appeared that they had bounced and rolled into the chamber from the massive heap that now sealed the passage that led back to the entrance.</p><p>He had survived, which meant that he was now entombed alive.</p><p>He began to calculate his odds in a surprisingly academic fashion. He concluded that he was still too shaken to absorb the enormity of his predicament.</p><p>There was no reason for Brice and the rest of the expedition team to believe that he had survived; nothing they could do to save him, even if they had some hope. Fever Island was an uninhabited chunk of volcanic rock covered in unexplored jungle. It was situated a few thousand miles from civilization.</p><p>The only resources available were limited to the supplies and equipment on board the ship anchored in the island&#x2019;s small, natural harbor. There was no way to acquire the machinery and the manpower required to remove the vast quantity of rock that clogged the temple entrance.</p><p>Brice would consult with the ship&#x2019;s captain, Slater thought. They would conclude that he was dead and they would pray that was true because there was nothing they could do to save him.</p><p>He put out one of the lanterns to conserve the fuel. Holding aloft the second lantern, he started walking into the maze. There were, he decided, only two possibilities. The first&#x2014;and most likely&#x2014;was that he would wander in the temple complex until he died. He could only hope that death would come before the never-ending darkness drove him mad.</p><p>The second possibility&#x2014;extremely remote&#x2014;was that he might blunder into a passage that would take him outside into the sunlight. But even if he was so fortunate it was unlikely that he would be able to find his way back to the ship before it sailed. They had been running low on supplies when they finally found the damned island after being thrown off course by a violent storm. The captain was convinced that another tempest was on the way. He would want to start the return trip to London as soon as possible. He had to think of his crew and the other men on the expedition.</p><p>Slater knew that if he managed to escape the maze he would find himself stranded on an island that was not a regular port of call for any known vessel. It could be years before another ship arrived, if ever.</p><p>He walked on into the night-bound caverns, his only guide the temple paintings left behind by the artists of an ancient civilization that had long ago been buried beneath rivers of molten lava.</p><p>He did not know exactly when he began to understand the meaning of the paintings, if, indeed, he actually did perceive the intent of the stories. He reminded himself that there was a very good possibility that he was already slipping into madness. The eternal darkness and the mesmerizing artwork were disorienting. A man in his situation could easily begin to hallucinate.</p><p>But eventually he thought he detected three distinct legends. He stopped when it dawned on him that each tale was a different path into the maze. One series of paintings depicted a tale of war. The second was a story of vengeance.</p><p>In the end he chose the third legend.</p><p>He never knew how long he walked or how far. At times he stopped, exhausted, and sank into a slumber that was splintered with images from the wall paintings that were his only guide. Occasionally he stumbled across small underground streams. He stopped to drink deeply from them. He tried to make the cheese and bread in his pack last but eventually they were gone.</p><p>He kept walking because there was nothing else to do. To stop would be an act of total surrender.</p><p>In the end when he staggered out of the caverns into a stone circle illuminated with daylight he almost continued walking because he was certain that he was hallucinating.</p><p><i>Sunlight.</i></p><p>Some part of his mind registered the reality of what he was seeing.</p><p>In disbelief he looked up and saw that the hot, tropical sunshine was slanting through an opening in the rocks. A series of steep stone steps had been cut into the rock. A long black cord dangled from the opening.</p><p>Calling on the last of his reserves, he grasped the rope and tested it to make certain it would hold his weight. When he was satisfied that it was secure he started up the ancient staircase, using the rope as a handrail.</p><p>He reached the opening, scrambled out of the temple caves and collapsed on the stone floor of an open-air temple. He had been so long in the shadows that he had to close his eyes against the brilliant sunlight.</p><p>Somewhere nearby a gong boomed. The sound echoed endlessly through the jungle.</p><p>He was not alone on the island.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>A YEAR LATER another ship dropped anchor in the small harbor. Slater was on board when it sailed. But he was not the same man that he had been when he arrived on Fever Island.</p><p>Over the course of the next several years he became a legend in certain circles. When he finally returned to London he discovered the great curse that befalls all legends: There is no place to call home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ONE</p><p>I can&#x2019;t believe Anne is gone.&#x201d; Matty Bingham blotted her eyes with a handkerchief. &#x201c;She was always so spirited. So charming. So full of life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she was.&#x201d; Ursula Kern tightened her grip on the umbrella and watched the gravediggers dump great clods of earth on the coffin. &#x201c;She was a woman of the modern age.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And an excellent secretary.&#x201d; Matty tucked her handkerchief into her satchel. &#x201c;A credit to the agency.&#x201d;</p><p>Matty was in her mid-thirties, a spinster without family or connections. Like the other women who came to work at the Kern Secretarial Agency, she had abandoned any hope of marriage and a family of her own. Like Anne and the others, she had seized the promise that Ursula offered&#x2014;a respectable career as a professional secretary, a field that was finally opening up to women.</p><p>The day was appropriately funereal in tone&#x2014;a depressing shade of gray with a steady drizzle of rain. Ursula and Matty were the only mourners present at the graveside. Anne had died alone. No family had come forward to claim the body. Ursula had paid for the funeral. It was, she thought, not just her responsibility as Anne&#x2019;s employer and sole heir, but also a final act of friendship.</p><p>A great emptiness welled up inside her. Anne Clifton had been her closest friend for the past two years. They had bonded over the things they had in common&#x2014;a lack of family and haunting pasts that they had very carefully buried.</p><p>Anne might have possessed a few faults&#x2014;some of the other secretaries at the agency had considered her a fast woman&#x2014;but Ursula knew there had always been a distinct twist of admiration in the remarks. Anne&#x2019;s bold determination to carve her own path in life against all odds made her the very model of the Modern Woman.</p><p>When the coffin vanished beneath the growing mound of dirt, Ursula and Matty turned and walked back across the cemetery.</p><p>&#x201c;It was kind of you to pay for Anne&#x2019;s funeral,&#x201d; Matty said.</p><p>Ursula went through the wrought-iron gates. &#x201c;It was the least I could do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will miss her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So will I,&#x201d; Ursula said.</p><p><i>Who will pay for my funeral when the time comes?</i> she wondered.</p><p>&#x201c;Anne did not seem like the type to take her own life,&#x201d; Matty said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, she did not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>URSULA DINED IN SOLITUDE, as she usually did. When the meal was concluded she went into her small, cozy study.</p><p>The housekeeper bustled into the room to light the fire.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs. Dunstan,&#x201d; Ursula said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re certain you&#x2019;re all right, then?&#x201d; Mrs. Dunstan asked gently. &#x201c;I know you considered Miss Clifton a friend. Hard to lose a connection of that sort. Lost a few friends, myself, over the years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite all right,&#x201d; Ursula said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to sort through Miss Clifton&#x2019;s things and make an inventory. Then I&#x2019;ll go to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Dunstan went quietly out into the hall and closed the door. Ursula waited a moment and then she poured herself a stiff shot of brandy. The fiery spirits took off some of the chill she had been feeling since Anne&#x2019;s death.</p><p>After a while she crossed the room to the trunk that held Anne&#x2019;s things.</p><p>One by one she removed the items that had aroused in her a deep sense of unease&#x2014;an empty perfume bottle, a small velvet bag containing a few pieces of jewelry, Anne&#x2019;s stenography notebook and two packets of seeds. Taken individually, each was easily explained. But as a group they raised disturbing questions.</p><p>Three days earlier, when Anne&#x2019;s housekeeper had discovered the body of her employer, she had immediately sent for Ursula. There had been no one else to summon. Initially, Ursula had been unable to accept the notion that Anne had either died of natural causes or taken her own life. She had called in the police. They had immediately concluded that there was no sign of foul play.</p><p>But Anne had left a note. Ursula had found it crumpled on the floor beside the body. To most people the marks made in pencil would have looked like random scribbles. Anne, however, was a skilled stenographer who had been trained in the Pitman method. As was the case with many professional secretaries, she had gone on to develop her own personal version of coded writing.</p><p>The note was a message, and Ursula knew it had been intended for her. Anne had been well aware that no one else could decipher her unique stenography.</p><p>Behind water closet.</p><p>Ursula sat down at her desk and drank a little more brandy while she contemplated the items. After a while, she pushed the empty perfume bottle aside. She had found it on Anne&#x2019;s little writing desk, not with the other things. It was unlike Anne not to have mentioned the purchase of new perfume but aside from that there did not appear to be anything mysterious about it.</p><p>The notebook, the jewelry pouch and the seeds, however, were a very different matter. Why had Anne hidden all three items behind the water closet?</p><p>After a while she opened the stenography notebook and began to read. Transcribing Anne&#x2019;s cryptic shorthand was slow-going but two hours later she knew that she had been wrong about one thing that afternoon. Paying for the funeral was not to be her last act of friendship.</p><p>There was one more thing she could do for Anne&#x2014;find her killer.</p></p><h2>Everfair: A Novel (Everfair, 1)</h2><p><p><b>From noted short story writer Nisi Shawl comes a brilliant alternate-history novel set in the Belgian Congo</b>.</p><p>What if the African natives developed steam power ahead of their colonial oppressors?

For the Finns this was a chance to right the wrongs of the Winter War, and having reached suitable defensive positions, the army was ordered to halt. Years of uneasy trench warfare followed, known as the Continuation War, during which Finland desperately sought a way out, German dreams of victory were dashed, and the Soviet Union built the strongest army in the world. </p><p>In the summer of 1944, the whole might of the Red Army was launched against the Finnish defenses on the narrow Karelian Isthmus. Over several weeks of fierce fighting, the Finns managed to halt the Soviet assault. With Stalin forced to divert his armies to the race to Berlin, an armistice agreement was reached, the harsh terms of which forced the Finns to take on their erstwhile German allies in Lapland. Featuring rare photographs and first-hand accounts, this second volume of a two-part study, publishing in paperback for the first time, details the high price Finland had to pay to retain its independence and freedom.</p></p><p><p>After graduating college, <b>Vesa Nenye</b> followed his family's illustrious military tradition and served his country, Finland, as a Tank Commander and an Arms &amp; Munitions NCO.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This is much more than a book for priests. Based on his earlier studies of the life of Christ, Sheen envisions the priest as a man sacrificing himself in the prolongation of Christ&#39;s incarnation. Whereas pagan religions offered sacrifices to the Gods, the priest is himself both priest and victim, as he sacrifices himself, as the ancient priests sacrificed animals and other creatures. A classic description of the significance of the priesthood.</p><p></p><h2>Elvis: A King in the Making</h2><p><b>This volume contains a true treasure trove of spontaneous and completely unrehearsed photographs of The King of Rock n&nbsp;Roll.&nbsp;<i>Elvis</i>&nbsp;both famous pictures&nbsp;and some that have never before been published.</b><br><br> In 1956, a twenty-one-year-old Elvis Presley was at the<b> beginning of his remarkable and unparalleled career</b> and <b>photographer Alfred Wertheimer was asked</b> by Presley&#x2019;s new label, RCA Victor, to photograph the rising star. With <b>unimpeded </b>access to the young performer, Wertheimer was able to capture the<b> unguarded and everyday moments</b> in Elvis' life during that crucial year.&nbsp;<br><br> This was&nbsp;a year that took Presley&nbsp;from Tupelo, Mississippi<b> to the silver screen</b>, and to the verge of <b>international </b>stardom and to his coronation as "<b>The King of Rock 'n' Roll</b>.&#x201d; As<b> Alfred Wertheimer photographed Elvis during 1956</b>, and again in <b>1958</b>, he created<b> classic images</b> that are <b>spontaneous</b>, <b>unrehearsed </b>and completely <b>without artifice</b>.<br><br> Wertheimer&#x2019;s photographs of Elvis are extraordinary and he appears almost <b>ethereal</b>, whether<b> reading a newspaper</b> while waiting for a cab, or washing his hands during one of his many<b> train trips</b>. After 1958 and Elvis&#x2019; induction into the army, the world seemingly forgot about<b> Wertheimer&#x2019;s magical photographs</b> - for nineteen years - until Aug 16, 1977, the day Elvis died and <i>Time</i> Magazine called. &#x201c;The phone hasn&#x2019;t really stopped ringing in the last thirty years,&#x201d; observes Wertheimer.<br><br> Many of the photographs in this visual treasury are<b> previously unpublished</b> and some have become <b>almost </b>as famous as the man himself.</p><p><p><b>Alfred Wertheimer </b>was born in Germany in 1930, came to America and settled in Brooklyn as a young boy. He took an early interest in architecture and design, which led him to Cooper Union, from which he graduated in 1951. In the spring of 1956, a series of commercial assignments for RCA Records led to a shoot of a newly signed singer named Elvis Presley. Instantly impressed, Wertheimer devoted four months of his own time to intensely shadow the young star. The result would be the most intimate and candid look at the future legend ever recorded.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Peter Guralnick</b> is an award-winning biographer of Elvis Presley and author of&nbsp;Last Train to Memphis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Careless Love.

Delightful reading for all ages. Describes much of what is known about St. Benedict, including the founding of the Benedictine order.</p><p>Pope St. Gregory I ('The Great') was born circa 540 to a noble and wealthy Roman family, with the birth name of Gregorius. After enjoying the monastic lifestyle, which he possessed a deep respect for, Gregory was elected pope in 590, though he mourned the loss of the happiness he had enjoyed as a monk. During his term of papacy he was instrumental in various liturgical reforms, and also authored such works as <i>The Life of St. Benedict</i>, <i>Dialogues</i>, <i>Commentary on Job</i>, and <i>The Rule for Pastors</i>. Pope Gregory the Great died on the twelfth of March, 604.</p><h2>Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men into Whiners, Weenies and Wimps</h2><p><b>As seen on Tucker Carlson Tonight and The Ingraham Angle on Fox News.</b><br> <br><b>As heard on Mark Levin and Glenn Beck radio.</b><br> <br> The Black middle class&#x2014;saviors of the American way.<br><br><i>Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men into Whiners, Weenies and Wimps </i>documents the role of the 21 white, self-avowed socialist, atheist and&nbsp; Marxist founders of the NAACP and their impact on the Black community&#x2019;s present status at the top of our nations misery index.&nbsp; It highlights the decades of anti-Black legislation supported by liberal black leaders who prioritized class over race in their zeal for the promises of socialism. Their anti-Black legislation, dating back with the 1932 Davis-Bacon Act, continues today to suppress inter-community Black capitalism, federal construction related Black employment, work and job experience for Black teenagers, quality education access for urban black children, and the role of black men as leaders within the family unit.<br> <br> <i>Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men into Whiners, Weenies and Wimps</i> highlights the strategy, used in 1910, to inject the atheist ideology of socialism into a once enterprising, self-sufficient, competitive and proud Christian black community. A portion of that community, the conservative Black middle class, is positioned to pull our nation back from this abyss.&nbsp;<br> <br> Americans can ensure that the century-long sacrifice of lost hopes, dreams and lives made by the proud, courageous, patriotic, capitalist, Christianbased, self-sufficient, education-seeking Black community of the early 1900s was not in vain&#x2014;but only if we choose to learn lessons from those&nbsp;past Black generations.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>A former Super Bowl champion, Burgess spent his childhood growing up in the Deep South during a time when the barriers of segregation were being torn down.

Introduction by Jesse Sheidlower; illustrations by Arnold Roth.<br></p><p>Those who find their equanimity challenged by the lucubrations of William F. Buckley Jr. will surely see their torpor evanesce after reading <i>The Lexicon</i>. Monosyllabically: if it bugs you when you read words you don't know, this book will help. Buckley is renowned (and sometimes unfairly reviled) for his extensive working vocabulary, from which he unerringly picks the right word for every occasion. <i>The Lexicon</i> is a pocket guide to his esoterica with several hundred entries, each concisely defined and accompanied by an example of its use from his writings, which is quite a handy feature. For example: <blockquote> lucubrate (verb) <i>To discourse learnedly in writing</i>.<br> Under the Eisenhower program, one could lucubrate over constitutional rights and freedoms and forever abandon captured American soldiers. </blockquote> It is a sign of his skill as a writer that the book may be read for pleasure. Illustrations by Arnold Roth add to the enjoyment, making this the perfect introduction to Buckleyian erudition. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>William F.

But with the growth in the number of directors has come an increased need to train their supervisors. <br> <br> This collection of essays is one of the first books in the field that help with the training of supervisors. Written by spiritual directors who have years of experience in supervision between them, this book engages some of the leading voices in the field in an exploration of a wide variety of issues, including: gender and sexuality; ethical dilemmas; working with diverse racial ethnic constituents; working with the differently abled; the parameters of supervision; the supervision of beginning directors, and more. <br> <br> An excellent textbook for those who feel called to the role of supervisor, as well as an important book for those who are already practicing in the field.</p><p>Mary Rose Bumpus is a Sister of Mercy of the Cincinnati Regional Community who has worked in the area of spiritual direction for twenty-five years.

Collects <i>DC Comics: Bombshells</i> #1-6.</p><p>Marguerite Bennett is comic book writer currently working on <i>DC Bombshells</i>, Marvel's <i>A-Force</i> and <i>1602: Witch Hunter Angela.</i>Serving as a companion piece to DC&#39;s line of collectible &#34;Bombshells&#34; statues, this series reimagines several of the publisher&#39;s heroines with a 1940s pinup aesthetic and launches them into the fray of early WWII. The retro result manages to avoid the huge potential for offense thanks to the lively story from Bennett (Angela: Queen of Hel). Amazon princess Wonder Woman, Atlantean queen Mera, Supergirl, Star-Girl, Zatanna, and others appear in what amounts to a &#34;gathering of the team&#34; opening arc, and it&#39;s pretty entertaining. The story opens with lovely art by Marguerite Sauvage (Faith) that perfectly captures the vintage feel the series strives for; the remaining chapters intersperse Sauvage&#39;s work with that of several other serviceable illustrators. This entertaining female-centric adventure comes out of the gate quite strong but loses some visual steam after the first chapter.

With many subchapters and cross references, it can be consulted for a specific problem or read at length.</p><p>Helen Fitzgerald&nbsp;is an author and lecturer certified in thanatology by the Association for Death Education and Counseling. For twenty-three years she was the coordinator of the Grief Program for Mental Health Services in Fairfax County, Virginia, where she conducted many groups for adults, as well as for grieving children ranging from preschool age through the high school years. In July 2000 she retired from that position and then served as the director of training for the American Hospice Foundation. Her books include&nbsp;<i>The Grieving Child, The Mourning Handbook,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Grieving Teen.</i><b><i>Chapter 1</i></b><br><br><b>FACTS ABOUT GRIEF</b><br><br>Let's begin by providing you with some basic information that you need to have about this little-understood human experience.<br><br><b>1.1 Definitions<br><br><i>Grief</i></b><br><br>If you are grieving, you are familiar with the feeling, but what is grief exactly? <i>Webster's New World Dictionary</i> gives as its primary definition "intense emotional suffering caused by loss, disaster, misfortune, etc.; acute sorrow; deep sadness."<br><br>Grief is the emotion experienced by Darlene, a young client of mine who had flown home for a surprise visit on her mother's birthday, only to learn at the airport that her mother had died a few hours earlier. Darlene's sudden feelings of disbelief, panic, and anger are part of what we call grief, and it is what you may be experiencing right now.<br><br><b><i>Mourning</i></b><br><br>Mourning, on the other hand, is defined by the same dictionary as "the actions or feelings of someone who mourns; specifically, the expression of grief at someone's death." The key words here are <i>actions</i> and <i>expression.</i> When an uncle told Darlene of her mother's death, she fell into his arms, weeping hysterically. She was <i>mourning</i> her mother's death. Her mourning continued as she <i>cried</i> with her family, <i>expressed</i> her anger, <i>discharged</i> her feelings of regret for not coming sooner, and <i>took part</i> in the wake and funeral. When you are expressing your grief, you are mourning.<br><br>Although grief is most commonly associated with the death of a loved one, it can be experienced whenever there is an important loss in one's life, such as the loss of eyesight or hearing, a sharp decline in one's health, marital separation and divorce, or the loss of one's job. In all these cases mourning is an appropriate and often necessary response. If you have suffered a particularly severe loss, you may need to mourn just as much as someone who has lost a loved one. While this book focuses on the grief following a death, it can be helpful in dealing with other losses as well.<br><br><b>1.2 When Does Grief Begin?</b><br><br>Grief can begin whenever there is a loss or a perception of impending loss, but the three most common occasions are:<br><br>a. the time of diagnosis of a terminal illness,<br><br>b. the time of death, and<br><br>c. the time of learning about the death of a loved one.<br><br>When the doctor says, "I'm sorry, but your husband has brain cancer and it is inoperable," the hope for a cure changes to the prospect of impending death for the loved one, and the emotions of grief are likely to begin.<br><br>Sometimes grief begins at the time of death. At the moment that one's wife slumps over in her chair, has no pulse, and fails to respond to resuscitation, the realization that she is dead triggers the emotion of grief.<br><br>Grief may also begin at the time one learns about a loved one's death, whenever that might be. A young man whose mother was estranged from the family had rare, treasured contacts with her. Because of his mother's life-style of moving frequently, there wasn't an address or telephone where he could reach her, and he had to depend on her contacting him. When she died in an auto accident, it was several weeks before the family was notified of her death. His grief began when he got the belated news.<br><br><b>1.3 How Long Does Grief Last?</b><br><br>Since grief is painful, you undoubtedly want to know how long you will have to endure this powerful emotion. Pain is generally more tolerable if we know it's going to end sometime.<br><br>A shorthand answer concerning the duration of grief is that it will take as long as it needs to take. It will take longer for some people than others, depending on the nature of their relationship to the deceased, the circumstances of the death, their support systems, how they cope with adversity, what else is going on in their lives, and the resources they have available to them.<br><br>A young man called me one day to say that he was worried about his mother. His father had died and he was wondering just how long his mother would be acting so upset. I asked him how long his father had been dead and he replied, "Two weeks." When I responded, "That's not very long," he asked, "Well, will she be better in two months?" Once again I had to say, "That's not a very long time." He seemed disappointed that grief can't be put on a fast track.<br><br>You may encounter loving and well-meaning friends who hate to see you hurt and want to see your mourning end. They may not understand that the worst thing you can do is to try to shut off or deny these powerful feelings. Often these are people who have never experienced the death of a loved one and don't yet comprehend the function and importance of mourning. If you have friends pushing you in this direction, simply tell them that you can recover from your grief but that you need time to work it out; when you have done so, you expect to be back on track again. (See Chapter 10, "A Friend in Need.")<br><br>Although your grief can be expected to last a relatively long time -- from a few months to several years -- it won't always be the all-encompassing feeling of despair that you are feeling now. Commonly grief is sporadic. You will have good days as well as bad days. You may catch yourself laughing, perhaps guiltily, at a friend's joke, and then, moments later, bursting into tears when you hear a nostalgic song that reminds you of your loved one.<br><br>At some point your grief will end, but this doesn't mean that there will ever be an end to your sense of loss. A father whose son had died a quarter century earlier said, "If I were an actor on stage and needed to produce tears, I would only have to think of my son to cry." This father is a happy man leading a full and productive life, but the memory of his son and of the pain of his death will always be with him. You can expect your grief to pass, but this won't mean forgetting your loved one.<br><br>"Time will heal" is a common saying. Part of it is true, and part is myth. Time will aid in recovery from grief, but it is time that needs to be used well. Time spent frantically running from grief -- traveling, perhaps, or visiting relatives, keeping ever busy with never a moment to think about one's loss -- will not help. Eventually, you will run out of places to go or things to do, and at that point you will have to face the void created by the death of your loved one. On the other hand, if you use your time to <i>mourn</i> your loss, to adjust to a different kind of life, and to get acquainted with your now somewhat altered (maybe greatly altered) identity, healing will occur faster.<br><br>You may feel that your grief is unique. You are right, it is unique; the circumstances of your life will make it so. There is no standard recipe for grief that will apply to your situation. However, there are factors that will influence the length of your grief, and you can gain some reassurance from knowing what they are. (See Chapter 6, "Differences That Matter.")<br><br><b><i>Age of the Deceased</i></b><br><br>The younger the person is who died the more difficult it is likely to be to mourn that death. It seems unnatural in the scheme of life for a child to die, just as it seems unfair for a young adult to die just when life's adventure is about to begin. On the other hand, when an elderly person dies, one may feel some comfort in knowing that the person had lived a long and productive life. (See section 6.1 for discussion on old age, 6.7 on grandparents, and 6.14 on children.)<br><br><b><i>Cause of Death</i></b><br><br>When loved ones know in advance that death is approaching, they may experience much of their grief long before the actual death. Thus, they may actually feel a somewhat guilty sense of relief when the death occurs, and what grief remains may be of short duration. Alternatively, the more sudden or violent the death, such as an unexpected fatal heart attack, car accident, or suicide, the longer one may expect grief to last. Not only will the bereaved person have had no time to prepare for the death or to say good-bye, but the suddenness and possible violence of the death will add to the burden of grief. (See sections 6.1 through 6.5 on different kinds of death situations.)<br><br><b><i>Nature of Relationship</i></b><br><br>Was your relationship with the deceased a loving, fulfilling one? Has it left you with a sense of completeness, filled with memories to be treasured? Or was your relationship with the deceased stormy and volatile? The emotions generated by those relationships will play a part in determining the length and intensity of your grief. (See section 7.17 on conflicted relationships.)<br><br><b><i>Other Events in One's Life</i></b><br><br>Life following the death of a loved one doesn't always cooperate to allow one to work through one's grief. A very common story goes like this: "Not only do I have to deal with my dad's death, but now my favorite aunt has died, my car has broken down, work is not going well, and I don't know what will happen next or which to deal with first."<br><br>Other events in one's life sometimes dictate what must be handled first, making it necessary to put grief on hold. When this happens, the need to mourn is still there and will emerge at a later date, perhaps weeks or months later. Such complications will lengthen your grief and mourning period. (See section 7.1 on other changes in one's life.)<br><br><b><i>Support Systems</i></b><br><br>The support and understanding you have around you will make a big difference in how you experience and handle your grief. Do you have a family that has rallied to your needs, or do you feel isolated and abandoned? Do you have care and understanding at your workplace, or are you expected to be 100 percent productive immediately? How about your friends? Are they loving and supportive, or are they making comments such as, "Come on now, put this behind you"? The more support you have, the quicker your recovery from grief will be, but you will still need time to reflect on your loss, to mourn, and to become comfortable with the changes in your life.<br><br><b><i>Resources One Can Command</i></b><br><br>Communities are becoming more aware of the needs of the bereaved and are developing more resources to help people like you recover from their grief. If you feel the need of such help but don't have the energy to do the research, ask a friend to seek out the resources that are available to you. Check your library or local bookstore for appropriate books. Watch for announcements of lectures that may be informative. Search out any support groups that would apply to your needs by checking with your local newspaper, mental health center, library bulletin board, library reference desk, church, temple, or local hospice. Support groups are informal gatherings of people who are dealing with similar situations in their lives. It is often very comforting to be with others who can "really understand" how you feel. (For more help, see the Bibliography and Resources at the back of this book.)<br><br><b><i>One's Coping Skills</i></b><br><br>As you wrestle with your grief, it may be helpful to reflect on how you have coped with other situations in your life. At times of crisis what was your response? Did you seek out information and help, or did you simply try to ignore what was happening and hope that it would pass? Did you get activated in solving the problem, or did you bury yourself in your work? "Know thyself" is a good rule to apply at times like this. Refining your coping skills can help shorten your grief.<br><br><b><i>Sexual Differences</i></b><br><br>"Vive la difference," said the Frenchman about the sexes. But the differences are not as great as some would have us believe. Popular culture allows women to show their emotions and seek support but requires men to be "strong," which is defined as not showing any emotion. Men are expected to make the tough decisions, take on the unpleasant jobs, and never cry. This need not be so. In fact, it is unhealthy for anyone to lock up his emotions; they need to be expressed.<br><br>Of course, crying is not the only outlet for one's feelings. Chopping wood, physical exercise, or building a guest room on the house are outlets that may be more comfortable to a man. Years ago the father of two dead sons poured his sorrow into creating a beautiful azalea garden in Washington, D.C., which is visited every year by thousands of admirers.<br><br>Also, it is now quite common for men to attend support groups to help them deal with their grief. There they find other men to talk to who share their feelings of anger and remorse. If you are a man struggling with grief, don't let imagined taboos prevent you from mourning your loss; you have just as much right to express your feelings as any woman suffering a similar loss.<br><br><b>1.4 Does Grief End?</b><br><br>Keeping in mind the definition of grief as "intense emotional suffering," you can look forward, at some point, to an end to these overwhelming emotions. This does not mean that you will cease feeling sad or wistful, nor does it mean that you will forget your loved one. However, it does mean that the intense emotional conflicts which you may be experiencing today can be brought to an end as you integrate this loss into your changed life. (See the introduction to Chapter 9 and sections 9.1 and 9.2 on helping yourself and on getting better.)<br><br><b>1.5 Why Must You Express Your Grief?</b><br><br>"Why must I express my grief? Why can't I just ignore it and get on with my life?" are questions you may be asking yourself as you suffer the pain of grief. The answers lie, not in theory, but in observed human experience. People who try to ignore the powerful, deep-seated emotions of grief usually see them reappear later in disturbing forms: physical responses such as rheumatoid arthritis, stomach ulcers, colitis, hiatal hernias, nervous tics, weight loss (or gain), chills, insomnia, back pains, or incessant headaches; or psychological responses such as depression, fits of unexplained anger, interpersonal problems, preoccupation with one's own death, anxiety, or new, unpleasant personality traits. There are no more powerful feelings than those arising from grief--ignore them at your peril. However, by learning to identify these feelings you can learn how to express them and thus avoid all those unpleasant alternatives.<br><br><b><i>Understanding the Grief Process</i></b><br><br>There is more to grief than what you may be feeling right now. While writers have approached the subject in different ways, there is general agreement that grieving is a <i>process</i> and that grieving people can help themselves by better understanding what is happening to them.<br><br>Writers on the subject of grief have attempted to identify different aspects of the process. In 1969 Elisabeth K�bler-Ross wrote about the five stages of dying. Her book <i>On Death and Dying,</i> although written for the dying person, is really a book on grieving, helpful not only to the dying but to the bereaved as well. Her five stages consisted of the following:<br><br>(1) denial and isolation<br><br>(2) anger<br><br>(3) bargaining<br><br>(4) depression<br><br>(5) acceptance<br><br>In the denial and isolation stage, the grieving person refuses to accept the harsh reality confronting him or her. In the anger phase the person is continuing to resist reality and to ask, "Why me? Why not that old woman down the street?" In the bargaining phase the person tries to reverse that reality in various irrational ways, as in "bargaining with God," promising to do certain good works, perhaps, if God will spare your loved one. For example, I promised God I would say a rosary a day if He allowed my husband to live. The depression stage reflects the person's recogniti...</p><h2>Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor: Being the First Jane Austen Mystery (Being A Jane Austen Mystery)</h2><p><b>For everyone who loves Jane Austen . . . a marvelously entertaining new series that turns the incomparable author into an extraordinary sleuth!<br></b> <br> On a visit to the estate of her friend, the young and beautiful Isobel Payne, Countess of Scargrave, Jane bears witness to a tragedy. Isobel's husband&#x2014;a gentleman of mature years&#x2014;is felled by a mysterious and agonizing ailment. The Earl's death seems a cruel blow of fate for the newly married Isobel. Yet the bereaved widow soon finds that it's only the beginning of her misfortune . . . as she receives a sinister missive accusing her and the Earl's nephew of adultery&#x2014;and murder. Desperately afraid that the letter will expose her to the worst sort of scandal, Isobel begs Jane for help.

And yet never before have these abilities been more valuable or sought after. What's needed is a new type of leader -- one who can inspire and motivate others while adhering to timeless leadership principles such as flexibility, adaptability, trustworthiness, and distribution of power. With <i>Leadership Mastery</i>, you will identify your strengths and adopt effective strategies to: <br> � Gain the respect and admiration of others using little-known secrets of America's most successful leaders<br> � Get family, friends, and coworkers to do what you ask because they want to, not because they have to<br> � Respond effectively in a crisis<br> � Make powerful decisions and follow through on them using Carnegie's action formula <br> Incorporating interviews with top leaders in business, entertainment, sports, and academia, <i>Leadership Mastery</i> stands next to the classic <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>.</p><p><b>Dale Carnegie</b> was born in 1888 in Missouri. He wrote his now-renowned book <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> in 1936. This milestone cemented the rapid spread of his core values across the United States. During the 1950s, the foundations of Dale Carnegie Training� as it exists today began to take form. Dale Carnegie himself passed away soon after in 1955, leaving his legacy and set of core principles to be disseminated for decades to come. Today, the Dale Carnegie Training programs are available in more than&nbsp;30 languages throughout the entire United States and in more than 85 countries. &nbsp;Dale Carnegie includes as its clients 400 of the Fortune 500 companies. &nbsp;Approximately 7 million people have experienced Dale Carnegie Training.ϻ�<b></b><p><b> Preface </b> </p><p> Where have all the leaders gone? There is a vacuum of leadership in the world, in all of our major institutions: government, education, business, religion, and the arts. The crisis has arisen in part because many of those institutions have been reinvented. Life is therefore much more uncertain and leadership is hence much more risky. However, most of the leadership crisis has crept up on us because of the incredible technological revolution we're now experiencing. We are told that the scientific method can solve all our problems and that technology can distribute the answers to those problems far more quickly and efficiently than before. A global society connected by the Internet is emerging, yet never have so many people felt so isolated from one another. Individuals the world over find themselves disconnected from their roots and unsure of their future. This is because in a world quickly becoming more virtual, the skill of human relations is quickly being lost. Thus, never before has the skill of human relations been more valuable and sought after. </p><p> Just about everyone who is anyone has a Web site and an e�&#x20ac;&#x2018;mail address. The only way to differentiate yourself and your business is to become exceptionally skilled at leading and persuading others. Think of it: In the previous era of hierarchical organizations, big government, and traditional families, the need for leadership was evident. We knew what the rules were. We needed the leaders to hold us to those rules. However, in an era of flattened organizations, the increasing irrelevance of government, and two-career families, we no longer have a clear set of rules to follow. </p><p> What's more, the command-and-control leaders who try to hold us to seemingly irrelevant and arbitrary rules are no longer successful. What's needed is a new type of leader, one who can inspire and motivate others within this virtual world while never losing sight of the leadership principles that never change. Therefore in this cutting-edge book, we'll introduce you to a new type of leader: a leader who is flexible and adaptable. We'll introduce you to an individual who is a servant, not a slave, to his or her partners; a distributor of power, trustworthy, tough, and decisive. </p><p> The core philosophy of this book will be taken from the man whose name has become synonymous with influence and human relations, Dale Carnegie. </p><p> In the words of Dale Carnegie himself: </p><blockquote> <i>And now I've just got time to tell you about a couple of simple tests that you can make to prove to yourself how easy it is to make people like you instantly; here they are. Test one, starting tomorrow morning, you smile at the first five people you see at work every day for a week. I mean a good, broad, genuine smile and a hearty good morning. Test two, pick out just one person every day for a week, one person who has never meant very much to you, and become genuinely interested in him and show that you're interested in him with a smile and some friendly comment. Now two words of warning; be sincere, utterly and eternally sincere. You will just be wasting your time if you pretend to be interested in other people in order to get something out of them. That's foolish as well as wrong, because you'll be found out sooner or later. Why not make those two simple tests yourself and keep a record of the results. Remember if you want to be liked instantly, do as the puppy does: Become genuinely interested in other people and show it.</i> </blockquote> <p> These human relations principles have made Dale Carnegie a household name for more than fifty years. Throughout this book, you'll read Dale Carnegie's famous leadership principles exactly as he wrote about them in some of his classic works. Principles like these will never change. It is how they are applied that will change. In the past, an order from the boss may have given the employee enough want. Today leaders must create that want by engaging others in the mission with same the goals but by different processes. </p><p> What's more, you'll learn how the virtual world does not have to become more impersonal. You can use high-tech tools to stay in touch as a leader. Yes, leadership, like any other skill, is not something you are born with. It must be learned. When you have read this book and completed all of the action steps at the end of each chapter, you will possess the most vital skill for succeeding in the new economy: the skill of leadership. The need for this skill will only grow in value as our virtual world expands. </p><p> Finally, once you have completed this book you'll no longer ask, "Where have all the leaders gone?" You'll realize that leadership is no longer for the chief executive officer, the president, the general, the boss, or the mom and dad. Leadership is available to each and every one of us at every level of organization, be that society, business, government, or family. Complete this book and discover your full potential. Become a leadership master. Copyright � 2000, 2009 by Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc.</p><p>ϻ�</p><blockquote> <i>Keep your mind open to change all the time. Welcome it. Court it.</i><br> -- Dale Carnegie </blockquote> <p> <b>Chapter 1 </b></p><p><b> What Leaders Do </b> </p><p> In the chapters that follow we'll be engaged in a very ambitious and extremely important undertaking. It will be of great benefit to you, and also to everyone who comes into your life both personally and professionally. </p><p> We'll be exploring a fundamental principle of human behavior. It's the basis of successful companies and even of whole nations and cultures. This is the concept of <i>leadership</i>. More specifically, we'll focus on the meaning of leadership in the context of business and entrepreneurial success. We'll see how leaders made the most of prosperous times, and how they survived even severe downturns in the business cycle. </p><p> Who are the leaders? What are the leaders made of? Who are the men and women who "made it happen" for themselves and the people around them? How did they overcome obstacles? Where did they discover opportunities? This is critically important information for anyone who aspires to financial success, personal satisfaction, and the sense of accomplishment that comes when potential turns into actuality. </p><p> In today's world, the quality of leadership is both respected and revered, but it's also subtly devalued. We celebrate the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln, great leaders of the past, yet we are deeply suspicious of those who occupy leadership positions in the present day. Perhaps it's because we know too much about them in our present media-dominated environment. No one knew what Washington and Lincoln did every day, much less every minute of the day. Incredible as it now seems, Franklin Roosevelt served more than three terms as president without the majority of people even aware that he could not walk. </p><p> As a first step toward grasping the real meaning of leadership -- and more important, as a step toward becoming an effective leader yourself -- your present view of leadership may need to be reconsidered, reinvented, and even reborn. This book will give you the tools for doing that. By making full use of those tools, you can take a big step toward achieving all your personal and professional goals. </p><p> This raises a very important point that should be emphasized here at the outset. Our purpose here is something much more than theoretical or intellectual understanding of leadership. You're going to learn what leaders have done so that you can start doing it yourself, right away, in your own life and career. That's <i>leadership mastery</i>. It's putting what you learn into action. </p><p> This is an extremely ambitious undertaking, and we have some powerful tools to bring it to a successful conclusion. Very simply put, the foundations of our work toward leadership mastery are the insights, writings, and life example of Dale Carnegie. Known the world over as one of the most influential voices in the history of personal development, his lessons are more relevant today than ever before. </p><p> We'll be looking at up�&#x20ac;&#x2018;to-the-minute issues in today's fast-changing workplace. We'll meet the people, study the organizations, and identify the challenges they face, and that you're facing, on the road to professional success and personal fulfillment. </p><p> THE LONGEVITY OF LEVI STRAUSS </p><p> Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has been in business for more than 150 years. Over those many decades there have been plenty of peaks and valleys such as the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which destroyed the company showroom and many local businesses. </p><p> Despite the obvious hardships, the company continued to pay its employees while new buildings were built, and extended credit to its wholesale suppliers whose facilities had also been destroyed. Ethical leadership has always been a core value at Levi Strauss, whether the challenge was a major earthquake or competition from Calvin Klein. In keeping with an "aspiration statement" that the company issued in 1987, managers at Levi Strauss know that they're evaluated in many other areas besides financial performance. </p><p> As much as 40 percent of Levi Strauss's management bonuses are based on measures of leadership in ethics, human relations, and effective communication. </p><p> IBM: BUSINESS AND BELIEFS </p><p> More than twenty years before Levi Strauss created its aspiration statement, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., then the head of IBM, wrote a book called <i>A Business and Its Beliefs</i>. Watson knew that one of his most vital responsibilities as a leader was to clarify the core values of IBM. The values he led by made IBM one of America's truly dominant companies throughout the '50s, '60s, and '70s. </p><p> Interestingly enough, years before he wrote the book, Watson foresaw the problems that would almost cause IBM's downfall when the technological revolution dawned. Thirty years before anyone had ever heard of a blog or a Web site or an e�&#x20ac;&#x2018;mail, Watson told an...</p></p><h2>The Chesapeake House: Architectural Investigation by Colonial Williamsburg</h2><p>For more than thirty years, the architectural research department at Colonial Williamsburg has engaged in comprehensive study of early buildings, landscapes, and social history in the Chesapeake region. Its painstaking work has transformed our understanding of building practices in the colonial and early national periods and thereby greatly enriched the experience of visiting historic sites. In this beautifully illustrated volume, a team of historians, curators, and conservators draw on their far-reaching knowledge of historic structures in Virginia and Maryland to illuminate the formation, development, and spread of one of the hallmark building traditions in American architecture. <br> The essays describe how building design, hardware, wall coverings, furniture, and even paint colors telegraphed social signals about the status of builders and owners and choreographed social interactions among everyone who lived or worked in gentry houses, modest farmsteads, and slave quarters. The analyses of materials, finishes, and carpentry work will fascinate old-house buffs, preservationists, and historians alike. The lavish color photography is a delight to behold, and the detailed catalogues of architectural elements provide a reliable guide to the form, style, and chronology of the region's distinctive historic architecture.<br><br></p><p>"A remarkable book. Cary Carson and his colleagues have transformed the way architectural history fieldwork is performed and in the process have also changed our understanding of the early architecture of the Chesapeake."--Carter L.

These powerful themes ricochet through Lorenzo Carcaterra&#x2019;s new novel like bullets from a machine gun. In <i>Gangster</i>, he surpasses even his bestselling <i>Sleepers</i> to create a brutal and brilliant American saga of murder, forgiveness, and redemption.</b><br><br>Born in the midst of tragedy and violence and raised in the shadow of a shocking secret, young Angelo Vestieri chooses to flee both his past and his father to seek a second family&#x2014;the criminals who preside over early 20th century New York. In his bloody rise from soldier to mob boss, he encounters ever more barbaric betrayals&#x2014;in friendship, in his brutal business, in love&#x2014;yet simultaneously comes to understand the meaning of loyalty, the virtue of relationships, and gains a perspective on the lonely, if powerful, life he has chosen.<br><br>As the years pass, as enemies are made and defeated, as wars are fought and won, the old don meets an abandoned boy who needs a parent as much as protection. By taking Gabe under his wing and teaching him everything he knows, Angelo Vestieri will learn, in the winter of his life, which is greater: his love for the boy he cherishes, or his need to be a gangster and to live by the savage rules he helped create.<br><br>A sweeping panoramic with riveting characters, a unique understanding of the underworld philosophy, and a relentless pace, Gangster travels through the time of godfathers and goodfellas to our own world of suburban Sopranos. But this is more than just an authentic chronicle of crime. Setting a new standard for this acclaimed author, Gangster is a compassionate portrait of one man's fight against his fate&#x2014;and an unforgettable epic of a family, a city, a century.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to anyone who understands the derivative nature of filmmaking that Lorenzo Carcaterra's newest has already been bought for a TV miniseries. After all, how many times can you rerun all three parts of <i>The Godfather</i>? Here the author of <i>Sleepers</i> and <i>Apaches</i> provides a full accounting of the life of one Angelo Vestiere, told from the perspective of two people who witnessed it firsthand: Gabe, the street kid who ultimately betrayed Angelo's hope that he would succeed him; and Mary, the woman who loved him. One knows a secret about the other, which isn't revealed until the book's final pages. But by that time the secret doesn't matter and sheds no more light on Angelo than the reader has gleaned in the previous chapters.<p> Angelo has few redeeming characteristics. As the protagonist of this sprawling novel of the rise of organized crime in America, he never earns the reader's empathy, despite Carcaterra's attempts to humanize his central character by presenting the "code of the gangster" as a believable rationale for Angelo's existence and his success in his chosen career. By far the more interesting thugs who people this book are Pudge, Angus McQueen, and Ida the Goose, a trio of fellow gangsters the author pulls into Angelo's orbit. Despite their moral and ethical shortcomings, they are picaresque enough to have a certain raffish charm. But Angelo is no Don Corleone or even Tony Soprano. And while Carcaterra's a journeyman writer, he's not ready to inherit the mantle of the late (and in this case sadly lamented) Mario Puzo. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Lorenzo Carcaterra is the author of the memoir A Safe Place, Apaches, and the New York Times bestseller Sleepers.

In 1995, Dr. Agatston developed the South Beach Diet to help his cardiac and diabetes patients improve their blood chemistries and lose weight.

He lives in Miami Beach with his wife, Sari.COOK QUICKLY, EAT SLOWLY<br><br>For many busy people, "home cooking" has come to mean a take-out meal from the closest fast-food franchise. In fact, recent statistics show that the average American household spends about $2,500 annually at take-out establishments and restaurants, or about 71 percent of what it spends on groceries ($3,500). This percentage is even higher for householders aged 25 to 34 (81 percent) and for people who live alone (79 percent). And these numbers appear to be growing--along with our waistlines.<br><br>The sad reality is that two-thirds of the adults and one-third of the children in this country are either overweight or obese. Today, the typical baby boomer male weighs just shy of 200 �ds and the average female weighs more than 170. That's in part because a typical fast-food quarter- �d cheeseburger packs a hefty 500 calories, the large fries another 500, the supersized soda 300 more, and an ice cream dessert an additional 500. That's 1,800 calories from a single meal! Couple that with the fact that most people don't exercise enough and it's small wonder that conditions like diabetes and heart disease are on the rise, and few of us feel very good about what we see in the mirror.<br><br>Not a very appetizing way to start off a cookbook, is it? But I bring up these statistics for a good reason. If we continue at this sad pace, dining out more than we're eating in and skipping the supermarket for the drive- thru, this country's burgeoning obesity epidemic will have dire consequences, not just for our present and future health but for our health- care system as well. Doctors and hospitals simply won't be able to handle all the new cases of prediabetes, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and other obesityrelated conditions. The good news? One of our most effective remedies for all of these ailments can be found in our own refrigerators, pantries, and cupboards.<br><br>That said, I know few of us have time to linger in the kitchen, stirring up elaborate meals from scratch. As a practicing cardiologist who often gets home from the office late and who doesn't cook all that well himself, I rely on my very busy wife to make sure I eat nutritious meals. Fortunately, she also stocks the kitchen with the kind of healthy ingredients needed to put good meals together quickly. So when she isn't home to cook due to her own busy schedule, I can put together an easy, speedy meal.<br><br>As this book will show you, if you plan your meals ahead, shop thoughtfully, and organize your pantry and kitchen for quick cooking, you'll easily be able to turn out healthy, delicious food for the whole family with very little stress. And I guarantee you'll look and feel better for it, too.<br><br>I often like to remind my patients who enjoy cooking that preparing a meal quickly should not translate to rushing at the table. Eating thoughtfully and slowly, really tasting what we eat, allows us to experience a sense of fullness naturally without overeating. I remember as a child always being told to clean my plate. For me, that was an invitation to wolf down dinner and get on to other things. Today, I'm sorry to say that I still tend to eat a bit too quickly; I often have to remind myself not to take second helpings before my brain gets the signal that I'm full.<br><br>On the South Beach Diet, you won't leave the table hungry, but you shouldn't feel stuffed, either. I like to say that you should eat until you are satisfied, not until you are full. Research now shows that routinely galloping through meals often leads to chronic overeating and obesity. This is because putting too much food in your stomach too quickly can interfere with the body's feedback mechanisms, allowing you to continue to take in more calories because you don't yet feel full. I recommend starting lunch or dinner with a filling cup of soup, like the White Bean and Escarole Soup with Shaved Parmesan on page 62, or with a fiber-rich salad like the Fennel, Cucumber, and Watercress Salad on page 219. I also suggest putting down your fork between bites. Don't worry if you leave some food on your plate; if you are satisfied, you've had enough. And please, enjoy a few bites of a decadent dessert from time to time. (My favorite, Chocolate Truffle Tartlets, is on page 232.)<br><br>Preparing the healthy, superquick recipes in this book represents the ultimate win-win scenario: Not only will you be eating far better than you would were you spending your food dollars in restaurants or on processed foods, but the time you save in the kitchen means that you will have more time to relax, savor your food, and enjoy some good conversation with family and friends. And as far as I'm concerned, that's what home cooking should be about.<br><br>--Arthur Agatston, MD</p><h2>High and Dry: Gardening with Cold-Hardy Dryland Plants</h2><p><p>Gardeners in the Interior West and Great Plains face a daunting challenge: a harsh, semi-arid climate of scorching summers and brutally cold winters.

While hitting #1 on the <em>Billboard</em> charts was exhilarating, the group&#x2019;s success soon became overwhelming.

Visit randalldeseve.com.PreS-Gr 2-A young girl has a new neighbor named Zola. Both girls' mothers think that they will be fast friends. But our narrator worries, what if Zola already has a best friend? Her imagination takes over when she sees a big box being moved into Zola's house. She's convinced it must contain an elephant, and why would Zola need her, if she already has an elephant with whom to play hide-and-seek, build a clubhouse, and to take bubble baths? The author and illustrator tap into the feelings of insecurities that young children face with the uncertainty of new beginnings. As the young girl frets over all of the reasons that Zola will not need her, Zagarenski captures these imaginings with her trademark illustrations full of crowns, stars, and swirls that sprinkle the page. The colorful, digital and mixed-media illustrations are offset when viewers see Zola's reality full of hard lines, gray palette, and empty space to show the loneliness and sadness that she is actually feeling moving into a new place. Finally, the narrator decides that all the things she imagines Zola having and experiencing are things that she also loves; she braves her feelings and goes to meet Zola. Zagarenski's textured and detailed illustrations will capture children's imaginations, and will have them enthralled as they follow the many smaller animal familiars through the pages.

Whether for daily devotions or for sound insight into a particular issue, Watkins paraphrase blends the ancient with the modern to introduce this classic to a new audience, speaking to all Christians with credibility and authority and using inclusive language not found in the original.</p><h2>Making Prayer Real: Leading Jewish Spiritual Voices on Why Prayer Is Difficult and What to Do about It</h2><p><p><b>Fresh, Useful Perspectives on the Spiritual Dynamics of Prayer</b></p><blockquote><p>"Better music, better sermons and better prayer books can only go so far.

Do you wonder just who you are praying to and if it is worth the effort? Does your search for religious meaning take you anywhere but to synagogue and the traditional Jewish prayer book? If so, you're not alone. <br>This is a no-holds-barred look at why so many of us find synagogue services and prayer at best difficult, and at worst, meaningless and boring--and how to make it more satisfying. Rabbi Mike Comins draws from over fifty interviews with Jewish spiritual leaders from all denominations, as well as from their "best prayer practices." He offers a new and different response to the challenges of prayer to entice and inspire you to become a "prayer person," a person who engages in prayer to play the heart strings of the soul. <br>He then guides you in overcoming the obstacles to achieving a satisfying prayer life through twenty-four innovative and traditional practices, relating prayer to the needs of conscious living: <br>* Nurturing joy <br>* Increasing mindfulness <br>* Facilitating self-change <br>* Dealing with tragedy <br>* Responding to loss<p><strong>Rabbi Mike Comins</strong>, the founder of TorahTrek Spiritual Wilderness Adventures (www.TorahTrek.com) and the Institute for Jewish Wilderness Spirituality (www.ijws-online.org), is the author of <em>A Wild Faith: Jewish Ways into Wilderness, Wilderness Ways into Judaism</em> and <em>Making Prayer Real: Leading Jewish Spiritual Voices on Why Prayer Is Difficult and What to Do about It</em> (both Jewish Lights).

It was no ordinary murder. Though the torture and abuse that killed him were real, Andy Gage's death wasn't. Only his soul actually died, and when it died, it broke in pieces. Then the pieces became souls in their own right, coinheritors of Andy Gage's life. . . . </p> <p> While Andy deals with the outside world, more than a hundred other souls share an imaginary house inside Andy's head, struggling to maintain an orderly coexistence: Aaron, the father figure; Adam, the mischievous teenager; Jake, the frightened little boy; Aunt Sam, the artist; Seferis, the defender; and Gideon, who wants to get rid of Andy and the others and run things on his own. </p> <p> Andy's new coworker, Penny Driver, is also a multiple personality, a fact that Penny is only partially aware of. When several of Penny's other souls ask Andy for help, Andy reluctantly agrees, setting in motion a chain of events that threatens to destroy the stability of the house. Now Andy and Penny must work together to uncover a terrible secret that Andy has been keeping . . . from himself. </p></p><p><p>Matt Ruff is the author of <em>The Mirage, Bad Monkeys, Set This House in Order, Fool on the Hill,</em> and <em>Sewer, Gas &amp; Electric</em>. He lives in Seattle.</p>Ruff tells a surprisingly dense story that boils down to a journey of self-discovery. Andy Gage, created two years ago, is the public face of a multiple personality. There are hundreds of souls in his head, governed by his father as Andy lives in a house on a lakeshore. In the world outside, Andy works on ambitious, but unlikely, virtual reality projects. There, new programmer Penny Driver turns out to be a multiple personality, too, and the boss wants Andy to help her. Several of Penny's other souls ask for help, which Andy finally, reluctantly, agrees to give, thereby setting himself on a path that threatens the stability of his house. It seems Andy isn't as cured as he thought he was. There are still secrets in his hometown and in his mind, secrets that could destroy him. Because of the high quality of characterization in it and the unusual route the many souls of Andy Gage must take on his journey of self-discovery, this is an engaging piece of work. <i>Regina Schroeder</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From the savory stews of the western savannah to the curries and chutneys of the Swahili coasts, prominent scholar Jessica Harris has assembled a collection of recipes that reflects the modern innovations and rich heritage of kitchens across Africa. Potatoes with Mint Leaves and Garlic from Algeria and Senegal&#x2019;s classic Theibou Dienn are among the many flavorful dishes that offer a change of pace for contemporary North Americans. Illustrated with archival photographs and peppered with history and anecdote, <i>The Africa Cookbook </i>is a celebration of cultures and individuals whose contributions to the way we eat have long been ignored.</p><p>Mr. Mercator, maker of wall maps, would have us believe that the continent of Africa is this piddly little thing, mostly below the equator, weighed down by the size and majesty of Europe. Jessica B. Harris, author of <i>The Africa Cookbook</i>, shows us how big this continent truly is (three times the landmass of Europe; 1,000 different languages); how incredibly ancient its history is; how grand and majestic is the sweep of cooking styles and food flavors that shift from north to south, east to west; and how up-to-the-minute and relevant those food and flavor experiences can be. As with any of Harris's previous books, the reader can savor equal portions of eye-opening scholarship, delectable storytelling, and delicious recipes. <p> The book is divided into chapters that discuss the edible history of Africa, the range of food regions in Africa, a glossary of African ingredients and utensils, and an argument that the much vaunted Mediterranean diet needs to look south for its origins. Recipe chapters fall along traditional lines: appetizers, salads and soups, condiments, vegetables, main dishes, breads and starches, desserts, and beverages--and include dishes from all over the continent.

He'd identified the voice now, knew which one of his granddaughters was burrowed in bed at what Daniel MacGregor considered the middle of the day. "A fine, bright September morning. You should be up enjoying it, little girl, instead of sleeping it away."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>He huffed. "Life's passing you by, Laura. Your grandmother's worried about you. Why, she was just saying last night how she could barely get a moment's peace of mind, worrying about her oldest granddaughter."<br><br>Anna had said nothing of the kind, but the ploy of using his wife to finagle his family into doing what he wanted them to do was an old habit.

Julia MacGregor fisted her hands on her hips and smoldered. "I was expecting a call."<br><br>"I, ah..." Her mind was an unfocused blur.

Julia shrugged. "I guess I was in the shower. Gwen's already left for the hospital. What did Grandpa want?" When Laura continued to look blank, Julia laughed and sat on the edge of the bed. "Probably just the usual. 'Your grandmother's worried about you.'"<br><br>"I seem to remember something about that." Smiling a little, Laura plopped back onto the pillows.

This book presents with nine of his speeches that reflect the development, variety, and drama of his political career. Among them are two speeches from his prosecution of Verres, a corrupt and cruel governor of Sicily; four speeches against the conspirator Catiline; and the <em>Second Philippic</em>, the famous denunciation of Mark Antony, which cost Cicero his life. Also included are <em>On the Command of Gnaeus Pompeius</em>, in which he praises the military successes of Pompey, and <em>For Marcellus</em>, a panegyric in praise of the dictator Julius Caesar. <br> These new translations preserve Cicero's oratorical brilliance and achieve new standards of accuracy. A general introduction outlines Cicero's public career, and separate introductions explain the political significance of each of the speeches. This edition also provides an up-to-date scholarly bibliography, glossary and two maps. Together with the companion volume of <em>Defense Speeches</em>, this edition provides an unparalleled sampling of Cicero's achievements. <br><br></p><p>D.H.

There is now overwhelming evidence that regular exercise can help relieve low mood-from feelings of stress and anxiety to full depressive episodes. <br><br>With <em>Exercise for Mood and Anxiety</em>, Michael Otto and Jasper Smits, well-known authorities on cognitive behavioral therapy, take their empirically-based mood regulation strategy from the clinic to the general public. Written for those with diagnosed mood disorders as well as those who simply need a new strategy for managing the low mood and stress that is an everyday part of life, this book provides readers with step-by-step guidance on how to start and maintain an exercise program geared towards improving mood, with a particular emphasis on understanding the relationship between mood and motivation. Readers learn to attend carefully to mood states prior to and following physical activity in order to leverage the full benefits of exercise, and that the trick to maintaining an exercise program is not in applying more effort, but in arranging one's environment so that less effort is needed. As a result readers not only acquire effective strategies for adopting a successful program, but are introduced to a broader philosophy for enhancing overall well-being. Providing patient vignettes, rich examples, and extensive step-by-step guidance on overcoming the obstacles that prevent adoption of regular exercise for mood, <em>Exercise for Mood and Anxiety</em> is a unique translation of scientific principles of clinical and social psychology into an action-based strategy for mood change.<br></p><p>Michael W.

Conventional wisdom dictates that Ukraine's current crisis can be traced to the linguistic differences and divided political loyalties that have long fractured the country. However this theory only obscures the true significance of Ukraine's recent civic revolution and the conflict's crucial international dimension. The 2013-14 Ukrainian revolution presented authoritarian powers in Russia with both a democratic and a geopolitical challenge. President Vladimir Putin reacted aggressively by annexing the Crimea and sponsoring the war in eastern Ukraine; and Russia's actions subsequently prompted Western sanctions and growing international tensions reminiscent of the Cold War. Though the media portrays the situation as an ethnic conflict, an internal Ukrainian affair, it is in reality reflective of a global discord, stemming from differing views on state power, civil society, and democracy.<br><br><em>The Conflict in Ukraine: What Everyone Needs to Know</em> explores Ukraine's contemporary conflict and complicated history of ethnic identity, and it does do so by weaving questions of the country's fraught relations with its former imperial master, Russia, throughout the narrative. In denying Ukraine's existence as a separate nation, Putin has adopted a stance similar to that of the last Russian tsars, who banned the Ukrainian language in print and on stage. Ukraine emerged as a nation-state as a result of the imperial collapse in 1917, but it was subsequently absorbed into the USSR. When the former Soviet republics became independent states in 1991, the Ukrainian authorities sought to assert their country's national distinctiveness, but they failed to reform the economy or eradicate corruption. As Serhy Yekelchyk explains, for the last 150 years recognition of Ukraine as a separate nation has been a litmus test of Russian democracy, and the Russian threat to Ukraine will remain in place for as long as the Putinist regime is in power. In this concise and penetrating book, Yekelchyk describes the current crisis in Ukraine, the country's ethnic composition, and the Ukrainian national identity. He takes readers through the history of Ukraine's emergence as a sovereign nation, the after-effects of communism, the Orange Revolution, the EuroMaidan, the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, the war in the Donbas, and the West's attempts at peace making. <em>The Conflict in</em> <em>Ukraine</em> is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the forces that have shaped contemporary politics in this increasingly important part of Europe.<br><br><em>What Everyone Needs to Know�</em> is a registered trademark of Oxford University Press.<br></p><p><br>Born and educated in Ukraine, <strong>Serhy Yekelchyk</strong> has published widely on modern Ukrainian history and Russian-Ukrainian relations. His <em>Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation</em> was the first historical survey to include the 2004 Orange Revolution and has since been translated into five languages. A professor at the University of Victoria, Dr. Yekelchyk currently serves as president of the Canadian Association of Ukrainian Studies.<br><br>"Excellent... a succinct, lucid text that is ideal for newcomers to recent Ukrainian events." --<em>The Financial Times</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Power of Gentleness: Meditations on the Risk of Living</h2><p><p>Key moments of our lives, especially at the beginning and end, are marked by gentleness&#x2015;but the simplicity of that concept is misleading. Gentleness is an active passivity that may become an extraordinary force of resistance within ethics and politics. In this powerful rethinking by a renowned philosopher and psychoanalyst, whose untimely death captured worldwide attention, gentleness becomes a series of embodied paradoxes: power that is also soft, nobility that is also humble, sweetness that is also intelligent, subtlety that is nevertheless striking, fragility that has the potential to subvert the status quo.</p><p>In Greek and Christian myth, in the philosophical and religious traditions of China and India, and across Western literature and art, gentleness occurs in moments of tenderness such as birth, care, and mutual love, but also where least expected, amid danger, humiliation, and cruelty. Gentleness, Dufourmantelle shows, is marked above all by our early human connections to the physical world, uncovered and rediscovered primarily through the senses, with all the ambivalences that entails.</p><p>Today, we are most familiar with a gentleness sold to us in the diluted form of mawkishness. This is how we try to evade its subtlety&#x2015;no longer by fighting it, but by enfeebling it. In the name of our highest values&#x2015;happiness, truth, security&#x2015;we enforce &#x201c;gentle&#x201d; safeguards against hurt and are persuaded to participate in our era&#x2019;s three divinities: efficiency, speed, and profitability. But in doing so we seal ourselves off from the life-affirming gamble that a true gentleness affords.</p><p>True gentleness entails an ethic of desire. Against a society that crushes human beings &#x201c;gently&#x201d; through consumerist logic and the illusion of total transparency, Dufourmantelle celebrates the uncompromising gentleness discovered by Gandhi and other revolutionaries. At the same time, within the despair confided by her patients, she traces the force of resistance and intangible magic that gentleness offers in the lived experience of ordinary women and men who fully embrace the risk of living.<br><i></i><br><i>This work received the French Voices Award for excellence in publication and translation.

In this important and pioneering work, that same structural vision is applied to the visceral system. The central premise of <i>Visceral Manipulation</i> is that the interrelationship of structure and function among the internal organs is at least as strong as that among the constituents of the musculoskeletal system; and that, like the musculoskeletal system, manipulation of the viscera can be beneficially used in the treatment of a wide variety of problems affecting any of the body&#x2019;s systems. In this revised edition, over a hundred-and-thirty new illustrations and photographs, many of them in two colors, graphically depict the ideas in the text.

The trouble began with a bang, literally, on Sunday when the cops shot down John Dillinger outside the Biograph. Gangster was seeing a movie. If you didn't know better, you might have believed the deceased was seeking revenge: As the final larcenous breath rattled out of his lungs, the city was being strangled.<br><br>By Tuesday, the mercury in the snazzy Havoline Thermometer Tower, soaring over the Century of Progress fairgrounds on the lakefront, had shot up to 105-with 109 degrees reported inland at the airport. Either way, it was the hottest day ever on record for Chicago.<br><br>Heat deformed the air, which seemed to wobble. Clothes stuck to flesh. Flesh stank. With ice in short supply and the stench of the slaughterhouses ripening-where pigs strode doomed over the bridge of sighs and cattle hung bloody from hooks-people fled to the beaches of Lake Michigan to sleep.<br><br>During the day, perspiring throngs pressed their way into the Great Halls and pavilions at the world's fair, less interested in the scientific and cultural marvels on display than in inhaling refrigerated air. They poured out onto the midway, dripping into their summer cottons and brimmed hats, fanning their faces with folded maps, mopping up ice cream that melted faster than they could eat. Freaks, savages, steamy strippers, and miniature humans were there for their viewing pleasure. If people couldn't stanch the sweat, they could at least secure a couple of hours' respite from the cruel Depression and the news coming out of Germany.<br><br>Today, the high-finally!-was supposed to be south of 100. That in itself was cause for celebration. As for the news, for the fifteen minutes between 12:45 and 1:00 p.m., the airwaves would belong to Dr. Martin Arthur Couney and the adorable babies whose lives he had saved in his incubator sideshow.<br><br>The radio script had a written instruction not to conduct today�s program as a farce. Yes, the announcer could make a few cracks about all the crying and yelping, but he needed to mind himself, on account of the �ethical standing� of the city�s physicians who had a manicured hand in this thing. This baby �homecoming� would not be half as fun as the midget wedding two weeks earlier. Why, even a former vice president of the United States had been out in the Lilliputian Village when that tiny torch singer married her groom, and the cops had to stop the mob from going nuts.<br><br>Every day, you had a new extravaganza at the Century of Progress. It wasn't just the grand Hall of Science, the Halls of Religion, and Travel and Transport, the Homes of Tomorrow, with everything prefabricated, some kind of dream. It was Ripley's and strippers and marching bands and neon Deco blazing through the sweltering night. So what if it wasn't as grand as the famous White City back in 1893? Who cared if the old folks didn't find the sky ride quite as stirring as the Ferris wheel they liked to carry on about? You really had to hand it to the planners and the backers-they'd managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat of the Depression.<br><br>Given a choice, you might rather escape than eat. People jam-packed the midway, reeking of Tabu perfume, of Burma-Shave, and summer BO, ready to part with whatever they had, dollars thick in silver clips or crumpled in a pocket, a scavenged coin or two, nickels pilfered from a pay phone.<br><br>Train after train steamed into Union Station, belching out tourists. Folks at home depended on the radio, the ticket to the world. Today's show would reconvene the tots who'd been the littlest humans breathing, premature babies so small you could scarcely imagine a heart, a lung, a soul. They'd spent the summer of '33 sleeping and cooing in Martin Couney's sideshow on the midway. "Living Babies in Incubators"-the sign so big you'd have to be dead to miss it. Just next door, inside the Streets of Paris, Sally Rand was doing her scandalous fan dance that made her look naked, but Martin Couney had something most of these people had never seen before.<br><br>Saving a two-pound person was a neater trick than swallowing a dagger or eating a flame. Most hospitals were not equipped to do it. And even if they were, you couldn't barge in off the street. So every day, the crowds paid a quarter to see the preemie sideshow. Housewives, dressed up in their prettiest slim-waist prints, salesmen who'd blown into town from Topeka and Canton and Scranton on a junket, schoolmarms in their sensible shoes, the farmhands and the factory men, swoony schoolgirls dragging the boys from the block, society gals in their slouchy hats, stenographers and operators, grannies and aunties and sticky brats. With luck, they got to watch the nurses feed or bathe the patients. The French nurse, Madame Recht, would flash a diamond ring and slip it over an infant's wrist, all the way up its skinny arm, to demonstrate scale.<br><br>Today, the "graduates" included forty-two "lusty-lunged boys and girls of all nationalities and assorted colors," according to the press release. Singles, twins, a sole surviving triplet. Plus, a VIP: Miss May Winter, class of '01, from Dr. Couney's show at the Buffalo World's Fair. Thirty-three-year-old spinster worked in the travel department at Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co.-point being, she was normal. Productive. These babies could grow up to be like anybody else. They didn't have to die.<br><br>Martin Couney had been selling this idea forever. Anyone who'd ever bought a pickle in Atlantic City or spent a salty day at Coney Island had heard of this guy. Babies came straight from the bloody birthing beds and overburdened hospitals-infants who doctors swore would die, or swore would die without him. No other hope. Back in the aughts, before half of these people remembered, he used to exhibit in Chicago's fun-parks. Jolly kind of fellow. European. Pretty much everyone thought he was swell. Excepting some of the members of the medical establishment. Many had simply ignored him. Others were made uneasy-the way he practiced next to the din of the chute-the-chutes and freak shows, making a spectacle of the weaklings, even if he saved them.<br><br>Today's show could change his reputation. At a quarter of one-live from the Century of Progress!-two unimpeachable doctors would join him on the midway and publicly agree about the way to save these babies. No, not with sideshows, but yes, with incubators-as Martin had been saying all along-and yes, with dedicated care, and yes, indeed, with public money. The script included Dr. Julius Hess, the director of Sarah Morris Children's Hospital at Michael Reese and head of Chicago's Medical Society. Formidable. And Dr. Herman Bundesen, the health commissioner, a man who was known to be mighty fond of the microphone himself.<br><br>Plus, this show was going coast to coast, riding on the airwaves out above the dusty plains, the sharecropped farms, the railroad beds, the tenements, the crystal-and-teacup avenues, the shantytowns, the ranches with their cattle stock, the tidy homes and offices, the luncheonettes and smoky joints in all the little cities all across the USA.<br><br>For today, the radio host would keep his cool and wipe his brow and hold the laughs in check.<br><br>Martin Couney, in his custom quarters-air-conditioned-on the midway, had every conceivable reason to be in a splendid mood. Here came his moment, and could you believe it? Everything he�d ever done was leading up to this. All those years of eminences looking down their noses, as if it were in questionable taste to save a life. Tawdry, they called him. Unscientific. Up to something fishy, just because he�d gotten rich. Not once had he billed the parents of his patients a nickel. No matter what color, religion, or class-penthouse or alley-he�d saved them the same. The audience paid, and if he�d made money, what business was it of anyone else?<br><br>They'd tried to shut him down and shut him up. They'd painted him a rogue and a risible figure. Yet several doctors had spent a summer learning from him, a fact they conveniently liked to forget. Only Julius Hess had been his faithful ally, all the way back to those long-ago days in Chicago, both men young and hopeful.<br><br>How many babies had gone to their graves? Chicago was one thing, New York was even worse. The rest of the country, forget it. First, they said the incubators didn't make a difference and then they stopped to question if these babies were worth it. It wasn't as if there was any shortage of hungry mouths to feed. Why sweat these small ones, who might be a burden?<br><br>Over in the Great Hall within the Hall of Science, the public could view a display explaining eugenics. Propagation of the fittest. Selective human breeding would eliminate the "feeble," the "degenerate," the possibly defective. Also in the hall, the fine men of science were showing pickled fetuses for public edification. And yet, the infant incubators counted as amusement.<br><br>Martin was growing old in this endeavor. At sixty-four, he was losing his hair, while his girth had grown thick. For thirty-odd years, he and his wife, Maye, along with Louise-"Madame" to the public-had executed every clever stunt they could concoct to get the press to show up. Every day that no one paid attention was a day that children died.<br><br>To hell with the heat. He dressed with Old World elegance, no matter the weather. What he lacked in height, he made up for in comportment. Some might say he should reduce, but where was the need? His work was his life, but a man had to eat. The steam that arose from a redolent plate; the bouquet of a fine, aged wine; and a table filled with guests-there was possibly nothing better than that. Except for a baby.<br><br>A baby!<br><br>All the world loves a baby-this was his slogan, written at the door to every show. To gauge by the crowds, it was true, at least when Maye made the babies delicious to look at, with ribbons and bows. But no one-not Maye or Louise, not even, perhaps, the parents themselves-appeared to adore a baby more than he did. The light in the eyes, the fragile breath, the cheeks. The initial sparks of cognition. And then the chubby toddlers who were brought back to visit. More recently, the creamy invitations: a high school graduation, the wedding of someone no one but he and Louise and Maye believed would see a single birthday.<br><br>Every blistering, footsore day, he would station himself at the door to his show-All the world loves a baby! Once seen, never forgotten! He never got tired of talking to the public, not even the Dummkopfs who deduced he'd made the little critters. (Hiya, Doc, where'dja get the eggs?) Sometimes they wanted to order one fresh for themselves.<br><br>To terrified parents, he offered reassurance. Maybe their child was the weight of a little undercooked brisket, maybe the obstetrician shook his head. Martin promised life. And sure enough, most of the patients went home in a couple of months, daintily dressed by his wife. Maye, a highly trained R.N., would give instructions (feed every two hours, love all the time). He would proffer a glossy autographed photo of himself, signed "Uncle Martin" or "Your foster father." Louise would sign her likeness "Aunt Louise."<br><br>Maye avoided cameras. She tended the babies and kept the books and managed all the rest of it-the nurses, wet nurses, supplies, the business end. She didn't have a word in the radio script, but she would be plenty busy today.<br><br>Maye knew this reunion was costing a fortune. Her husband was extravagant-give him a dollar and he would spend three. Today, they were serving an elegant luncheon to more than forty people. Forty-two silver cups had been engraved, to be presented to the babies.<br><br>Every day, Martin saw the money coming in at the gate, which was tremendous, but she saw the bills. No expense was spared, no possible corner cut or tucked inside the nursery. And every night, while the Deco lights blazed on the midway, they hosted multiple seatings at dinner, for staff and wet nurses, and always the guests. Medical men who might think twice, and then again, before endorsing her husband in public wouldn't say no to filling their bellies at his table. He'd courted them relentlessly, for all the years she'd known him. Back home in New York, he favored high-end restaurants, but here in Chicago, they rarely left the fairgrounds.<br><br>Martin loved to cook. He could make a feast, he said, from nothing-a soup bone. But in his midway kitchen they had plenty more than bones. His palate was discerning: He knew one fancy mustard from the next. These midwestern eaters, raised the way Maye had been, on pork chops and corn, might find themselves developing a hankering for gourmet delectations.<br><br>Julius and Clara Hess were often at their table, along with Herman Bundesen, as well as Morris Fishbein, the editor of the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association. Morris liked to bring along his daughter Barbara. That young lady would never forget les escargots.<br><br>For today�s radio program, Martin was going to play it graciously modest. Fluent in French and German, exuberant in English, he could be jolly Uncle Martin, or courtly, or worldly, as needed. Reporters and tablemates swallowed his personal story, which he continued to perfect. Born in France or Germany (depending on who was asking). Often enough, he said Alsace. Matriculated in Berlin and Leipzig, two notably scientific cities. From there, he went to Paris to apprentice with a world-renowned doctor, Pierre-Constant Budin. Yes, his medically educated tablemates had heard of that name.<br><br>In 1896, he said, Budin sent his handpicked, German-speaking prot&#x17d;g&#x17d; (that would be himself) to the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin with the mission of showing a new invention. Budin had developed infant incubators and was using them with great success at Paris Maternit&#x17d;. Young Martin had a vision: Rather than display the incubators vacant, he would demonstrate with living, breathing preemies, borrowed from a German charity ward. He called the exhibit Kinderbrutanstalt-"child hatchery"-and before it even opened, it had inspired drinking hall songs. The show itself, he would later say, outdrew the Congo Village and the Tyrolean yodelers.<br><br>Enter a British impresario named Samuel Schenkein. This dandy showbiz genius, having seen the child hatchery, invited Martin to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, to be held in London the following year. Budin gave his blessing, and the show was another smash.</p><h2>2 Practice Tests for the CogAT - Form 7 - Grade 2 (Level 8): TWO FULL LENGTH Practice Tests for GRADE 2 (Practice Test for the CogAT - Form 7 - Grade 2)</h2><p>EDITION 2 This book offers TWO full length practice tests (Practice Test 1 &amp; Practice Test 2) for CogAT� Form 7 - Level 8 for Grade 2 * Kindles and hones reasoning and problem-solving skills * Builds confidence through practice and familiarity with the test format * Important test taking tips and suggestions! * Answer Key included! - Verbal (Picture Analogies, Sentence Completion, Picture Classification ) - Quantitative (Number Analogies, Number Puzzles, Number Series) - Figurative (Figure Matrices, Paper Folding, Figure Classification) 236 pages</p><p></p><h2>Wildsam Field Guides: New Orleans (American City Guide Series)</h2><p>Wildsam Field Guides: New Orleans leads travelers into the most authentic experience of the one-of-a-kind Louisiana city, working closely with an eclectic team of trusted locals.

In fact, not one person who has tried this secret has failed to win.&#x201d; Suppose I then gave you their names and you were able to verify that all of us had indeed won mega lottery jackpots. Now, what would you be willing to do to learn the secret I&#x2019;ve offered to share with you? How much would you be willing to pay me? Would you be willing to take out a second mortgage on your house to get the necessary funds, or borrow from your 401(k) retirement plan? What if I then told you that I didn&#x2019;t want your money or your house . . . I just wanted you to read a book that I wrote in which I revealed the secret? If I told you that the secret was revealed in chapter 7 of my book, and I handed you that book right now, how much time would you let go by before you would read chapter 7?What if you knew the next mega jackpot was only one day away? When would you get around to reading chapter 7 now? With what level of attention would you read each paragraph in that chapter?<br>That is like the secret I intend to reveal in this book. During the past twenty years, I have made tens of millions of<br>dollars in personal income. Along with my partners, I&#x2019;ve had the thrill of starting businesses from scratch (with a few thousand dollars) and building them into companies that have produced billions&#x2014;yes, billions&#x2014;of dollars in sales. And making money through one&#x2019;s own hard work and effort is certainly a lot more fulfilling than winning it in a lottery or at the tables in Vegas. Although winning a pot of money in a stroke of luck may give you a greater thrill initially, that thrill is gone almost as fast as it comes, and the personal and financial losses that usually follow such a windfall can be devastating. Moreover, I&#x2019;ve never heard of someone winning a mega lottery a second time.<br>This being the case, if you were my friend, I would much rather give you the keys you need to succeed in business, marriage, parenting, and life than give you the secret to winning a lottery. And if I <i>really </i>cared about you, I&#x2019;d lead you step by step through the process of applying these keys to success to the most important areas of your life.<br>My business success, like my personal happiness, has been the result of the incredible relationships that have come into my life over the past forty-four years, and the wisdom and benefits that have been handed down to me as a result of those personal relationships. But there is one secret that I&#x2019;ve rarely shared. Not <i>one </i>of these relationships, nor any of the blessings they have given me, would have come about had I not <i>first </i>met the greatest man who ever lived.<br><br> <i>Embracing Extraordinary Change<br><br></i>During my business life I have traveled millions of miles on our nation&#x2019;s airlines. I have spent thousands of hours talking with men and women seated next to me about countless subjects. I&#x2019;ve heard them complain about their jobs, their spouses, their children, their bosses, and of course their lives in general. When they find out that I&#x2019;m that rare person who is happy beyond description, more in love with my wife today than I was during our courtship eighteen years ago, and that I persisted through countless failures to create dozens of successful businesses, they often ask me what the &#x201c;secrets&#x201d; to my happiness, my marriage, or my success have been. I tell them that it all started with what I learned from a homeless carpenter I first met one night in 1964. Their eyes usually widen with interest. When I tell them that the carpenter&#x2019;s name is Jesus, their curiosity quickly turns to bewilderment. But as much as they might like to change the subject initially, their curiosity gets the better of them, and they want to hear<br>&#x201c;the <i>rest </i>of the story.&#x201d;<br>As I begin to describe the life lessons and wisdom I learned from Jesus, their curiosity usually turns to astonishment. &#x201c;Is this guy for real?&#x201d; they seem to be saying to themselves. But as I relate the specific ways in which Jesus miraculously changed my mind and heart, guided me in my relationships and business endeavors, and brought purpose, peace, personal success, and joy into my daily experience, they tend to undergo a transformation of sorts. In part because of the fact that I&#x2018;ve been so successful in the world of business, they are often interested in what has made me so successful. When they hear how my thinking and attitudes and beliefs were shaped by the timeless teachings of Jesus, their bewilderment turns to amazement, their skepticism to open-minded inquiry. But even when they accept my words at face value, they find it hard to believe that I have become all that I am as a result of my relationship with a man who lived two thousand years ago. From these conversations over the years, I have discovered that there is more misunderstanding about Jesus of Nazareth than about anyone I&#x2019;ve ever talked about. Most people regard him as a religious leader, the founder of Christianity. Others view him simply as a great teacher of morality. Some are so unfamiliar with historical texts and documents that they think of him as nothing more than a myth or legend. But regardless of their opinions about Jesus, nearly all of them tragically misjudge<br>the potential relevance of his life and teachings to their own lives. By thinking of him only as one who is &#x201c;religious,&#x201d; they have failed to discover all that he can do to shape their thinking and inspire their lives. As a result, their lives are often characterized by uncertainty, frustration, failure, anxiety, discouragement, depression, or even despair. The truth is, Jesus was not <i>at all </i>about religion&#x2014;he was <i>all </i>about <i>reality</i>.<br><br> <i>Whom We Walk With<br></i>A young man during the Great Depression walked out of a bank, despondent after he had been turned down for the loan he desperately needed to save his business. As he walked out, he bumped into Henry Ford. Noticing the young man&#x2019;s look of desperation, Ford stopped and asked what was troubling him. The man told him that all the banks he had visited had rejected his application for a loan. Ford simply said, &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d; <br><br>They walked a little farther down the street to yet another bank. This time, as they opened the door, Henry put his arm around the man for just a moment. Henry then called him by name and said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get together soon,&#x201d; loud enough for those in the bank to hear. He then whispered to the young man, &#x201c;Go ask the manager for your loan.&#x201d;<br>The young man quickly replied, &#x201c;But nothing&#x2019;s changed.&#x201d;<br>Henry smiled and said, &#x201c;One thing <i>has </i>changed. . . . The manager saw you with <i>me </i>. . . and believe me, young man, that&#x2019;s all he needed to see.&#x201d; Sure enough, the manager quickly invited the young man into his office and promptly made the loan.<br>A single encounter changed that young man&#x2019;s life. My relationship with Jesus Christ did the same for me, following<br>a single encounter . . . not much different from this young man&#x2019;s. Until that night in 1964, I had thought of Jesus as<br>someone who was all about religion. But that night, he became a personal friend to me, who reached out and simply said, &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d; From that moment, Jesus no more represented a <i>religion </i>to me than Henry Ford represented a religion to that young man. He quickly became my best friend, my mentor and guide, and so much more.</p><h2>I Know What I Am: The Life and Times of Artemisia Gentileschi</h2><p><p><strong>This is a graphic biography of a pioneering woman painter in 17th century Rome.</strong></p> In 17th century Rome, where women are expected to be chaste and yet are viewed as prey by powerful men, the extraordinary painter Artemisia Gentileschi fends off constant sexual advances as she works to become one of the greatest painters of her generation. Frustrated by the hypocritical social mores of her day, Gentileschi releases her anguish through her paintings and, against all odds, becomes a groundbreaking artist. Meticulously rendered in ballpoint pen, this gripping graphic biography serves as an art history lesson and a coming-of-age story. Resonant in the #MeToo era, <em>I Know What I Am</em> highlights a fierce artist who stood up to a shameful social status quo.

This information-dense graphic biography does an excellent job of putting her life and career in its historical and cultural context, a period of tumultuous change and sometimes violently competitive groups of rival artists. Siciliano's portraits and renditions of paintings have marvelous fine detail, made all the more impressive by her medium: ballpoint pen.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Siciliano visually and textually confronts the trauma Gentileschi experienced, while demonstrating the painter&#x2019;s strong will and passion. Without falling prey to the trope of artistic achievement through trauma, this intensely detailed visual biography does justice to a still undervalued artist.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Hyperallergic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Siciliano's exquisite craftsmanship is clear on every page of this consistently engrossing volume, which portrays the artist&#x2019;s plight with affection and urgency.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>I Know What I Am</em> paints an enduring, detailed portrait through a feminist lense of Artemisia as a woman to remember: as a pioneer, as a master of her craft, as a mother, a survivor of injustices due to her gender, and an artist whose surviving works are timeless.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Black Nerd Problems</em></strong></p><h2>The Peculiar Pumpkin Thief (Geronimo Stilton, No. 42)</h2><p><b>The best-selling mouse author Geronimo Stilton is back with another cheesy adventure!</b><br><br>Halloween is a few days away when all of the pumpkins in New Mouse City disappear!

The press coverage of the shooting, as well as the criminal trial that followed, referred to Latisha, assigned male at birth, as Larry. Unpacking the consequences of representing the victim as Larry, a gay boy, instead of Latisha, a trans girl, Gayle Salamon draws on the resources of feminist phenomenology to analyze what happened in the school and at the trial that followed. In building on the phenomenological concepts of anonymity and comportment, Salamon considers how gender functions in the social world and the dangers of being denied anonymity as both a particularizing and dehumanizing act. </p><br><br><p>Salamon offers close readings of the court transcript and the bodily gestures of the participants in the courtroom to illuminate the ways gender and race were both evoked in and expunged from the narrative of the killing. Across court documents and media coverage, Salamon sheds light on the relation between the speakable and unspeakable in the workings of the transphobic imaginary. Interdisciplinary in both scope and method, the book considers the violences visited upon gender-nonconforming bodies that are surveilled and othered, and the contemporary resonances of the Latisha King killing.</p></p><p><b>Gayle Salamon</b> is Professor of English and Gender and Sexuality Studies at Princeton University. She is the author of Assuming a Body: Transgender and Rhetorics of Materiality, which won the Lambda Literary Award for Best Book in LGBT Studies in 2011."With transness facing the threat of possible governmental erasure, I can think of no book more important than Gayle Salamons The Life and Death of LatishaKing. . . . Salamon brilliantly renders how gendered violence, trans erasure, and what the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl calls 'retroactive crossing out' can produce a transphobic imagination." (<i>The Paris Review</i>)<br><br>"Why is there so much hate and transphobic violence in the world? Gayle Salamons new book is a powerful response to this question. . . points towards the difficult task of thinking about forms of difference and the violence that often attends them, and suggests that examining how gender is differently perceived is a crucial step beyond acknowledging that transphobic violence exists." (<i>Medical and Health Humanities</i>)<br><br>"Gayle Salamon's writing in The Life and Death of Latisha King is sparse, giving a sense of stillness and quiet as if every word of the text were heavy with the weight of mourning. Short sentences and simple wording bring the point to the surface,[1] laying bare a reality that readers cannot but contend with ... As a work of critical theory and philosophy, the book continues Salamon's earlier Assuming a Body: Transgender and Rhetorics of Materiality (2010) and makes an important contribution to scholarship in feminist, queer, and trans studies that engages with phenomenology (including by scholars such as Beauvoir, Bettcher, Butler, Diprose, Hein�maa, Stryker, Weiss, Young). Insofar as the book is a personal account of Salamon's experience during the trial and her processing of that experience, it can also be at home alongside works such as Maggie Nelson's The Argonauts (2015) and Claudia Rankine's Citizen (2014) ... The balancing between the heaviness of loss and mourning, and the hope and love that sustain Salamon's account, is noteworthy." (Hypatia)<br><br>"Although the author&#x2019;s primary focus is to carefully study the perception of a brown trans body, delicate passages describing testimonies of Latisha&#x2019;s skill and confidence while gliding in high-heeled boots or a supportive teacher gifting her a green prom dress conjure the child&#x2019;s stunning personhood in a visual field beyond the court proceedings." (The Drama Review)<br><br>"[Salamon] turns our perspective on the trial away from its grueling examination of the gender non-conformity of Latisha King and onto the gendered embodiments of the teachers and attorneys instead." (<i>Lambda Literary</i>)<br><br>"This beautifully crafted work in slow and critical phenomenology allows us to understand the fatal consequences of skewed gender perception. Salamon takes us through the trial of Latisha King, murdered by a classmate who understood transgendered expression as an aggressive assault. Paying close attention to how the participants in the murder trial discuss and enact their normative passions about how the body should appear, Salamon shows us how phenomenological description that open up for strong criticism modes of perception and action that bear lethal consequences for those who contest hegemonic gender norms.

"There were many pie makers in my family, and no one ever needed a recipe&#x2014;they just mixed, rolled out pastry, and baked to perfection," she writes. Surrounded from an early age by her pie-baking mother, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, and neighbors, Foster developed a natural passion for pies. <br><br>Here, reap the rewards of Foster's inspiration: fifty-seven recipes for amazing pies, including the southern classics, each one matched to one of eleven perfect pie crusts. You'll find pies piled with fruit, pies stuffed with nuts, custard and cream pies, icebox pies, tarts and hand pies--and savory pies, too.

The old and the sick, unable to work and feed themselves, died.<br> <br>Soon, nation-states formed, and people organized to defend themselves from invaders.1 But how do you convince people to fight when there is a high likelihood they will die doing so?<br> <br>One way is to bribe them.<br> The First Pension in America<p></p> <br>During the American Revolution, the Continental Congress offered soldiers a monthly lifetime income as an incentive to join General Washington&#x2019;s army. The income they&#x2019;d receive following the war (assuming they survived the ordeal) would be a reward for their service.<br> <br>This lifetime income was called a pension.<br> <br>The colonists didn&#x2019;t invent the idea; it had been used by Romans 2,000 years ago.<br> <br>But the idea was new to Americans: For the first time, you could work for (just) a finite number of years instead of your entire life, after which you&#x2019;d continue to receive income as though you were still employed.<br> <br>As far as Americans were concerned, it was (pardon the pun) a revolutionary idea.<br> <br>The federal government repeated the offer during the Civil War and has done so ever since.<br><br>Pension benefits are still being paid for service in the Civil War. Although the last soldier to fight in that conflict died in 1958, his child (now 94 years old) is still receiving a monthly check from the federal government, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.<br> <br>Ditto for 58 children of veterans of the Spanish-American War (fought in 1898), 2,192 children of World War I veterans and 10,733 kids of WWII vets.<br><br>The first private company to offer a pension plan was American Express, which in 1875 gave an income to each retired employee. The amount was equal to half of the worker&#x2019;s annual pay, based on an average of the worker&#x2019;s final 10 years of employment (up to $500 annually). Over the next 50 years, hundreds of other companies created similar plans.<br> <br>Pensions came to be known as defined benefit plans because the future benefit you are to receive is defined.2 What was undefined was how much it would cost the employer to provide this benefit.<br> <br>Workers came to love pension plans. They paid nothing for them and had to stay with their employer only long enough to qualify (called vesting) &#x2014; typically 20 to 40 years. Employers loved the plans too because they helped ensure that productive workers would stay for an entire career. The higher productivity and lower turnover helped the employer save money.<br> A Retirement Plan for the Public<p></p> <br>Then came the Great Depression. Tens of millions of people were out of work, which created fierce competition for jobs. The nation&#x2019;s economy was agricultural and industrial &#x2014; both very physically demanding &#x2014; placing older Americans at a distinct disadvantage. So when these folks lost their jobs, they were unlikely to find new ones. They thus found themselves permanently &#x2014; albeit involuntarily &#x2014; retired.<br> <br>To provide them with income during their retirement years, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the Social Security Act of 1935 &#x2014; the first public retirement plan. Similar to the private plan created by American Express, Social Security was to pay monthly benefits based on each worker&#x2019;s length of service and average annual wages. The first person to receive a Social Security check was Mary Fuller. Starting in 1940, she received $22.54 monthly &#x2014; and she kept receiving money from Social Security until she died in 1975 at age 100.<br><br>Did I say Social Security was similar to the American Express plan? Actually, there&#x2019;s a big difference: AmEx paid for the benefit it gave its employees, while you pay taxes to support Social Security. Today, in fact, more Americans pay more in Social Security taxes than they do in federal income taxes. And Social Security taxes keep rising. But that&#x2019;s a different book.<br><br>In 2013, nearly 57 million Americans were receiving Social Security benefits, averaging $1,150 monthly. The maximum monthly retirement income was $3,350 as of December 2013, and you must be at least 70 years old to receive it.<br> <br>The benefit is based on your 35 highest-earning years.<br><br>Smoke-and-mirrors alert! The benefit used to be based on your 10 highest-earning years. But the federal government changed the formula to reference 35 years of work. Although earnings are indexed to inflation, workers nevertheless earn a lot less at the start of a career than they do at retirement. So including those early lower-income years in the calculation reduces the amount you receive.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a tricky way for the government to reduce Social Security benefits, and I bet you didn&#x2019;t notice that they changed the formula.<br> <br> How the World&#x2019;s Largest Automobile Manufacturer Changed Retirement Plans Forever<p></p> <br>The Studebaker family of South Bend, Indiana, started making wagons for farmers, miners and the military in 1852. Ten years after the first gasoline-powered car was tested in the United States, the Studebakers began manufacturing automobiles and became, at one point, the world&#x2019;s biggest carmaker. But by the 1960s the company was having financial difficulties, and the last Studebaker car rolled off the assembly line on March 16, 1966.<br><br>NON SEQUITUR WILEY<br> <br><br> <br>NON SEQUITUR � 2012 Wiley Ink, Inc.. Dist. By Universal Uclick. Reprinted with permission. All rights reserved.<br><br>One of Studebaker&#x2019;s problems was that its pension plan had so little money in it that the company couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay all its retirees the pensions they had been promised. So when the company went broke, the pensions ended as well, leaving thousands of employees and retirees with no pension or only a fraction of the amount they had been promised.<br><br>Remember when I said that workers loved pensions because they paid nothing for them? Well, now you&#x2019;re beginning to realize how this hands-off approach came back to haunt them. By leaving all the details to their employers and merely assuming everything would be fine, millions of pensioners found themselves with no pension at retirement &#x2014; and no savings, since they thought they didn&#x2019;t need to save. Big mistake.<br> <br>You can avoid this mistake easily: Don&#x2019;t believe that the promise of a pension alleviates you of the need to save for retirement.<br><br>Studebaker&#x2019;s collapse, along with similar events at other companies, caused Congress to create the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1974.<br> <br>ERISA governs how pension plans operate, to help ensure that promises made to employees are honored by their employers. ERISA also created PBGC, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Similar to the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) for banks, PBGC restores some (not all) of the pension income that workers lose when a company goes out of business.<br> <br>1.

Duh.</p><h2>Democracy and Truth: A Short History</h2><p><p>"Fake news," wild conspiracy theories, misleading claims, doctored photos, lies peddled as facts, facts dismissed as lies&#x2014;citizens of democracies increasingly inhabit a public sphere teeming with competing claims and counterclaims, with no institution or person possessing the authority to settle basic disputes in a definitive way.</p> <p>The problem may be novel in some of its details&#x2014;including the role of today's political leaders, along with broadcast and digital media, in intensifying the epistemic anarchy&#x2014;but the challenge of determining truth in a democratic world has a backstory. In this lively and illuminating book, historian Sophia Rosenfeld explores a longstanding and largely unspoken tension at the heart of democracy between the supposed wisdom of the crowd and the need for information to be vetted and evaluated by a learned elite made up of trusted experts. What we are witnessing now is the unraveling of the d�tente between these competing aspects of democratic culture.</p> <p>In four bracing chapters, Rosenfeld substantiates her claim by tracing the history of the vexed relationship between democracy and truth. She begins with an examination of the period prior to the eighteenth-century Age of Revolutions, where she uncovers the political and epistemological foundations of our democratic world. Subsequent chapters move from the Enlightenment to the rise of both populist and technocratic notions of democracy between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the troubling trends&#x2014;including the collapse of social trust&#x2014;that have led to the rise of our "post-truth" public life. Rosenfeld concludes by offering suggestions for how to defend the idea of truth against the forces that would undermine it.</p></p><p>Sophia Rosenfeld is the Walter H. Annenberg Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania and author of Common Sense: A Political History, which won the Mark Lynton History Prize.<p>"An essential guide to finding the roots of our current predicament, this short book provokes thought rather than simply assigning blame and consequently succeeds in the most important task of all: helping us navigate toward a revival of democracy at the very moment when it seems most under threat."&#x2014;Lynn Hunt, author of <i>History: Why It Matters</i></p><br><br><p>"Brilliantly lucid. . . . [Rosenfeld] provides the historical background necessary to understand our current truth crisis . . . [and] few historians are better positioned to tell this story than Rosenfeld. A professor of intellectual history at the University of Pennsylvania, she has devoted her career to exploring the ways that philosophical conversations during the Enlightenment and the age of revolutions shaped basic modern political concepts and presuppositions."&#x2014;<i>The Nation</i></p><br><br><p>"[E]xcellent and . . . elegantly written . . . Rosenfeld's central insight [is] that there never was a golden age; the relationship between democracy and truth has always been complicated, and has never been firmly settled. Rosenfeld shows that . . . the conflict over epistemic authority has been a structural feature of modern democracy since the beginning."<i>Project Syndicate</i></p><br><br><p>"In her short, sharp book, the historian Sophia Rosenfeld . . . [argues] that ever since its origins in the late 18th century, modern democracy has had a peculiar relationship to truth: the current crisis merely epitomises that. . . . All the biggest challenges of our time are transnational: mass migration, growing inequality, the onset of ecological Armageddon. It's arguable that the politics of the nation state have become at best irrelevant, and at worst a hindrance, to tackling such global challenges. The outlook is grim. Yet it's a tribute to the quality of this pithy, illuminating book that one nonetheless ends it provoked and inspired, rather than dispirited."&#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i></p><br><br><p>"If you are a citizen concerned and not a little confused about the frantic assault on objective truth in today's United States, Sophia Rosenfeld's learned but extremely accessible book is a must-read. Democracy and Truth explains and reveals the historical and intellectual roots of the tension between the two values named in the title, and it shows that truth can prevail&#x2014;but never without a fight."&#x2014;Michael Tomasky, author of <i>Left for Dead: The Life, Death, and Possible Resurrection of Progressive Politics in America</i></p><br><br><p>In <i>Democracy and Truth,</i> Rosenfeld reveals how contestations over truth are part and parcel of the history of democratic theory and practice . . . In illuminating chapters on 'the problem of democratic truth,' intellectual expertise, populism in historical perspective. and 'democracy in an age of lies,' Rosenfeld explains how the democratic idea of truth never quite lived up to its promise of influence by persuasion rather than force. This problem at the core of modern democracies seems to be hidden in plain sight from today's political commentators.&#x2014;<i>Dissent</i></p><br><br><p>"A valuable historical guide to current debates about elitism and populism, <i>Democracy and Truth</i> poses the hardest of questions: can we maintain a constitutional government worthy of a free people in an age of widespread misinformation and fanaticism?"&#x2014;David Bromwich, Yale University</p><br><br><p>"One of our most audaciously gifted historians offers a deep, subtle, and suitably prickly examination of a newly vexing set of issues. Indispensable. Irresistible."&#x2014;Don Herzog, University of Michigan Law School</p><br><br><p>"Surveying the post-Enlightenment era, this incisive account shows that our concerns with "fake news" have a long history, and that democracy and truth have often pulled in opposite directions. Drawing mostly on the American experiment, Rosenfeld analyzes political spin, the idealization of journalistic objectivity, and the echo chambers within which news is either believed or derided. She dives into such eclectic topics as Kant's 'Dare to know!' dictum, lie detectors, and oath-swearing. Rosenfeld's conclusion is sobering: even if the relationship between democracy and truth has long been vexed, the crisis facing Western democracies today is distinctly new."&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></p></p><h2>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</h2><p><p>What does it mean to be a hero?

Scholars already familiar with Nagy&#x2019;s work will not find radically new insights here. What they will appreciate is a systematic and exceptionally lucid statement of the research he has carried out over the past four decades...

Nagy exuberantly reminds his readers that heroes&#x2015;mortal strivers against fate, against monsters, and, as we&#x2019;ll see, against death itself&#x2015;form the heart of Greek literature, the vital counterweight to the gaudy gods and goddesses who so often steal the limelight. He surveys the incredible feast of Greek literature from Homer and Hesiod to the tragedians (his extended analysis of Euripides&#x2019; <i>Hippolytus</i>, for instance, is a wondrous highlight of the book&#x2019;s final marches) and overlays on top of that feast a neat but thin conceit of &#x2018;hours&#x2019; characterized by certain ancient Greek concepts like <i>Kleos</i>, <i>Memnemai</i>, <i>Akhos</i>, <i>Penthos</i>, and <i>Aphthito</i>. The comprehensiveness of his coverage allows him to bring in every variation on the Greek hero, from the wily Theseus to the brawny Hercules to the &#x2018;monolithic&#x2019; Achilles to the valiantly conflicted Oedipus, and that same sweep puts him in a perfect position to spot the linking factors and expound on them.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steve Donoghue</b><b>, </b><b><i>Open Letters Monthly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Backed by formidable learning and a vast ecumenical sweep embellished with details&#x2015;yet written in a winningly readable informal style&#x2015;<i>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</i> offers to us penetrating considerations of the ways in which Greek classics continue to make themselves felt in our lives even today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>M.

Nieto</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;By force of its prestige, the <i>Iliad</i> sets the standard for the definition of the word <i>epic:</i> an expansive poem of enormous scope, composed in an old-fashioned and superbly elevated style of language, concerning the wondrous deeds of heroes. That these deeds were meant to arouse a sense of wonder or marvel is difficult for the modern mind to comprehend, especially in a time when even such words as <i>wonderful</i> or <i>marvelous</i> have lost much of their evocative power. Nor is it any easier to grasp the ancient Greek concept of <i>hero</i> (the English word is descended from the Greek), going beyond the word's ordinary levels of meaning in casual contemporary usage. Who, then, were these heroes? In ancient Greek traditions, heroes were humans, male or female, of the remote past, endowed with superhuman abilities and descended from the immortal gods themselves. A prime example is Achilles. The greatest hero of the <i>Iliad,</i> Achilles was the son of Thetis, a sea-goddess known for her far-reaching cosmic powers. It is clear in the epic, however, that the father of Achilles is mortal, and that this greatest of heroes must therefore be mortal as well. So, too, with all the ancient Greek heroes: even though they are all descended in some way or another from the gods, however many generations removed, heroes are mortals, subject to death. No matter how many immortals you find in a family tree, the intrusion of even a single mortal will make all successive descendants mortal. Mortality, not immortality, is the dominant gene.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>From the book</i></b></p><h2>African American Church Management Handbook</h2><p>Highly regarded pastor Floyd Flake; his wife, co-pastor, author, Elaine Flake; and church chief financial officer Edwin Reed offer a design based on key needs in the black church, and their experience at one of the nation&#39;s most respected and largest black churches, Greater Allen A.M.E.

The whirling whimpus, who once laid low an entire Boy Scout troop. And the hoop snake, who can chase prey at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour and then, with one sting of its venomous tail, cause it to turn purple, swell up, and&#x2014;alas&#x2014;die.<br><br> These and 17 other fearsome creatures are among the most fantastical beasts in American folklore. Their stories, as narrated by one of the last surviving cryptozoologists, are best enjoyed while sitting around a campfire.

He loves monsters and books.</p><br><br><p>Tom Mead is a pen-and-ink artist who exhibits his work under the name "Mr. Mead."</p>DEAR READER,&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is filled with frogs and zebras, and you have probably seen them both in zoos and dissected them both in school. But the world is filled with stranger animals, fearsome creatures too terrifying for most zoologists to understand.&nbsp;I have devoted my life to their study. I am a cryptozoologist and, if I do say so myself, at or near the forefront of my field. So many colleagues have been eaten by chimeras, incinerated by salamanders, or pecked to death by barnacle geese; there is not necessarily much competition left. The focus of my study has been the lumberwoods of North America, a land still wild and untamed at the margin, populated only by lumberjacks and their mortal enemies, the cruel trees that once tyrannized this land&#x2014;and, of course, by fearsome creatures.<p>This book is the fruit of a lifetime of deathdefying feats in the jaws&#x2014;the literal jaws&#x2014;of some of the deadliest animals ever to stroll across the earth, but it is by no means complete. There are many undiscovered, or half-discovered, creatures still extant in this great continent. There is the hidebehind, for example, whose most distinguishing feature is that whenever you look at it, it is hiding behind something. Pecos Bill caught one and donated it to the Cincinnati Zoo; but even then, when researchers tried to study it, the creature was always concealed behind the bars of its cage. There&#x2019;s not much to say about such a beast; not much is known, so I also left the hidebehind out. I left out the slink and the ring-tailed tooter. There are enough fearsome creatures in this continent to fill sixty or eventy books such as this one. I sometimes marvel that anyone makes it to the grocery store and back alive.&nbsp;</p><br> THE HODAGWhile he lived, Paul Bunyan served as the master of the Michigan lumberwoods; since his death, its only master has been the hodag. Three thousand pounds of pure carnivorous appetite, the hodag most resembles a bull-horned rhinoceros with a spiny back.<br><br> There are larger creatures in North America, and there are faster creatures in North America, but there is nothing that can challenge a hodag. I almost owned a hodag, or a part of a hodag&#x2014;more or less. A smooth talker named WellbornT. Herder had a plan to capture and exhibit the hodag as part of a traveling amusement show, and he sought me out as a potential investor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I will invest in your scheme,&#x201d; I told him,&#x201c;if you can answer three simple questions about Browne&#x2019;s Pseudodoxia.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what that is,&#x201d; said Herder, so I threw him out the door. But he did eventually find a backer, a mantis wrangler named Constantine Vosko, and the two conspirators twirled their mustachios and discussed their plans. With Vosko&#x2019;s cash, Herder bought a large tent, painted outside and in with colorful, borderline realistic pictures of the hodag, breathing fire (impossible!) and swallowing people by the busload (possible). The tent fit in the back of a large truck they would take turns driving. Oh,they were clever fellows.&nbsp;<br><br> Herder and Vosko would roll into town with the truck&#x2019;s sound system blaring.<br><br> "See the wild hodag! Nature's fierces antagonist! <i>Absolutely not for children!"</i><br><br> They set up the painted tent and charged a sawbuck (that&#x2019;s $10) for entrance. The hodag, Herder explained to the packed house, was behind this curtain here, and he would be leading the beast out, in chains, very shortly&#x2014;but first a description of the terror that is the hodag! &nbsp;<br><br> At that moment, Vosko, crouched behind the curtain, pressed play on the terrifying field recordings of the grunts and screams&#x2014;the roaring! the snarling!&#x2014;of a young wild hodag. Herder, dressed in the sequined cape of a circus daredevil, regaled the audience with tales of hodags ripping up trees by the roots and redirecting rivers with their great horns. And as he spoke, the sound of the hodag would reach a crescendo, until, at the precise moment, Vosco would rattle chains and shout from the back&#x2014;<p>&#x201c;Have mercy on us ALL! The hodag's escaped!&#x201d;</p>At this point he would pull a lever and the tent would half-collapse. The terrified townsfolk would bolt out the way they&#x2019;d entered, leaving Herder and Vosko to roll up the tent quickly and jam it into the tractor trailer, their pockets filled with ten-spots. No one ever stayed around to demand a refund. And Herder and Vosko were off to another town, with another group of gulls to defraud with their hodag noises and their showmanship. They crisscrossed the Midwest with this act, fleecing towns and congratulating each other.<br> If Herder had known that Browne&#x2019;s Pseudodoxia was a classic seventeenth-century treatise on the history of errors, especially the history of errors concerning fearsome creatures (which he did not), he would have received my expert advice; and my expert advice would have been for them to stay the heck out of Michigan.<br></p><h2>The Icky Bug Alphabet Board Book</h2><p>Learn your ABCs in this &#x201c;icky&#x201d; exploration of all the creepy crawly insects from A to Z.

Rather, there are a variety of factors that are implicated in much criminal offending, some fairly obvious like poverty, mental illness, and drug abuse and others less so, such as neurocognitive problems. Today, we have the tools for effective criminal behavioral change, but this cannot be an excuse for criminal offending. In The Future of Crime and Punishment, William R. Kelly identifies the need to educate the public on how these tools can be used to most effectively and cost efficiently reduce crime, recidivism, victimization and cost. <br><br>Since the first publication of The Future of Crime and Punishment in 2015 there have been some significant changes in American criminal justice. While some efforts are moving in the right direction they are still nowhere close to meaningful criminal justice reform that focuses on large scale diversion and appropriate, expert treatment and rehabilitation of the majority of offenders. In this updated paperback edition, Kelly provides readers with updated crime, recidivism and the cost of crime statistics; notes the recent trends such as the modest reduction in incarceration; and discusses the impacts of the election of Trump, including his &#x201c;law and order&#x201d; stance as a candidate, his blurring of crime and immigration, the Justice Department&#x2019;s renewed war on drugs and the opioid crisis by emphasizing a criminal justice response to a public health problem.<br>The justice system of the future needs to be much more collaborative, utilizing the expertise of a variety of disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, addiction, and neuroscience. The path forward is one characterized largely by change from traditional criminal prosecution and punishment to venues that balance accountability, compliance, and risk management with behavioral change interventions that address the primary underlying causes for recidivism. Moreover, it requires a radical shift in how we think about crime and punishment. Our thinking needs to reflect a perspective that crime is harmful, but that much criminal behavior is changeable.</p><p>William R. Kelly, PhD, is a professor in the Department of Sociology and director of the Center for Criminology and Criminal Justice Research at the University of Texas at Austin, Texas. He is also a fellow with the Darrell K. Royal Regents Chair in Ethics and American Society, University of Texas at Austin. Kelly is the author and contributor of several books and articles on criminal justice, law, and policy, including Criminal Justice At The Crossroads: Transforming Crime and Punishment (2015) and Justice Under Pressure: Prison Crowding, Parole Release and Recidivism in Texas (1993).Sociology professor Kelly provides a well-reasoned, if familiar, critique of the American criminal justice system, along with thoughtful prescriptions for revolutionary reform. Despite the trillions the U.S. has spent over the last four decades on criminal justice and the war on drugs, crime has not been significantly reduced. For Kelly, that failure is inextricably linked with the system&#x2019;s focus on punishment, which often includes incarceration, as a response to criminal behavior. Such policies ignore many reasons for criminality, including substance abuse, mental illness, and poor education, and Kelly is persuasive in describing how 'behavior change interventions... can reduce crime, recidivism, victimization, and cost.' His balanced approach, which includes an understanding of the historical and societal forces that led to the Nixon-era War on Crime and its successor. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Between 1972 and 1984, state and federal prison populations doubled. From 1984 to 1992, incarceration doubled again. Then it doubled once more from 1992 to the present. This represents a pinnacle in a sordid kind of way: the land of the free has been for some years now the most punitive nation in modern times. Meanwhile, the recidivist rate is awful. Why has the so-called correctional system gone so wrong? In this brilliant book, Kelly, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin, has a lot to say. His book is less about the future of crime and punishment than an analysis of the country's defective status quo. Kelly observes that crime occurrences have complex antecedents&#x2014;neurological, psychological, and social. Punishment has little utility in reducing crime, he believes. But the recipe for carceral excess has been perfected: choose incarceration as the punishment of choice for a growing list of crimes. Ignore factors like drug and alcohol addiction, mental illness, and intellectual capacity in sentencing. Next, dump offenders in facilities where transformative treatment, if any, is dubious. Then, release offenders to the community without full support. They'll come back; we'll pay. Summing Up: Essential. All levels/libraries. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>In The Future of Crime and Punishment: Smart Policies for Reducing Crime and Saving Money, William Kelly tells us where crime and justice policy has been and where it needs to go. Drawing on a wealth of scholarship, Kelly incisively diagnoses the misdirections and misspending that have left America holding the tab, with far too little to show for it. More importantly, he identifies critical lessons from mistakes of the past and presents compelling, research-based strategies for advancing public safety and justice. (Daniel P. Mears, Professor of Criminology at Florida State University)<br><br>Consensus now exists that the punishment paradigm that guided American criminal justice policy for four decades is bankrupt. William Kelly diagnoses why this is so but, more importantly, instructs us on how, at this unique policy turning point, to be smart rather than tough on crime. Clearly written and compellingly argued, this volume is an invaluable resource for scholars and ideal for classroom use. (Francis T. Cullen, Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus, University of Cincinnati)<br><br>William Kelly offers a comprehensive, insightful look into the world of criminal justice that is presented in layman terms. This work can be easily comprehended by the student learner and yields information that is valuable for the seasoned practitioner. Kelly grabs the reader from the initial pages and maintains that level of engagement as he takes the reader on a historical journey through the US criminal justice system &#x2013; hitting on major political and policy elements that have contributed to mass over-incarceration. His perspective is extremely accurate and on target. In addition to discussing the problem with the current state of corrections within the United States criminal justice system, Kelly shares plausible solutions which build upon contemporary models that have enjoyed some success. This book is a must read for everyone who has ever considered our criminal justice system and asked "how did we get here?" or "how can we fix it?". (Maxine L. Bryant, Phd, professor of criminal justice, Armstrong State University, Savannah, GA)<br><br>This book is a must read for anyone interested in understanding why punishment alone will not work in changing criminal behavior. William Kelley offers a thought provoking analysis of the criminal justice system and provides a road map for changing how we do business.

If these women want something to happen, it happens. Now one of their own is being considered for the U.S. Supreme Court, and the ladies don&#x2019;t want anything from the past, including their own sometimes violent activities, to be examined during the vetting process, let alone destroy their friend&#x2019;s chances of being appointed. Political intrigue, high-level high jinks, and characters with charisma to spare make this book a real crowd-pleaser. Michaels&#x2019; long-running series dramatizing the clout of true friendship will also appeal to readers who enjoy other gal-pal stories, such as Dolores Stewart Riccio&#x2019;s Circle of Five (2003) and Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez&#x2019;s Dirty Girls Social Club (2003).

Offering an unflinching account of race and representation, Frank B. Wilderson III asks whether such films accurately represent the structure of U.S. racial antagonisms. That structure, he argues, is based on three essential subject positions: that of the White (the &#x201c;settler,&#x201d; &#x201c;master,&#x201d; and &#x201c;human&#x201d;), the Red (the &#x201c;savage&#x201d; and &#x201c;half-human&#x201d;), and the Black (the &#x201c;slave&#x201d; and &#x201c;non-human&#x201d;). Wilderson contends that for Blacks, slavery is ontological, an inseparable element of their being. From the beginning of the European slave trade until now, Blacks have had symbolic value as fungible flesh, as the non-human (or anti-human) against which Whites have defined themselves as human. Just as slavery is the existential basis of the Black subject position, genocide is essential to the ontology of the Indian. Both positions are foundational to the existence of (White) humanity.<p></p><p>Wilderson provides detailed readings of two films by Black directors, <i>Antwone Fisher</i> (Denzel Washington) and <i>Bush Mama</i> (Haile Gerima); one by an Indian director, <i>Skins</i> (Chris Eyre); and one by a White director, <i>Monster&#x2019;s Ball</i> (Marc Foster). These films present Red and Black people beleaguered by problems such as homelessness and the repercussions of incarceration. They portray social turmoil in terms of conflict, as problems that can be solved (at least theoretically, if not in the given narratives). Wilderson maintains that at the narrative level, they fail to recognize that the turmoil is based not in conflict, but in fundamentally irreconcilable racial antagonisms. Yet, as he explains, those antagonisms are unintentionally disclosed in the films&#x2019; non-narrative strategies, in decisions regarding matters such as lighting, camera angles, and sound.</p></p><p>""Red, White &amp; Black" is unique, incisive, and thought-provoking. The analytic frameworks that Frank B. Wilderson III develops surpass the conventional paradigms for exploring theory, race, power, and film in U.S. culture."--Joy James, editor of "Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy"<p>Frank B.

In introduced a revolutionary new approach to psychological thinking- Primal Therapy, which encourages patients to relive core experiences instead of taking refuge from reality in a comfortable half-world of neurosis. Twenty years on, THE NEW PRIMAL SCREAM takes the theory even further, showing that repressed pain is bad not only for mental but also for physical health. Citing case histories, Dr Janov shows how the application of his therapy has helped victims of incest and other abuse overcome subsequent illness. The implications are as devastating as the therapy is revolutionary.<br>THE NEW PRIMAL SCREAM discusses and reaches some startling conclusions about illness and Primal Therapy, exploring; *Primal pain: the great hidden secrets, *Repression: the gates of the brain and loss of feeling, *How early experience is imprinted, *Illness as the silent scream, *Sex, sensuality and sexuality, *The role of weeping in psychotherapy, *Why we have to relive our childhood to get well.</p></p><p>Dr Arthur Janov is currently director of the Primal Training Centre in California. He is concluding a musical for the stage called SCREAM! and is in the process of creating a film-video series, THE UNIVERSE OF THE MIND.For a new generation of neurotics (psychotherapists included), psychologist Janov ( The Primal Scream , Putnam, 1970) recycles his famous psychophysiological cure-all for mental illness: primal therapy, widely known as scream therapy. He sticks to his original premise that pain experienced from unfulfilled needs produces an unreal, unfeeling self constantly at war with the real self. However, he now claims his theory has been validated by scientific studies in the fields of immunology, weeping, cancer, and brain science. Janov blends case studies with exposition on repression, imprinting, birth trauma, the difference between "normal" and "neurotic," and a discussion on bogus primal therapists. Along the was he disparages New Age rebirthers and most conventional therapies. Controversial remarks abound, such as, "Optimism . . . may only be a good defense." There's even an oblique reference to the cause of sudden infant death when Janov describes how the terror of being in a dark room alone can trigger earlier birth trauma. Twenty years later, he's still revolutionary, articulate, and maybe right.

He holds a Ph.D. from Harvard and a J.D. from Columbia Law School.<br>Josh Baron is the editor in chief of <i>Relix</i> magazine and contributes to a variety of media outlets including New York City&#x2013;based radio station WPUV, where he serves as a music reviewer.<b>THE CHAIRMAN HAD SPOKEN</b><p></p><p>On the evening of August 3, 2010, Irving Azoff, whose role as chief executive officer of Ticketmaster had recently expanded following an industry altering merger that furnished the new title of Live Nation executive chairman, bypassed the company&#x2019;s publicity firm to offer his first direct message to ticket buyers via the social networking service Twitter.</p><p>Azoff&#x2019;s comments fell in the midst of what looked to be the most miserable U.S. summer concert season on record. Weak ticket sales had forced the cancellation of numerous high&#x2013;profile performances, starting with a series of stadium shows by Azoff&#x2019;s longtime management client the Eagles on a bill with country superstars the Dixie Chicks and Keith Urban. In the weeks that followed a number of &#x201c;recession&#x2013;proof&#x201d; acts did the same, as the Jonas Brothers, Rihanna and Lilith Fair all canceled multiple dates. Limp Bizkit scrapped its U.S. amphitheater tour and Christina Aguilera soon followed suit, citing &#x201c;prior commitments.&#x201d; Even the annual American Idols Live! outing, which had blown out tickets in prior years, was forced to scale back its itinerary, dropping seven shows and rescheduling many others.</p><p>Entertainment reporters and Wall Street pundits alike took particular interest in the flagging amphitheater sales figures since most of these &#x201c;sheds&#x201d; were under the control of Live Nation. The summer of 2010 represented the first official go&#x2013;round for the blended company after the government had approved the union of the world&#x2019;s largest live event promoter, Live Nation, with the world&#x2019;s largest ticketing agency, Ticketmaster (which had recently acquired the world&#x2019;s largest artist management firm, Azoff&#x2019;s Front Line).</p><p>The Department of Justice&#x2019;s ruling had been preceded by nearly eleven months of inquiry and two congressional hearings. In February 2009, shortly after the corporations announced their intent to unite, Azoff had been summoned to Capitol Hill in a moment that echoed former Ticketmaster CEO Fred Rosen&#x2019;s 1994 appearance before Congress in the wake of a public dustup with Pearl Jam. However, unlike the earlier inquiry, which in many respects resulted from the fight over a nickel, by 2009 billions of nickels were in play. As a result, both the House Subcommittee on Antitrust and the House Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy elected to weigh in on the matter.</p><p>Ultimately though, it fell to the Obama White House and his Department of Justice to determine whether to block the merger as an illegal restraint of trade. The federal government eventually granted its permission over the strident objections of opponents, who charged that the mega&#x2013;company would raise prices and inhibit the development of new musical artists. By August 2010 a growing segment of the financial community began offering its own criticism, as initial optimism regarding the prospects of Live Nation Entertainment was falling in tandem with the rate of ticket sales.</p><p>Over the course of the summer the company had taken a series of increasingly desperate measures to draw audiences into its amphitheaters. Package deals that offered coupons for a free soda and a hot dog gave way to mid&#x2013; June&#x2019;s &#x201c;No Services Fees&#x201d; promotion, which proclaimed, &#x201c;Your summer concert tickets at Live Nation amphitheaters now have No Service Fees&#x201d; (even as an asterisk qualified, &#x201c;Parking, shipping and other non &#x2018;service fee&#x2019; costs may apply&#x201d;).</p><p>In late July the company instituted a $10 ticket program, which dropped prices even lower, scrambling to achieve a short&#x2013;term financial benefit that led some prior ticket holders to grouse about their decision to purchase seats during initial sales at much greater expense.</p><p>When the expected windfall wasn&#x2019;t realized, Live Nation then outfitted employees with sandwich boards and paraded them through its venues, tickets in hand, hawking the cheap seats for future shows. Yet despite all of this, sales figures remained low as audiences were uncomfortable with the overall price structure of the concert experience.</p><p>In the face of these events, at 10:53 p.m. on August 3, Executive Chairman Azoff shared his sentiments with the public via the immediacy of Twitter.</p><p>&#x201c;So if you want ticket prices to go down stop stealing music.&#x201d;</p><p>Seemingly absolving his company of responsibility, Azoff placed the burden squarely on the overburdened shoulders of consumers. This wasn&#x2019;t the first time he had conveyed such a message. A few weeks earlier, at <i>Fortune</i> magazine&#x2019;s Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen, he had shared similar thoughts about his customer base with the magazine&#x2019;s managing editor: &#x201c;If they could figure out a way to steal the tickets they would, just like they steal movies and music. But so far they haven&#x2019;t figured out how to do that.&#x201d;</p><p>The declining sales of recorded music held deep significance for Azoff, who in addition to running Front Line Management had previously headed both MCA and Giant Records. Still, few concertgoers appreciated his sentiment, flustered and frustrated as they were by parking costs, concession prices, $5 add&#x2013;ons for the &#x201c;luxury&#x201d; of a short, ordered line into the venue, as well as the very price of tickets themselves, with their vexing array of fees. Consumers pointed, for instance, to Lady Gaga&#x2019;s Monster Ball tour, in which a single $20 lawn ticket could cost nearly $50 after a &#x201c;facility charge&#x201d; ($12), &#x201c;convenience charge&#x201d; ($10.05), &#x201c;order processing fee&#x201d; ($5.20) and &#x201c;TicketFast Delivery,&#x201d; i.e., print&#x2013;at&#x2013;home ticketing ($2.50).</p><p>The sheer magnitude of it all had led one would&#x2013;be concertgoer to profess in an online forum, with equal measures of humor and irritation, &#x201c;Screw Live Nation, I&#x2019;m grabbing these tix <i>after</i> the show.&#x201d;</p><p>Other music fans were baffled by their attempts to ascertain the fundamentals of concert ticket pricing. What is included in a service fee, they wondered, and why does the cost of that service vary with the price of a ticket? Who profits from these extra charges? Why are tickets sold online with impunity for five times their face value? Aren&#x2019;t there laws to protect consumers? Are musicians really scalping their best seats? And what&#x2019;s up with these VIP packages? Where do they find those front row tickets, and who reaps the benefits? Just what is a facility fee, and if the public is paying for renovations of some sort, shouldn&#x2019;t all the amphitheaters be recast in platinum by now? And just how did ticket prices get so <i>high</i> anyhow?</p><p></p></p><h2>The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

We appreciate your understanding of the imperfections in the preservation process, and hope you enjoy this valuable book.</p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>Fighting Fantasy Sorcery Shamutanti Hill</h2><p>PART STORY, PART GAME - PURE ADVENTURE!

Here is Steinberg, as he put it at the time, discovering and inventing a great variety of events: "Illusion, talks, music, women, cats, dogs, birds, the cube, the crocodile, the museum, Moscow and Samarkand (winter, 1956), other Eastern countries, America, motels, baseball, horse racing, bullfights, art, frozen music, words, geometry, heroes, harpies, etc.&#x201d; This edition, featuring a new introduction by Nicholson Baker, an afterword by Harold Rosenberg, and new notes on the artwork, will allow readers to discover this unique and wondrous book all over again.</p><p>Famed worldwide for giving graphic definition to the postwar age, <b>Saul Steinberg </b>(1914&#x2013;1999) had one of the most remarkable careers in American art.

From there, the book unfolds as a set of interlocking mini-essays on Steinberg&#x2019;s favorite and recurring subjects: music and musicians, architecture, the chatter of socialites, the vanity of power and ambition, and the iconography of mid-century America...&nbsp;a critical book in Steinberg&#x2019;s oeuvre, a turning point for the artist.

A fixture at Moscow&#39;s protests and political trials, Lomasko illuminates the inequality and injustice at the heart of contemporary Russian society and gives voice to Russia&#39;s many voiceless citizens. Not content to remain in the capital, she travels the country, visiting schools in dying villages; interviewing sex workers in foundering industrial towns; teaching children at juvenile prisons to draw, all while drawing their stories. Her portraits allow readers to see these people as more than words on paper and to see them as she does: with dignity, compassion, and love. Other Russias is an urgent and poignant work by a major talent.</p><p>Victoria Lomasko was born in Serpukhov, Russia in 1978. She works as a graphic artist and has lectured and written widely on graphic reportage. Lomasko is the coauthor of the book Forbidden Art, which was nominated for the Kandinsky Prize in 2010. She has also co-curated two major art exhibitions The Feminist Pencil and Drawing the Court. Her work has been exhibited in numerous shows in Russia and abroad. She lives in Moscow.Victoria Lomasko's gritty, street-level view of the great Russian people masterfully intertwines quiet desperation with open defiance. Her drawings have an on-the-spot immediacy that I envy. She is one of the brave ones. --Joe Sacco<br><br>Powerful . . . Though Victoria Lomasko's figures are rendered in broad, black-and-white strokes, her depictions of God-fearing old ladies, young skinheads, and striking truckers never fall into the traps of parody, contempt, or stereotype. Her focus on the daily lives of regular people offers a respite from the international fixation on Vladimir Putin who is, after all, only one of a hundred and forty-four million Russians. --Sophie Pinkham, NewYorker.com<br><br>An album of images and impressions of ordinary, unconnected Russian citizens who have unexpectedly found themselves activists . . . Victoria Lomasko is the graphic artist equivalent of the great Svetlana Alexievich, the Nobel Prize winner whose work also records and vivifies the lives of the Invisible and the Angry. --Bob Blaisdell, Russian Life</p><h2>A User&#39;s Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention, and the Four Theaters of the Brain</h2><p>John Ratey, bestselling author and clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, lucidly explains the human brain&#x2019;s workings, and paves the way for a better understanding of how the brain affects who we are. Ratey provides insight into the basic structure and chemistry of the brain, and demonstrates how its systems shape our perceptions, emotions, and behavior. By giving us a greater understanding of how the brain responds to the guidance of its user, he provides us with knowledge that can enable us to improve our lives.<br><br> In<i> A User&#x2019;s Guide to the Brain</i>, Ratey clearly and succinctly surveys what scientists now know about the brain and how we use it. He looks at the brain as a malleable organ capable of improvement and change, like any muscle, and examines the way specific motor functions might be applied to overcome neural disorders ranging from everyday shyness to autism. Drawing on examples from his practice and from everyday life, Ratey illustrates that the most important lesson we can learn about our brains is how to use them to their maximum potential.</p><p>Before consulting with customer service, it's always a good idea to read the manual. Psychiatrist John Ratey has condensed years of research on one of the most intimidating yet ubiquitous pieces of hardware in the world into the ever-handy <i>User's Guide to the Brain</i>. More intellectually stimulating than day-to-day practical, the <i>Guide</i> uses tales from Ratey's practice and other clinical venues, tidbits from neuroscientific research, and plain common sense to suggest how the brain develops and manifests personality and behavior. With section titles like "Free Will and the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus," many readers will feel intimidated, but Ratey is careful to direct his explanations to all--even those without a PhD in neuroanatomy. His interesting four-theater theory of mental function is the most directly practical section of the book, incorporating the author's years of experience with patients into a sensible framework that readers can use to better tune their own systems. Describing the changing of the guard from psychoanalysis to a more biological paradigm, Ratey writes: <blockquote> Neuroscientists have, in a sense, simply taken over the elite, almost clerical office once held by analysts. The language used to describe the brain is, if anything, more opaque than any of the old psychoanalytic terminology, which was itself so obscure that only trained professionals could wade through the literature. Most people never even bother to learn such terminology, deeming that, like the language of the computer scientists of the early 1970s, it is better left to the nerds. </blockquote> Determined to help us overcome our sense of helplessness in matters cranial, Ratey has shown that we can understand ourselves better and can learn quite a bit from the nerds. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>&#x201c;[A]n introduction to neuroscience which sticks to a man-on-the-street vocabulary.&#x201d; --<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>&#x201c;Will explain that mysterious space between your ears . . . in an accessible way.&#x201d; --<i>Psychology Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;Excellent. . . .

He specializes in quality assurance techniques, such as ISO 9000 and HACCP, and has been involved with wine activities and education in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Moldova, Russia, China, Algeria, Australia, Scotland, Ireland, and England.&#34;This is a reference book that I can be truly enthusiastic about. David Bird puts the science of wine into layman&#39;s language. It is comprehensive, interesting, well organised and the language is accessible. As the Wife, the Number Two at Eglantine Vineyard, I am often called upon to lead tour groups, write publicity leaflets, answer media and student enquiries and the like, but am not very heavily involved in the winemaking processes, some of which have remained a mystery to me for the thirty two years that we have been open to the Great British Public. The public can be quite intimidating to the tour guide with just a little knowledge and no easy access to the &#39;fount of all knowledge&#39; - the winemaker. From now on I will have this book close at hand for every tour. It would have been invaluable thirty odd years ago when we were planning to start our vineyard - we had so many questions to ask, so few places to turn to for support. It would have been invaluable again when I took the WSET course, because this book compliments and extends the course work material. And why? The book is so easy to use and so clearly written. It moves at a cracking pace - no need to wade through pages of exemplification, because author David Bird sticks to the point. A brief glance at the Contents pages demonstrates this admirably: each chapter clearly headed and the sub-sections &#39;sign-posted&#39; too. It takes only moments to find the answer to that question which has you stumped before the difficult customer loses interest and wanders off. Chemical formulae, mind-boggling for the non-specialist, are kept to the minimum, and labelled where they do occur. Diagrams, flow charts and photographs abound and are always timely and relevant. I have learned a lot. As for the Winemaker? I am currently battling with the all new and bewildering legislation coming at us. With a background in wine quality control, David Bird is undoubtedly a leading authority on the subject, able to guide us in setting the highest standards for our production processes. What a relief! In chapter 23 he has listed the up to date legislation relating to all that we need to be aware of and comply with, from the growing of the grapes to sending out the wine in bottle. He has even included the dreaded HACCP, for which he has provided a flow diagram and table. We have no hesitation in recommending this book (third edition) unreservedly: to the student of oenology, to the amateur and professional wine grower/maker, to the tour guide, to the wine enthusiast and to the correspondent.&#34; Veronica and Tony Skuriat, Eglantine Vineyard. &#34;This is a book that is worth every penny and I cannot recommend it too highly.&#34; - E.R.Adlard, Chromatographia. &#34;This book is ideally suited to those who require more detailed explanations than can be obtained from the vast array of coffee-table wine books.&#34; - Kym Milne MW. --Hugh Johnson</p><h2>Missionary Warrior: Charles E. Cowman</h2><p>&#x201c;Called to Japan. August 11, 1900, 10:30 a.m.&#x201d;<br><br>When Charles E. Cowman made this notation in his Bible, he did not know how the Lord was going to use him over the next 24 years. From telegraph operator to faith missionary to founder of a missions organization that continues strong today, Cowman&#x2019;s driving force was always for more people to come to know Jesus as their personal Savior. Though his story is more than a century old, his example of a life dedicated to following his Lord, wherever that led him, continues to inspire many people today. <br><br><b>About the Author</b><br>Lettie B. Cowman and her husband, Charles, were cofounders of The Oriental Missionary Society, now One Mission Society. After Charles&#x2019; death in 1924, Mrs. Cowman collected devotions that she wrote during his illness and published <i>Streams in the Desert</i>, one of the best-selling devotionals of all time. In addition to <i>Missionary Warrior</i> and <i>Streams in the Desert</i>, she published a number of other books and served as President of The Oriental Missionary Society from 1928 through 1949.</p><p></p><h2>Home Staging for Profit: How to Start a Six Figure Home Staging Business and Begin in 7 Days or Less</h2><p>If you've already taken an expensive seminar on starting a staging business, don't read this.

After leaving school, Leroux worked as a clerk in a law office and, in his free time, began writing essays and short stories. By 1890 he had become a full-time journalist, sailing the world as a correspondent. He began writing novels in the early 1900s and was inspired by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, and Edgar Allan Poe. In 1911, he wrote <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>.<b>Chapter 1: A GHOST? LIKE, SERIOUSLY?!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The terror had been steadily building for weeks. But that chilly January evening marked the turning point no one had anticipated.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, you are no doubt here for the now-legendary tale of a particular pig and her fearless frog. Rest assured, it&#x2019;s a tale you&#x2019;ll get in full. But as with all stage-worthy dramas presented inside the fabled Paris Opera House, it&#x2019;s traditional to have a brief bit of scene setting in order to build anticipation for the leading players to step into the spotlight.<br> &nbsp;<br> I must confess that while I&#x2019;m not exactly traditional, I am indeed a sucker for a soup�on of suspense.<br> &nbsp;<br> So it was on that night, just days after the start of the new year, Monsieur J.P. Grosse was throwing a final gala performance to celebrate his retirement. The gruff impresario, with his plump, pear-shaped head and caterpillar mustache, had been for the last thirty years the manager of the Opera House. But Grosse said that putting up with the fragile egos of the renowned institution&#x2019;s persnickety performers was &#x201c;durn near exhausting&#x201d; and he&#x2019;d had enough of walking on eggshells&#x2014;literally. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s <i>got</i> to start sweeping up after the Swedish Chef, y&#x2019;all,&#x201d; he fumed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, that would all be another manager&#x2019;s headache now. He was rightly relieved that his days of coddling were nearly over&#x2014;but there <i>was</i> one little lady he would miss: Janice Sorelli, the day&#x2019;s reigning diva of dance and one of the Opera&#x2019;s biggest draws. Her performances as prima ballerina left the normally verbose Grosse blissfully speechless. Ditto for Johnny Fiama, the Opera&#x2019;s leading baritone, with whom she frequently shared the stage but whose romantic intentions she barely noticed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The free-spirited Janice paid no mind to the public&#x2019;s praise, or to the adolescent crushes of her costars. She was focused on higher planes of existence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Besides, she already had her eye on a debonair society guy: a handsome frog named Constantine Philippe Georges Marie Comte de Chagny, who had the, like, <i>cutest</i> Russian accent and an adorable mole on his right upper lip. Ironically, Janice&#x2019;s infatuation with the amphibian made Johnny Fiama green with envy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tonight, as the gala progressed onstage, Janice was in her serene and spartan dressing room purifying the air with a white-sage smudge stick. The floor was covered in overlapping Indian rugs, and several beanbags were strewn about for seating. On her dressing table she displayed a collection of multicolored crystals, a Chianti bottle with a candle in its neck, and a &#x201c;Save the Whales&#x201d; petition she&#x2019;d been circulating.<br> &nbsp;<br> Clad in a denim miniskirt, flower-print poncho, and macram� choker, her blond hair pulled into a jaunty side pony, Janice waved a feather to spread the smoke from the smoldering herbs into all the corners. She&#x2019;d performed a groovy improvised farewell dance as the gala&#x2019;s curtain-raiser and was ready to mellow out. When she was done smudging, she gently tamped the bundle into an oyster shell on her dressing table, snuffing it, and took a seat in lotus pose on her yoga mat. Content in her solitude, she breathed deeply and began to chant &#x201c;om&#x201d; on her way into meditation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly into her dressing room flocked half a dozen svelte young chickens that had come up from the stage after dancing <i>La Pulcina Piccola</i>. They flapped in amid great confusion and a flurry of feathers, some breaking into forced nervous laughter, others letting out sharp squawks and <i>bawwwwwwks</i> of fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind them was brash Johnny Fiama, in his doublet and tights, who&#x2019;d followed their act with an aria, as well as Pepino Rodrigo Serrano Gonzales, a suave king prawn from Milan. Tireless Pep� had first made his name as a stage manager in the opera houses of Spain, where his multiple limbs had proven essential in such a multitasking role.<br> &nbsp;<br> Startled out of her becalmed state, Janice exclaimed, &#x201c;<i>Ooooommmmmmm</i>-my gosh!&#x201d; She staggered to her feet and took in the excited mass. &#x201c;Like, wow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The young chicks of the <i>corps</i> marveled at the space, for they were accustomed to being lodged in cramped crates where they spent their time clucking and quarreling, snacking on gnats and the occasional gravel pebble until their nightly half-hour calls.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for Johnny, he was happy in any room with a mirror. Currently, he was staring out from beneath his thick, expressive brows into the looking glass over Janice&#x2019;s dressing table, smoothing his black hair back from his prominent widow&#x2019;s peak, and trying to entice the bohemian babe to glance his way.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Janice was deliberately ignoring him. She was very superstitious, as were many theater folk, and one of her beliefs was that if you looked into a mirror for too long, it could steal your soul. She didn&#x2019;t want to risk witnessing something that grody.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Camilla&#x2014;the little chick with the forget-me-not eyes and fetching rose-red wattle&#x2014;who in a trembling voice finally gave Janice the explanation for the kerfuffle. &#x201c;Bock bock BEGOWWWK,&#x201d; Camilla squawked. Then, with a <i>fouett� rond de jambe en tournant</i>, the dancer swiftly leaped for the dressing-room door. When she landed, she extended a graceful wing and locked the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Muy</i> bouncy, Camilla,&#x201d; said Pep� in his charming Spanish accent. &#x201c;What month were joo hatched?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Camilla told him April.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;S�, of course&#x2014;a spring chicken.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bock bock BEGOWWWK,&#x201d; Camilla squawked again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Janice swept aside her long blond bangs, peered at the petrified chick, and said, &#x201c;Like, what do you mean you actually saw a ghost?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Janice wished she could laugh off Camilla&#x2019;s creeped-out peep, but she shuddered when she heard it. &#x201c;So, like, rilly?&#x201d; she queried. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve, like, actually <i>eyeballed</i> this phantom you&#x2019;re all going on about?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Breathless little Camilla nodded. Her twig-like legs were at that moment giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan onto a beanbag and promptly laid an egg. Pep� scooped it up with one of his four hands, since J.P. Grosse had been on everyone&#x2019;s cases about the shells (plus the prawn could use it to whip up a nice flan later).<br> &nbsp;<br> Once Johnny was satisfied that he&#x2019;d found his best angle in the mirror, he said, &#x201c;Personally, I feel kinda sorry for that ghost. He&#x2019;s so homely, he should be listed in the <i>Guinness Book of Ewwwww</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Janice turned to Johnny. &#x201c;So you saw him, too?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Correctamundo,&#x201d; he said, bestowing upon her his most devastating grin. Hoping to impress her with the bravery of his close encounter, he added, &#x201c;It was like he walked straight through the wall. It&#x2019;s witchcraft, I tell ya, crazy witchcraft. And I&#x2019;ve got no defense for it, the heat is too intense for it . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Janice had tuned him out, though. She was thinking of how the story of the Phantom had inexorably taken hold of the entire Opera family. Everyone was obsessed with the masked figure in a brocade jacket who stalked about the building, from top to bottom, like a shadow; who spoke to nobody, to whom nobody dared speak; and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one knowing how or to where. Most of the chicks had run across the supernatural being at some point, or so they claimed. After all, it was hard to say who had actually seen him and who hadn&#x2019;t&#x2014;there were so many overdressed oddballs at the Opera who were <i>not</i> ghosts . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> The truth is that the idea of the Phantom first came from the description given by Beauregard, a dim but diligent janitor at the theater who really and truly had seen the ghost. He had encountered it on the little staircase by the footlights, the one that led down to the underground floors known as &#x201c;the cellars,&#x201d; which were five in number.<br> &nbsp;<br> To anyone who cared to listen, Beauregard explained in his slow and plodding way: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you&#x2014;it is terrible to behold, you know? Because the thing&#x2019;s skin is blue. Blue!&#x201d; Hitching up his already high-waisted khakis even higher, he&#x2019;d go on to describe the creature as something vaguely reptilian, with a pair of horns, each a foot long, that curved off the back of its head, and a thick, kangaroo-like tail that reached all the way down to the floor. Beauregard marveled time and again at the smoke he recalled curling out of its pronounced snout. &#x201c;And the teeth&#x2014;sharp as little knifepoints. That&#x2019;s all I could see because a hockey mask covered the rest of its face!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As he drew his tale to a close, he&#x2019;d always take off his cap and, befuddled, scratch his furry head. &#x201c;But the <i>eyes</i>&#x2014;even with that mask I could see the green eyes, like little glowing peas floating in pitch-black oil.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Two things were certain about Beauregard: He always wore a plaid shirt, and he never joked around. So his words were received with interest and amazement. And soon there were others who said that they, too, had been accosted by a vaguely reptilian, green-eyed, blue-skinned creature in a brocade jacket. But the mask it wore to cover so terrifying a face was always different: the Lone Ranger, a sinister clown, an inscrutable King Tut, and so on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sensible folks thought that Beauregard may have been the victim of a prank played by a beanpole stagehand named Beaker. But when they asked the guileless ginger if it was true, he frantically proclaimed, &#x201c;Meep meep meep!&#x201d; in passionate denial.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then one after the other came a series of happenings so curious and so inexplicable that even the most skeptical Opera employees were reconsidering.<br> &nbsp;<br> For instance, few are braver than a firefighter, agreed? They fear nothing, especially not fire (<i>obvi!</i>). Well, the fireman in question was an intrepid, floppy-eared elephant named Seymour who could put out even the most raging conflagration with just one trunkful of water. The pachyderm had gone to make a round of code inspections in the cellars, a routine occurrence to ensure that the building&#x2019;s safety was up to snuff.<br> &nbsp;<br> It seems Seymour had descended to levels he normally didn&#x2019;t. A short while later, he reappeared on the stage, pale and trembling, and practically collapsed into the outstretched arms of Johnny Fiama&#x2019;s mother, Mama Fiama, a deeply dedicated usher at the theater.<br> &nbsp;<br> And why was Seymour so shaken? Because he had seen coming toward him, floating in the air, a head of fire without a body attached to it!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe it was Grosse,&#x201d; Pep� suggested at the time. &#x201c;He ees known for being a hothead, okay. <i>Hot</i> head . . . ? Anyone . . . ? No?&#x201d; Try as he might, Pep� couldn&#x2019;t lighten the ominous mood that permeated the Opera.<br> &nbsp;<br> The <i>corps de poulet</i> was thrown into consternation. This flaming head in no way matched Beauregard&#x2019;s description of the masked blue-skinned lizard freak. But the young chicks soon accepted the preposterous explanation that the ghost must have several heads that he could swap as he pleased.<br> &nbsp;<br> And let&#x2019;s face it, once a firefighter fainted, all the creatures of the Opera House had plenty of excuses for the creeping fright that made them quicken their pace when walking down a dark corridor or rounding some blind corner.<br> &nbsp;<br> You could find the fear even in the Opera&#x2019;s tough-cookie star singer, the powerhouse Yolanda Rat, a no-nonsense rodent who made up for her lack of height with oversize talent and a huge attitude. On the day after she helped revive Seymour alone in her dressing room for about three unforgettable hours (others may have found him chunky, but she found him hunky), she placed a horseshoe on the table by the stage door for everyone to touch before setting foot on the first tread of the staircase, a customary jinx fixer. <br> &nbsp;<br> But to return to the evening in question: Camilla had seen the ghost, and she was jittery in the extreme. An agonizing silence now reigned in Janice&#x2019;s dressing room. Nothing was heard but the hard breathing of the chickens and a robust burp from Pep�, who muttered in apology, &#x201c;Escuse me. The Swedish Chef&#x2019;s Stroganoff, she ees a real repeater, okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Johnny was about to offer Janice a shoulder rub when Camilla, flinging herself into the farthest corner of the room, eyes wide and beak chattering, whispered: &#x201c;<i>Bgark!</i>&#x201d; And everybody did indeed immediately shush just as the chick had implored. All eyes followed her terrified stare toward the closed dressing-room door.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the stillness they could hear a faint rustling outside. It was like heavy silk sliding over the door, perhaps the sleeve of an embroidered jacket making gentle contact with the wall&#x2019;s smooth wood . . . Then it stopped.<br> &nbsp;<br> Janice was determined to show more pluck than the birds. Fighting her fear, she went to the door and tried to sense an aura on the other side of the wood. But getting no vibes, she boldly reached out and turned the key.<br> &nbsp;<br> Johnny quickly stepped to her side. &#x201c;Whoa, you don&#x2019;t wanna go out there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Aplauso!</i>&#x201d; cheered Pep�, clapping with all his hands. &#x201c;Brave Johnny does the chivalry!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You got the wrong idea, sea bug. The <i>bird</i>&#x2019;s gonna go first.&#x201d; Camilla squawked as Johnny drew back the door and, overlooking her protests, nudged her out into the gloomy hallway, his pinkie rings glinting with reflected light from the bright dressing room behind them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beyond Camilla&#x2019;s quivering comb, the baritone saw that the passage seemed to be unoccupied. A gas lamp cast a suspicious light into the surrounding darkness but didn&#x2019;t succeed in dispelling it. All that could be heard were the incongruously upbeat strains of the singing duo Wayne and Wanda warbling a song far away onstage at the ongoing gala performance.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fair warning, weirdo,&#x201d; called Johnny to the unseen specter. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me throw this chicken at you!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But after a few moments of waiting, Johnny gave up and returned his petrified hostage back inside, closing the door behind them. &#x201c;There ain&#x2019;t no one there,&#x201d; he announced to the room. &#x201c;So here&#x2019;s the deal: I&#x2019;m gonna escort you down to the foyer, and then I by myself solo can bring Janice up here again after. You know, to protect her so she don&#x2019;t have to be alone&#x2014;capeesh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Camilla wasn&#x2019;t convinced. Still quaking, she whispered an appeal to Pep�, who shared her concerns with the group. &#x201c;She say she ees too afraid she might see him again, the blue demon Beauregard described, okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Beauregard?</i> Come on, Peps. That dude&#x2019;s three layers short of a lasagna,&#x201d; scoffed Johnny. &#x201c;I mean, he <i>clearly</i> forgot to pay his brain bill.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Janice bristled. &#x201c;Like, what makes you say that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One time I come across him frantically painting a scenery flat. I go, &#x2018;Why are you moving so fast?&#x2019; And that brainiac says, &#x2018;I wanna get the job done before I run out of paint.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, ees a fact Beauregard is not the brightest bulb on the shed, okay,&#x201d; agreed Pep�, &#x201c;but my assistant stage manager, Scooter? He say the story ees true.&#x201d; He told them how the day before, Scooter, alone in the office they shared...</p><h2>Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done</h2><p><b>"I well recall a conversation with an executive I hoped to interview about her astonishing productivity.

Time gives you choices.Choices, skillfully made, lead to freedom.<br><br>-Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English<br><br>Robert Kauffman has been a school principal for twenty-one years. During that time, he's discovered a truth about education and, really, any field involving good intentions and infinite demands. "I think people are often just overwhelmed," he says. Being a principal is an "ambiguous" job, which lends itself to "winging it." A new school leader will feel compelled to focus on the crises right in front of her. The trouble is that, at the end of a crisis-filled day, she'll realize she never did check in with that teacher who wanted advice on reteaching a math concept few pupils understood. The urgent crowds out the important. The important doesn't get done.<br><br>Thanks to his two decades of experience, Kauffman imagined he was more effective than average, but in 2016, when he became the principal of Hillside Elementary School in Farmington Hills, Michigan, he knew he would be challenged in new ways. The school had an outsized proportion of English-language learners. He wanted to find time to support his best teachers, and mentor those who needed help. He wanted to focus on improving student performance without getting derailed by every late bus and broken pipe.<br><br>So in late 2016, Kauffman signed on to the National SAM Innovation Project. This fascinating principal professional development program is centered on the belief that principal time is uniquely valuable. A teacher can influence the twenty-five students in his class. A principal can influence a whole school. But for principal time to be invested well, first the principal needs to know where his time goes. Then he can figure out options for redeploying time to the tasks that he does best. After that, he can do the hard work of following up daily to check that these lofty goals are reflected in the reality of how he spends his hours.<br><br>Kauffman, who calls himself a "data dork," was keen to get this information. After the principal did some initial work with SAM headquarters, a black-clad gentleman appeared at Hillside Elementary School to follow Kauffman around for a Monday-through-Friday school week. Like Kauffman's very own Boswell, the man recorded in five-minute increments absolutely everything Kauffman did. This included snacks and water breaks. He followed him into the lunchroom and into meetings. He made notes as Kauffman dealt with the plethora of discipline issues that of course cropped up during a week when teachers were conscious of creating a good impression. Kauffman had prepared the staff, though he notes that they were still deadly curious about the whole process. Some tried to engage the mysterious scribe in conversation, generally with no result (he was beholden to clean data!).<br><br>Soon thereafter, Kauffman received his stats. He learned that he was spending 39.2 percent of his time on "instructional leadership"-the teacher and curriculum management that tends to be the highest-value use of a principal's time. That's better than the average principal, who spends about 30 percent of her time on these matters, but less than Kauffman wanted. Time passes whether or not we think about how we spend it, and this is as true in an elementary school as it is anywhere else. Without active tending, Kauffman's time was easily taken over by the equivalent of weeds: dealing with paperwork that could be managed by other people, constantly answering email, and spending too much time supervising the cafeteria.<br><br>So, like a landscape designer surveying his plot, he sketched ideas of what he would like his time to look like. He brainstormed ways to be in the classrooms more often. He created "Teaching Tuesdays," during which he'd teach lessons to give teachers examples of techniques. Most worked, though some bombed, which was a learning experience for everyone. He designated times during which he would give teachers positive feedback. "I'm not a celebratory feedback guy," he confesses. "The joke is if I say it's okay, it means it's great," but lauding what goes right is curiously motivational.<br><br>With guidance from SAM headquarters, he aimed to build in thirty minutes a day for personal matters, such as making doctor appointments or calling contractors to get bids on home projects. Without dedicated time, these activities could bleed into the rest of the day and derail other goals. Or else they might not happen, creating work/life stress (more the case for Kauffman; his baseline was a mere 1.4 percent of time spent on anything remotely personal, including time in the bathroom). He also worked on not scheduling every minute. "You want to leave open space in your calendar," he says. That way, "whatever comes up comes up."<br><br>All this was exciting, but putting twenty minutes on the schedule to give a teacher celebratory feedback is only helpful if you then spend twenty minutes actually doing it. Things come up. Yet here's the reality of those interruptions and setbacks: If the fire alarm goes off during those scheduled twenty minutes, that doesn't change the fact that the feedback was a priority. Using time well means immediately rescheduling that feedback to a time that has been intentionally left open precisely because things like the fire alarm will happen.<br><br>During the six months after he tracked his time, Kauffman and an employee he designated to be his "school administration manager" (that's the "SAM" part of the program) checked in every day to see if his time was spent as it was supposed to be spent. If the previous day had gone off the rails, they tried to understand why. They analyzed what prevented Kauffman from spending time on the things only he could do. "I think the single greatest thing of SAM is that a principal is held accountable for his time," he says. His SAM kept nudging him to make time on his schedule to work with a teacher who really needed guidance. They had identified this as a priority, so it was given larger swaths of space than Kauffman might have naturally given it. His SAM urged him to stop doing things, such as lunchroom duty, that others could do. They figured out who could be a "first responder" if a parent called about an issue that didn't need to be escalated up the chain of command. "I was everywhere prior to SAM," Kauffman says. "But we can't be everywhere, nor should we be everywhere."<br><br>The result: a follow-up study at the end of the 2016-2017 school year found that Kauffman was spending 51 percent of his time on instructional leadership. That's like gaining an additional twelve days of high-impact work time during the one hundred days he spent on this calendar awareness. That time had impact as teachers responded to Kauffman's focus on their skills. The proportion of Hillside students demonstrating proficiency on state math tests rose by 4.2 percentage points that year, with similar gains in reading.<br><br>None of this is easy; constantly minding time is more challenging than letting it slip unnoticed into the past. It is also never done. Habits ("Teaching Tuesdays") help make good decisions automatic, yet there is never a moment when the time thing is figured out. Six veteran teachers might decide to leave, and a principal's time would then need to pivot to mentoring the new ones. The school day might change. School demographics might change. This is why the constant evaluation is necessary.<br><br>Yet this labor-this discipline-can lead to a surprising mental lightening. J. Thomas Roth, principal of Reddick Elementary School in Hillsborough County, Florida, has also tracked and monitored his time through the National SAM Innovation Project. He notes that this attention "has upgraded my life all the way around. I'm more effective at school," he says, having massively increased the time he spends on instructional leadership of the teachers serving Reddick's mostly low-income population. But "it's rare that I'm there past 4:30 p.m. anymore. I can leave for the day knowing what I've accomplished." Knowing that he has time on tomorrow's schedule to work with a teacher who's concerned about classroom discipline, Roth can relax when he's with his family. He can go to the gym. Asking daily where his time should go and then knowing where his time has gone, he knows for sure that "we really get a lot of stuff done here. It gives you that affirmation that you're doing good things."<br><br>Where the Time Really Goes<br><br>Everyone has an obsession. As you have probably guessed a few thousand words into this book, time and how we spend it-including how I spend it-is mine. Here's something I know: to write the introductory story to this chapter, I interviewed Kauffman on Friday, July 14, 2017, from 1:00 to 1:30 p.m. That was a day in which I slept in until 6:45 a.m., spent forty-five minutes dealing with some school paperwork, and devoted thirty minutes in the late afternoon to making sure there were no bills in my giant pile of mail. I interviewed Roth on Friday, July 21, at 9:30 a.m., shortly after devoting thirty minutes to practicing a speech I was giving to interns in Washington, D.C., the next week. That day also featured an afternoon phone call with my editor for this book-albeit about a different project-and a big-kids-only evening excursion from 6:15 to 8:30 p.m., inclusive of travel time, to Benihana.<br><br>I know these things not because I can remember all the stupid trivia of my life, but because, like Kauffman and Roth, I have tracked my time-in my case, continually, for several years. At first, I simply wanted to know where my time went. I assumed I could write about the numbers for my blog.<br><br>But as time went on, this experiment in mindfulness became so much more than that. The daily discipline of minding one's hours, I learned, changes the experience of time. It can lead to a savored life. As famed landscape architect Beatrix Farrand once said of a different sort of cultivation, "It is work-hard work, and at the same time it is perpetual pleasure."<br><br>Time, it turns out, is like Farrand's expertise: gardens-like the garden that I look at daily through my office window, watching the progression from daffodils in March to asters in the fall. Because it is my family's garden, I know the work of which Farrand speaks. I have watched my husband weed, water, and replace plants that pests kill. Any given weekend sees him pruning the rosebushes or planting mums. He likes the work-well, except for that one time when a chain saw tree-trimming accident sent him to the ER-which is why he has never farmed it out. The gardener just has to accept that gardening is not a set-it-and-forget-it activity. You assess, you tweak. You learn that even the hardiest plants have vulnerabilities. In early 2017, a few warm February days sent the buds on our magnolia tree into production. Then a March blizzard thwarted this growth, and those gorgeous cotton candy blossoms never opened. But this vigilance, and the setbacks, can be balanced with moments of enjoyment too. Indeed, it is the vigilance that leads to summer evenings when I sit on the back porch, look out at the crepe myrtles, and think Wow.<br><br>Likewise, with time, it is the same process. A gardener must know his plot. He must think about what he wants it to look like. Then it is the daily cultivation that leads to beauty, in a landscape and a life too. As the Buddhist monk and meditation teacher Bhante Henepola Gunaratana writes in his book Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English, "Mindfulness gives you time. Time gives you choices. Choices, skillfully made, lead to freedom." Knowing where my time goes, and choosing to tend my schedule as one might tend a garden, has changed my life, just as the same process has changed life for teachers and students at the Hillside and Reddick schools. It has made me feel like I have more time, like my schedule is surprisingly open. I believe it will make your life feel lighter too.<br><br>This chapter is about how to achieve such freedom. It is about how to attain the sort of skilled and blossoming mindfulness that lets you go off the clock.<br><br>My 8,784 Hours<br><br>But to my story-the tale of how I created a record of my July principal interviews and that Benihana trip. A confluence of events led to my decision, in April 2015, to become my own Boswell, recording my time in half-hour chunks. I had had hundreds of people track their time for me for various projects over the years, and I had tracked my own time for a dozen weeks here and there. As a born skeptic, I had long been fascinated by what these logs showed about the blind spots people have about time. There can be great gaps between how we think we spend our time and reality as recorded. People claim to have no leisure time and then can recount in detail what happened on the most recent Big Bang Theory. Or-I was guilty of this one-we feel like we spend hours unloading the dishwasher, only to learn it takes five minutes each time, the four times per week we do it.<br><br>I didn't think I'd have many glaring blind spots, but I was curious about my time. I had fallen off the wagon of keeping a journal, and I suspected, that April, that I was about to live through a watershed few years of my life. In mid-May 2014, shortly before Jasper's seventh birthday, I had woken one morning to an unexpected but familiar wave of nausea. A pregnancy test and a doctor visit confirmed that my fourth child was on his way.<br><br>Alex was born in January 2015. Going from three children to four is less shocking than going from zero to one, but newborns are always challenging, and caring for a newborn along with a seven-year-old, five-year-old, and three-year-old was going to test my organizational skills. Around the same time, my work life was taking some exciting turns. I Know How She Does It, my book on how professional women make the most of their time, was going to be published in June 2015. My speaking calendar for the next year was filling up. As I spoke to audiences about how people made their lives work, I wanted to see in as factual a way as possible how I did it.<br><br>So, fully back at work three months after the birth of my fourth child, I opened a new spreadsheet on Monday, April 20, 2015. I started filling in the cells, which ran from 5:00 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. on the vertical axis, with the days of the week across the top. There wasn't a big gap before the first waking entry. I was up at 5:30 a.m. to nurse Alex, something I would do five times that day, with a sixth feeding coming from a pumped bottle. I took Jasper to the bus stop. I had a conference call with the publicity team at my publisher. I sat outside enjoying the spring blossoms while the baby napped in the evening. I made it into bed around 10:00 p.m. The next day, I chaperoned Sam's field trip to a local museum, then I took the train to New York City for some professional events. I made it home at 10:30 p.m., and chatted with my husband before pumping and going to bed at 11:30 p.m., to rise at 5:45 a.m. the next day and start again.</p><h2>A Guide to Jewish Prayer</h2><p>For both the novice and for those who have been engaged in prayer for years, here is the one guide needed to practice Jewish prayer and understand the prayer book, from one of the world's most famous and respected rabbis.<br><br>From the origins and meaning of worship to a step-by-step explanation of the daily prayers to the reason you're not supposed to chat with your friends during services, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz answers many of the questions likely to arise about Jewish prayer. Here are chapters on daily prayer; Sabbath prayer; prayer services for the holidays; the yearly cycle of synagogue&nbsp;Bible readings; the history and makeup of the synagogue; the different prayer rites for Ashkenazim, Sephardim, Yemenites, and other cultural/geographic groupings; the role of the rabbi and the cantor in the synagogue; and the role of music in the service.</p><p>For readers who wish to learn about Jewish prayer, <i>A Guide to Jewish Prayer</i> is the first book to read, and the one that will be the cornerstone of any collection of books on the subject. Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a world- renowned scholar of Judaic studies and the editor and translator of Random House's 22-volume edition of the Talmud, has written this <i>Guide</i> in order to "open the gates of Jewish prayer for those who want to know and comprehend both its essence and its structure, and the numerous details concerning the various prayer services." Beginning with magisterial essays on the nature of prayer and the history of the Siddur (the common Jewish prayer book), Steinsaltz then moves to a detailed description of the prayer services conducted over the course of the Jewish year, and ends with a series of essays about communal prayer, including chapters on the synagogue, prayer accessories, and the music of prayer. With a comprehensive glossary and short biographies of the many rabbis who have influenced the history of Jewish prayer, Steinsaltz's <i>Guide</i> provides every necessary resource for understanding prayer, for every conceivable reader--from the curious gentile to the devoted Jew. <i>-- Michael Joseph Gross</i>No book is closer to the heart of the Jew than the Siddur; none has had such a profound influence [or been] so uniquely able to penetrate to the very depths of the soul.<br><br>For generations, the Siddur was the first book the Jewish child learned to read, and through the struggle to grasp the combinations of letters, he repeated and learned to recite its phrases by heart. This bond with the prayer book engendered a great intimacy between the Jew and the Siddur in both the emotional and intellectual spheres. But the bond is not only a primary, intimate one; it is an ongoing, lifelong process. While other books are used only as study texts which, once mastered, need not be read again, or are reread only after a long period, the Siddur accompanies the Jew throughout life. . . .<br><br>No other Jewish book contains the entirety of Judaism. The Siddur is like a garland, intertwining all the strands of Judaism and encompassing all fields of Jewish creativity in all their variegated forms. It includes sections that reflect the fundamentals of Jewish faith, and those relating to the field of religious law. . . . [It] contains sections of exalted poetry, and matters of ritual procedure. There are prayers that deal with the most intimate details of individual needs and problems, supplications reflecting the sorrows and aspirations of the nation, and prayers that touch upon the entire cosmos.<br>--From <b>A Guide to Jewish Prayer</b></p><h2>Mrs. Kimble</h2><p>&#x201c;Beautiful, devastating and complex.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>Chicago Tribune</em><br><br>The award-winning debut novel from Jennifer Haigh, author of <em>BakerTowers</em>, <em>The Condition</em>, and <em>Faith</em>, tells the story of Birdie, Joan,and Dinah, three women who marry the same charismatic, predatory, and enigmaticopportunist: Ken Kimble. Resonating with emotional intensity and narrativeinnovation reminiscent of Ann Patchett&#x2019;s <em>Bel</em><em> Canto</em>, Barbara Kingsolver&#x2019;s <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em>, and Zora Neale Hurston&#x2019;s <em>TheirEyes Were Watching God</em>, Haigh&#x2019;s <em>Mrs. Kimble </em>is a timeless story ofgrief, passion, heartache, deception, and the complex riddle of love.</p><p>Sometimes a book can be utterly full of holes and you still can't put it down. In <i>Mrs. Kimble</i>, first-time novelist Jennifer Haigh follows the marital career of Ken Kimble, opportunist, serial husband, and all around schmuck. The first section, set in Virginia in the 1960s, revolves around alcoholic first wife Birdie. As we enter the story, Kimble has already left her alone with two small children she is ill equipped to raise on her own. Kimble's absence in this section sets the tone for the book, which is not so much about Kimble himself as it is about the women he dupes over the years. Next up is Joan, a <i>Newsweek</i> reporter recovering from a mastectomy at her late father's home in Florida. A wealthy, confident woman left unsteady by breast cancer, she falls for Kimble, who now turns up in a hippie-ish incarnation. In the final section, Kimble weds Dinah, who had been his children's babysitter back in Virginia. Their marriage unravels as, at the end of the book, Kimble's secrets are revealed one by one. Unfortunately, the central secret of the book is never laid bare: how did the man get to be such a jerk? Other problems are never dealt with, either: we never believe a whip-smart woman like Joan could be so transparently snow-jobbed. We never understand why Dinah stays with an aging crook. Nevertheless, <i>Mrs. Kimble</i> is still engrossing. Haigh is so gifted at creating vivid scenes and strong characters, we find ourselves surrendering our disbelief despite our better judgment. This isn't the terrific book it might have been, but it's still a superior read. <i>--Claire Dederer</i><p>A chameleon, an enigma, all things to all women -- a lifeline to which powerful needs and nameless longings may be attached -- Ken Kimble is revealed through the eyes of the women he seduces: Birdie, his first wife, struggling to hold herself together after his desertion; second wife, Joan, a lonely, tragic heiress who sees her unknowable husband as her last chance for happiness; and Dinah, a beautiful but damaged woman half his age.</p></p><h2>A Mouse Called Julian</h2><p><b>Rising star Joe Todd-Stanton brings his unique, modern illustration style to an inversion of the classic Aesop Fable of <i>The Lion and the Mouse</i>, as Julian the Mouse learns that sometimes, having a friend over for dinner can be just the right amount of variety in your day.</b><br><br>When the fox tries to sneak into Julian's burrow for a tasty bite of mouse, it finds itself stuck headfirst in Julian's front door!

It's about how to do equipment or product changeovers in record time--often in less than 10 minutes. The method you'll learn here is called SMED, short for "Single-Minute Exchange of Die" (the "single" here means a single-digit number of minutes). <p>Developed from a longer book, <i>A Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System</i> (cat no. PP9903), written for managers, this book is written for frontline production and assembly associates. It presents an overview of the reasons why SMED is important for companies and employees, sets out the three basic stages of SMED, and then devotes a separate chapter to each of these stages. The first chapter of the book is like an "owner's manual" that tells you how to get the most out of your reading time by using the margin assists, summaries, and other features of the book to help pull out exactly what you need. </p><p>One of the most effective ways to use this book is to read and discuss it with other employees. The authors planned the book so that it can be used this way, &nbsp;organizing the book into chunks of information that can be covered in a series of short sessions. Each chapter includes reflection questions to stimulate group discussion. A <i>Learning Package </i>is also available (catalog no.PP7126), which includes a leader's guide, overhead transparencies to summarize major points, and color slides showing examples of SMED applications in different kinds of companies. </p><p></p></p><p>Changeover is the process of setting up a production line for a different process or product. Many plants take hours or even days to do a changeover - a major barrier to manufacturing flexibility. Quick Changeover for Operators, based on Shigeo Shingo&#39;s SMED system, teaches frontline employees the techniques and approaches that turn hours of changeover time into minutes, even seconds! Now the learning format in the Shopfloor Series makes these powerful techniques accessible to the whole workforce. SMED is short for &#34;Single-Minute Exchange of Die&#34;. The &#34;single&#34; here means a single-digit number of minutes - less than ten. The SMED approach is simple and universal. It works in companies all over the world. Although it was first used in (and named for) manufacturing with dies, the basic principles of SMED have been used to reduce setup and turnaround time in all types of manufacturing, assembly, and even service industries, from process and packaging plants to airlines.</p><h2>Effective Crisis Communication: Moving From Crisis to Opportunity</h2><p><p>In this fully updated <strong>Fourth Edition </strong>of <strong>Effective Crisis Communication</strong>, three of today&#x2019;s most respected crisis/risk communication scholars provide the latest theories and innovative approaches for handling crisis. Unlike other crisis communication texts, this acclaimed book answers the question, "what now?" and explains how organizations can create the potential for opportunity, renewal, and growth through effective crisis communication.

Unfortunately, their decisions are rarely informed by evidence on the consequences of these initiatives in other settings. Nor are decisions typically accompanied by well-formulated plans to evaluate their causal impacts. As a result, knowledge about what works in different situations has been very slow to accumulate. <br><br>Over the last several decades, advances in research methodology, administrative record keeping, and statistical software have dramatically increased the potential for researchers to conduct compelling evaluations of the causal impacts of educational interventions, and the number of well-designed studies is growing. Written in clear, concise prose, <em>Methods Matter: Improving Causal Inference in Educational and Social Science Research</em> offers essential guidance for those who evaluate educational policies. Using numerous examples of high-quality studies that have evaluated the causal impacts of important educational interventions, the authors go beyond the simple presentation of new analytical methods to discuss the controversies surrounding each study, and provide heuristic explanations that are also broadly accessible. Murnane and Willett offer strong methodological insights on causal inference, while also examining the consequences of a wide variety of educational policies implemented in the U.S. and abroad. Representing a unique contribution to the literature surrounding educational research, this landmark text will be invaluable for students and researchers in education and public policy, as well as those interested in social science.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard J. Murnane</strong>, Juliana W. and William Foss Thompson Professor of Education and Society at Harvard University, is an economist who focuses his research on the relationships between education and the economy, teacher labor markets, the determinants of children's achievement, and strategies for making schools more effective. <br><br><strong>John B. Willett</strong>, Charles William Eliot Professor of Education at Harvard University, is a quantitative methodologist who has devoted his career to improving the research design and data-analytic methods used in education and the social sciences, with a particular emphasis on the design of longitudinal research and the analysis of longitudinal data .<br><br>"Policy discussions today routinely demand that proposals be evidence-based -- without really understanding that the reliability and validity of what passes as evidence varies widely. Murnane and Willett have done a remarkable job of helping both producers and consumers to understand what is good evidence and how it can be produced. Methods Matter explains lucidly how the causal impact of educational and social interventions can be estimated from quantitative data, using a panoply of innovative empirical approaches." --Eric A. Hanushek, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University <br><p></p><br>"<em>Methods Matter</em> is about research designs and statistical analyses for drawing valid and reliable causal inferences from data about real-world problems. The book's most telling feature is the wide range of education research examples that it uses to illustrate each point made. By presenting powerful research methods in the context of important research questions the authors are able to draw readers quickly and deeply into the material covered. New and experienced researchers from many fields will learn a lot from reading <em>Methods Matter</em> and will enjoy doing so."--Howard S. Bloom, Chief Social Scientist, MDRC <br><p></p><br>"Richard J. Murnane and John B. Willett provide a broadly accessible account of causal inference in educational research. They consider basic principles- how to define causal effects, frame causal questions, and design experiments- while also gently introducing important topics that have previously been obscure to non-specialists: randomization by group, natural experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and propensity scores. Using a wide range or examples, the authors teach their readers to identify and challenge key assumptions underlying claims about what works in education. This book will improve educational research by challenging researchers and policy-makers to think more rigorously about the evidence and assumptions underlying their work." -- Stephen W. Raudenbush, Lewis Sebring Distinguished Service Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Chicago <br><p></p><br>"I strongly recommend Methods Matter to anyone who intends to conduct research on the causal impact of education programs and policies. Henceforth, a graduate course in education research methods that doesn't rely on it should be considered suspect. Methods Matter should also be essential reading for those who want to be critical consumers of advanced education research. <em>Methods Matter</em> very much, and so does this book. It is a very good book that signals a coming of age of the field." <br>--Grover Whitehurst, Director, Brown Center on Education Policy, Brookings Institute <br><p></p><br>"To be useful for development policy, educational research has to shed more light on how resources for education can produce more learning, more knowledge, more skills. In this book, Professors Richard Murnane and John Willett discuss a range of empirical methods for estimating causal relationships and review their applications in educational research. They translate complex statistical concepts into clear, accessible language and provide the kind of analytical guidance that a graduate student or young researcher might obtain only after years of experience with these methods. This volume is a very readable companion to any statistics textbook or statistical program on evaluation methods." <br>--Elizabeth M.

Ambrose's highly regarded history of the United States Military Academy features the original foreword by Dwight D. Eisenhower and a new afterword by former West Point superintendent Andrew J. Goodpaster.</p></p><p><i>Duty, Honor, Country</i>: the motto of the United States Military Academy has resounded for more than 200 years. Stephen Ambrose charts the history of West Point from its origins in the Revolutionary War--when students attached to engineering and artillery regiments studied the rudiments of strategy, but mostly came and went as they pleased--to the academy's time of crisis during the Vietnam War. Ambrose's narrative centers on West Point's superintendents, the Army officers who emphasized both tradition and innovation over the years--men such as Sylvanus Thayer, who commanded from 1817 to 1833 and who introduced customs that are still observed today; and Douglas MacArthur, who joined personal flamboyance with a deep-seated commitment to martial, academic, and athletic excellence. (Among MacArthur's other contributions was his codification of the "honor system," a set of self-policing regulations that distinguishes West Point from any other nation's military colleges.) Ambrose does not gloss over the academy's less exalted moments, especially the frictions brought on by the Civil War, when many Northerners accused West Point as a whole of being proslavery. Writing in an afterword that brings the history of the academy to the present, former superintendent Andrew Goodpaster confronts such matters as the honor code scandal of 1976 and the cultural changes brought on by the admission of women to the academy in the same year. Yet this book is a fitting celebration of an institution that has been of central importance to the American military. Originally published in 1966, at the start of his career, <i>Duty, Honor, Country</i> shows Stephen Ambrose's skills as researcher and popularizer, skills that he would go on to develop in such later books as <i>Undaunted Courage</i> and <i>Citizen Soldiers</i>. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p>A New York Times bestselling author writes about West Point.</p></p><h2>The SHIIT Workout: Get Fit While You Sh*t</h2><p><p>Getting into shape has never been more fun, as you go through the (bowel) motions from jumping jacksies and push-outs to bottom burpees and sliders.

But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all our inventions -- our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations -- we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society. <br>In <i>Blueprint</i>, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide. <br>With many vivid examples -- including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own -- Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness. <br>In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it's tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, <i>Blueprint </i>shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies have shaped, and are still shaping, our genes today.</p><p><b>Nicholas A. Christakis</b> is a physician and sociologist who explores the ancient origins and modern implications of human nature. He directs the Human Nature Lab at Yale University, where he is the Sterling Professor of Social and Natural Science, in the Departments of Sociology, Medicine, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Statistics and Data Science, and Biomedical Engineering. He is the Co-Director of the Yale Institute for Network Science and the co-author of <i>Connected</i>."Mr. Christakis's deep optimism (and considerable evidence) about the arc of human society bending towards good is uplifting. Along the way he delves fascinatingly into human cultures and customs, exploring, for instance, why monogamy and marriage have become so common (though not universal), and what friendship really means, from an evolutionary perspective."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Economist</i></i></b><br><br>"A dazzlingly erudite synthesis of history, philosophy, anthropology, genetics, sociology, economics, epidemiology, statistics and more. It uses everything from shipwrecks to the primatologist Jane Goodall to make its pro-kindness case, and it inadvertently shames you into realizing that while most of us, standing at the buffet of knowledge, content ourselves with a pork chop and rice pudding, Christakis pillages the carving station and the omelet station and the soup array and the make-your-own-sundae bar."&#x2015;<b><i>Frank Bruni, New York Times</i></b><br><br>"An encouraging, detailed and persuasive antidote to misanthropy"&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Wall Street Journal<br></i></i></b><br><br>"The diversity of our cultures and personal identities masks the fact that we are one. In this brilliant, beautiful, and sweeping book, Christakis shows how eight universal human tendencies have bound us together, and given us dominion over our planet, our lives, and our common fate. A masterful achievement that is surely the best and most original science book of the year."&#x2015;<b><i>Daniel Gilbert, author of<i> Stumbling on Happiness</i></i></b><br><br>"Nicholas Christakis is a pioneer in bridging the conceptual chasm between the choices of individual people and the shaping of an entire society. In this timely and fascinating book, he shows how the better angels of our nature, rooted in our evolutionary past, can bring forth an enlightened and compassionate civilization."&#x2015;<b><i>Steven Pinker, author of <i>Enlightenment Now </i></i></b><br><br>"In a book of great wisdom and unusual breadth, Christakis pulls together philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, genetics, and evolutionary biology to make an extraordinarily optimistic argument: evolution has pre-wired us for goodness. At a moment when the dark history of the early twentieth century suddenly seems relevant again, it's a relief to be reminded of why so many efforts to re-engineer human society have failed -- and of why the better side of human nature often triumphs in the end."&#x2015;<b><i>Anne Applebaum, author of the Pulitzer prize-winning <i>Gulag: A History</i></i></b><br><br>"In this wisely optimistic book, Christakis explores the evolutionary imperative of forming bonds that are both cultural and genetic. His writing is colorful, personal, and often exuberant."&#x2015;<b><i>Andrew Solomon, author of <i>Far from the Tree</i></i></b><br><br>"Christakis brings to general readers his most famous theory: the genetic profile of both humans and animals dictates the types of societies that they create. Using a plethora of accessible examples that range from the social behavior of dolphins and chimpanzees to the tenets that link human behavior in a myriad of settings, from reality shows to arranged marriages, along with a generous look into the author's own past, Christakis reminds us that leadership, friendship, and group tendencies are all rooted in the most fundamental mechanism of our biological sorting: natural selection. A must-read for anyone interested in how we find ourselves wholly divided into political, religious, and workplace silos, and where these separations may lead us."&#x2015;<b><i>Hope Jahren, author of <i>Lab Girl</i></i></b><br><br>"A remarkable achievement! Christakis explains, in the most lucid and accessible way imaginable, how our genetic and cultural heritages are deeply intertwined. The story of human nature is no fairy tale, but it nevertheless reveals our potential, and our proclivity, for good."&#x2015;<b><i>Angela Duckworth, author of <i>Grit</i></i></b><br><br>"In this brilliant and humane book, Christakis defends an optimistic view of humanity. Human nature is not solitary and brutish -- we are social beings, capable of intimate ties and great kindness, blessed with extraordinary potential. <i>Blueprint</i> is clear, persuasive, and vitally important."&#x2015;<b><i>Paul Bloom, author of <i>Against Empathy</i></i></b></p><h2>Junia: The First Woman Apostle</h2><p>The name &#34;Junia&#34; appears in Romans 16:7, and Paul identifies her (along with Andronicus) as &#34;prominent among the apostles.&#34; In this important work, Epp investigates the mysterious disappearance of Junia from the traditions of the church. Because later theologians and scribes could not believe (or wanted to suppress) that Paul had numbered a woman among the earliest churches&#39; apostles, Junia&#39;s name was changed in Romans to a masculine form. Despite the fact that the earliest churches met in homes and that other women were clearly leaders in the churches (e.g., Prisca and Lydia), calling Junia an apostle seemed too much for the tradition. Epp tracks how this happened in New Testament manuscripts, scribal traditions, and translations of the Bible. In this thoroughgoing study, Epp restores Junia to her rightful place.</p><p>Eldon Jay Epp is Harkness Professor of Biblical Literature emeritus and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences emeritus at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio).</p><h2>Sita</h2><p>It is significant that the only character in Hindu mythology, a king at that, to be given the title of ekam-patni-vrata, devoted to a single wife, is associated with the most unjust act of abandoning her in the forest to protect family reputation. This seems a deliberate souring of an uplifting narrative. Ram's refusal to remarry to produce a royal heir adds to the complexity. The intention seems to be to provoke throught on notions of fidelity, property and self-image.<br><br>And so the mythologist and illustrator Devdutt Pattaanik retells the <i>Ramayana</i>, drawing attention to the many oral, visual and written retellings composed in different times, in different places, by different poets, each one trying to solve the puzzle in its own unique way.<br><br>This book approaches Ram by speculating on Sita: her childhood with her father, Janaka, who hosted sages mentioned in the Upanishads; her stay in the forest with her husband, who had to be a celibate ascetic while she was in the prime of her youth; her interactions with the women of Lanka, recipes she exchanged, emotions they shared; her connection with the earth, her mother, and with the trees, her sisters; her role as the Goddess, the untamed Kali as well as the demure Gauri, in transforming the stoic prince of Ayodhya into God.</p><p>Devdutt Pattanaik is a medical doctor by education, a leadership consultant by profession and a mythologist by passion. He has written and lectured extensively on the nature of sacred stories, symbols and rituals and their relevance in modern times. His books with Penguin India include <i>The Book of Ram, Myth = Mithya: A Handbook of Hindu Mythology, The Pregnant King, The Book of Kali, Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharata, </i>and the <i>Devlok </i>series of stories for children.

"Things you hardly noticed before took on enormous significance: a comfortable, solid armchair, the soothing look of a white-tiled stove," writes Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist for Polish radio when the Germans invaded. His mother's insistence on laying the table with clean linen for their midday meal, even as conditions for Jews worsened daily, makes palpable the Holocaust's abstract horror. Arbitrarily removed from the transport that took his family to certain death, Szpilman does not deny the "animal fear" that led him to seize this chance for escape, nor does he cheapen his emotions by belaboring them. Yet his cool prose contains plenty of biting rage, mostly buried in scathing asides (a Jewish doctor spared consignment to "the most wonderful of all gas chambers," for example). Szpilman found compassion in unlikely people, including a German officer who brought food and warm clothing to his hiding place during the war's last days. Extracts from the officer's wartime diary (added to this new edition), with their expressions of outrage at his fellow soldiers' behavior, remind us to be wary of general condemnation of any group. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[Szpilman's] account is hair-raising beyond anything Hollywood could invent...an altogether unforgettable book." -- <i>THE DAILY TELEGRAPH </i><p> "[Szpilman's] shock and ensuing numbness become ours, so that acts of ordinary kindness or humanity take on an aura of miracle. --<i>THE OBSERVER </i></p><p> "Rarely has the sheer claustrophobia of living in the Warsaw Ghetto been so vividly conveyed as it is by Szpilman." --<i>THE INDEPENDENT </i></p></p><h2>Geography of You and Me</h2><p>Lucy lives on the twenty-fourth floor. Owen lives in the basement. It's fitting, then, that they meet in the middle -- stuck between two floors of a New York City apartment building, on an elevator rendered useless by a citywide blackout. After they're rescued, Lucy and Owen spend the night wandering the darkened streets and marveling at the rare appearance of stars above Manhattan. But once the power is back, so is reality. Lucy soon moves abroad with her parents, while Owen heads out west with his father.<br><br>The brief time they spend together leaves a mark. And as their lives take them to Edinburgh and to San Francisco, to Prague and to Portland, Lucy and Owen stay in touch through postcards, occasional e-mails, and phone calls.

Here is Welles&#x2019;s prodigious childhood; his youth in New York, with its fraught partnership with John Houseman and the groundbreaking triumph of his all-black <i>Macbeth;</i> the pioneering radio work that culminated in the notorious 1938 broadcast of <i>War of the Worlds</i>; and finally, his work in Hollywood, including an authoritative account of the making of <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Rich in detail and insight, this is far and away the definitive look at Orson Welles&#x2014;a figure even more extraordinary than the myths that have surrounded him.</p><p>Now in paperback, Callow's vastly entertaining chronicle of Welles's first 26 years seems even finer than it did in 1995. The author's ability to skewer his subject's evasions and lies while retaining critical affection for him is perhaps explained by the fact that Callow, an actor himself, understands the need to mythologize. Welles's innovative theatrical work in the 1930s has never been better described or analyzed. Even such oft-told sagas as the <i>War of the Worlds</i> broadcast and the filming of <i>Citizen Kane</i> gain new dimension from Callow's intelligent treatment.Simon Callow is an actor, director, and writer. He has appeared on the stage and in many films, including <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>. His other books include <i>Orson Welles: Hello Americans</i>, <i>Orson Welles: One-Man Band,</i>&nbsp;<i>Shooting the Actor</i>, and <i>Being an Actor</i>.</p><h2>Practical Lean Six Sigma for Healthcare - Using the A3 and Lean Thinking to Improve Operational Performance in Hospitals, Clinics, and Physician Group Practices</h2><p>This book bridges the gap between a highly quantitative analysis of a process that requires extensive training (i.e., Six Sigma certification) and a more simplified approach that can be used and understood by the masses (i.e., Lean thinking). We introduce the familiar healthcare protocol for patient care and safety, the Assess, Diagnosis, Treat, and Prevent (ADTP) model to be considered as an improvement methodology. This will assist those in your facility to better understand how Lean and Six Sigma can be successfully deployed. (NOTE: Please see The Practical Lean Six Sigma Pocket Guide for Healthcare (smaller, 3.5 in. x 5.5 in.) for the same tools, concepts, etc. arranged in the D-M-A-I-C model for less than 10 dollars!) The goal of this book is to make the methods and tools of Lean and Six Sigma accessible to more people and provide a common sense or practical approach to problem solving and continuous improvement. This book is intended to be used by Sigma Belt Levels, Lean Senseis (i.e., teachers), Continuous Improvement Specialists, front-line managers, and supervisors of departments and work groups, and improvement team members in their efforts to improve the patient care experience while reducing waste and variation in all types of healthcare processes. The Lean Six Sigma tools and concepts are presented relative to the A3 road map to provide a definitive how-to guide to problem solving and continuous improvement (Kaizen) initiatives. <p> The examples contained in this book are from a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physician group practices, and will assist team members to fully understand the tool s usage and purpose.</p><p> Throughout this book, the different improvement methodologies that organizations may already be using to meet the Joint Commission requirements are recognized and mentioned. We acknowledge that all have their benefits. It is important to select the one that fits the organization and will be widely used. The methodology should be easy to understand and follow, therefore better engaging the employees, as well as providing a visual management structure for reporting and sustaining continuous improvement initiatives. </p><p> The examples provided throughout this publication demonstrate how a Lean or Six Sigma tool was used in a particular setting. We have presented them in this manner to provide a general understanding on how the tools can be applied in everyday (i.e., practical) healthcare services. This includes supporting key parts of the Affordable Care Act (such as EMR deployment and meaningful use) and the IHI Triple Aim initiative.</p><p> Practical Lean Six Sigma for Healthcare is designed as a convenient, quick reference, and, most importantly, a step-by-step implementation guide. You can put your finger on any tool within a matter of seconds! Use the book as follows: Navigate the A3 Report as you progress through the project (starting at the top left of the report moving vertically to the bottom right). Complete the A3 Report as you learn and apply the tools on the project by: 1. Go to the tab in the book that corresponds to the A3 Report section you are working on. 2. Read about the tools for that stage of your project. 3. Apply the appropriate tools. 4. Complete the relevant section of the A3. 5. Repeat 1 - 4 as you navigate through the A3 and complete your project. Use the Case Study Example Look-Ahead to direct you to specific pages relative to hospitals, clinics, and/or physician group practices. Use the Index for quick access to a specific topic or tool. We expect with the knowledge conveyed in this book, as well as the experiences from your improvement projects, that one day you will become a Lean Sensei.</p></p><p>Todd Sperl is an enthusiastic, creative speaker and process improvement expert who looks beyond today s problems to find tomorrow s solutions.

She was born and raised in Albany, Georgia. She later moved to Savannah, where she started The Bag Lady catering company. The business took off and evolved into The Lady &amp; Sons restaurant, which is located in Savannah&#x2019;s historic district and specializes in Southern cooking. She also co-owns Uncle Bubba&#x2019;s Oyster House with her brother. Paula publishes a bimonthly magazine, <i>Cooking with Paula Deen, </i>and is a regular guest on QVC, where she sells her books and food products.<b> <b> <i>Introduction</i> </b> <br> </b> <br> <br>I have always believed that a big family was the greatest gift that anyone could have. When I was a little girl I would just beg and plead with my mama and daddy because I wished for more sisters and brothers. You may know that my wish didn&#x2019;t come true back then&#x2014;I lost both my parents when I was barely grown, and was left to finish raising my brother, Bubba. Now I thank my lucky stars to be blessed with a family that just keeps on growing. And when I talk about family, I&#x2019;m thinking about all the people who are most precious to me, whether or not we&#x2019;re actually related.<br> <br>I have the privilege of working with people so special to me that they&#x2019;ve become part of what I consider my extended family. So not only have I got my darling husband, Michael, wonderful sons and grandson, and beloved brother, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, and children by marriage, I&#x2019;ve also got my assistants, my publicist, and my dear agent, Barry, who makes me feel like I have a daddy again. All these people have become so important to me that I can&#x2019;t imagine they won&#x2019;t be a part of my life forever. One thing that&#x2019;s become clearer and clearer over the years: Family is not about being blood-related, it&#x2019;s simply about love.<br> <br>And food! Many of the bonds my family has were forged over the dinner table and through the sharing of recipes. Cooking is the way we express our love for one another. We celebrate just about everything that happens to us down here with a meal. It&#x2019;s a grand old Southern tradition! I remember as a young girl going to family reunions, and, oh my gosh, everybody would just try to outdo each other with their best dishes. It always felt like the good eating was lined up for blocks on those tables. To this day, bringing my family together means piling up a plate loaded with everybody&#x2019;s favorite recipes.<br> <br>Those family recipes are the very soul of everything I do. On my restaurant menu, you&#x2019;ll find my Grandmama Paul&#x2019;s fried chicken and collard greens; you&#x2019;ll find Aunt Peggy&#x2019;s meat loaf and her sweet potato souffl�. And if you&#x2019;ve ever sent one of your family recipes to me or my Web site, it might just end up on TV, where I love to share all the tasty tricks I learn from the people around me and beyond. My life is my cooking, and none of it would be possible without my family, and yours, too.<br> <br>Of course, I could never have started my restaurant without my aunts, uncles, cousins, and, most of all, my wonderful sons. Everyone really came together and pitched in from the very beginning, and they&#x2019;ve been there for me ever since. My Aunt Peggy and Uncle George made my dream of owning a beautiful restaurant come true when I didn&#x2019;t think I would be financially able to finish what I&#x2019;d set out to create. My little brother, Bubba, helped handle business matters at The Lady &amp; Sons before opening Uncle Bubba&#x2019;s Oyster House.<br> <br>Then there are Jamie and Bobby, who have been behind me all along. My boys were barely out of their teens when they started delivering lunches for The Bag Lady. And when we got our own restaurant, Jamie went right to work in the kitchen, and Bobby&#x2019;s smile was out front, making guests feel welcome in the dining room. The smartest thing I ever did was add &#x201c;&amp; Sons&#x201d; to the name of the restaurant. I wanted so badly to give those boys wings, to see that they had security and a future, and I feel I have done my best. I think so many of the people who eat at The Lady &amp; Sons pick up on the love that&#x2019;s at the heart of our restaurant.<br> <br>I try to thank my beautiful family and acknowledge them every chance I have, but even if I do this every day for the rest of my life, it will never be enough. That&#x2019;s why I decided that it was time to go ahead and dedicate a book to them. I just have to share with y&#x2019;all the love and good times I have with my family. Not to mention all the stories&#x2014;like the time Cousin George got behind the wheel of the family car at age eleven, or how Brooke went from being &#x201c;the five o&#x2019;clock girl&#x201d; to being Jamie&#x2019;s beautiful bride and mama to my grandson, baby Jack. I feel so lucky and blessed by the strong support and wonderful memories&#x2014;and the incredible recipes&#x2014;that my family has brought me. They are the heart and soul of this book.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m proud to share the recipes that I grew up on, like Aunt Peggy&#x2019;s Old-Fashioned Meat Loaf and Our Favorite Hearty Oxtail Stew. And I just can&#x2019;t keep to myself all the new ones that marriage has brought to our family table, like Michael&#x2019;s Deluxe Twice-Baked Potatoes with Shrimp and Michelle&#x2019;s Banana-Chocolate Gorilla Bread. Although I may be the one you&#x2019;ve seen cooking on TV, there&#x2019;s a whole family of great cooks behind every dish I make.<br> <br>As you look through these pages, you&#x2019;ll recognize some old-time down-home favorites as well as some more health-minded dishes. Those tend to be the ones that Michael and I enjoy a little more often these days to balance out all the pound cake and fried chicken! Eating a more moderate diet is something we all have to think about, especially as we get older. Making it all still taste delicious is a must for me&#x2014;otherwise it&#x2019;s right back to that fried chicken! I look to Bobby when I need inspiration for that kind of cooking. He&#x2019;s so clever when it comes to cooking fish or coming up with healthy grilling recipes for a cookout. That&#x2019;s where his cooking really shines.<br> <br>I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy learning a little more about where all the great food in my life comes from, and I know you&#x2019;ll love trying your hand at my family recipes&#x2014; they&#x2019;re all time-tested and Paula-approved, I guarantee!<br> <br>I wish you best dishes, y&#x2019;all&#x2014;from my family to yours.<br> <br>� 2009 Alan richardson</p><h2>Mischief Season (The Witches of Benevento)</h2><p>The first book in an exciting new chapter book series by <b>John Bemelmans Marciano</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Caldecott medalist Sophie Blackall</b>.&nbsp;<b><br><br>Welcome to Benevento, an ancient town famous for its witches!</b><br><br>The children of Benevento have to be&nbsp;careful and clever to evade the clutches of such witches as the Manalonga, the Janara, and the Clopper,&nbsp;who hide in wells and under bridges, fly at midnight, and play tricks during Mischief Season.<br><br>Five cousins &#x2013; Primo, Emilio, Rosa, Maria Beppina, and Sergio &#x2013; share adventures and narrow escapes, and discover astonishing secrets as they outwit the witches in each exciting story.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Book #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Mischief Season: a Twins Story</b><br>The Janara are wrecking the farm with their nightly mischiefs.

An A-Z Guide. (Volume 6) (Crystal Prescriptions, 6)</h2><p>This immensely practical sixth book in the <em>Crystal Prescriptions</em> series covers crystals for karmic clearing, soul integration and healing the family tree. In addition to our own karma, we are hampered by ancestral memories, attitudes and beliefs that are not necessarily &#x2018;ours' but we have inherited them and, all too unconsciously, replay them time and again. They are carried in our &#x2018;junk DNA', and we have to work with them until cleared. Many people in incarnation now came in with the intention of being lineage breakers: healers for the collective and the ancestral line in addition to their personal karmic past. Fortunately some extraordinary new crystals have appeared which help us to do exactly that quickly, easily and without having to relive the trauma and dramas of karmic history. With the assistance of these crystals, and some old favourites, it is possible to heal far back into the genealogical line and our own karmic past. The healing is then projected forward into the future so that the generations to come can have the benefit of garnered soul and ancestral wisdom but without the baggage. An A-Z directory of appropriate crystals assists you to identify exactly the right crystal for your needs.</p><p>An internationally known author, astrologer, psychic, healer and workshop leader, Judy Hall has been a karmic counsellor for over forty five years and is the author of the million-selling <em>Crystal Bibles</em>.

She was recently voted the Kindred Spirit MBS personality of the year 2014 and has appeared four times on the Watkins MBS list of 100 most spiritually influential living writers.The information in the newest instalment in the Crystal Prescriptions series couldn't be any timelier or more vital to the health and well-being of our planet as a whole. Judy guides the reader through a compassionate, intelligent, and eminently sensible journey of healing the karma that holds us all back. Her work is based on the fundamental observation that transforming this karmic energy is mandatory for our evolution, and that it will help everyone on our planet from now on. The practical exercises, layouts, and rituals are enjoyable and give the reader the ability to internalise the practical information. Judy even takes a deeper look into our subtle anatomy through the karmic lens, giving readers unprecedented insight into how and why karma shapes our lives. This book is a treasure trove of information, one that you'll turn to again and again. (Nicholas Pearson, author of The Seven Archetypal Stones and Crystals for Karmic Healing)<br><br>The perfect book to read on the cusp of a solar eclipse. This book of prescriptions gives the reader an excellent alternative to Western medicine with that being a holistic soul cleansing. Starting off with an introduction section to give the reader an extensive background into chakras, auras and some common mental illnesses, as well as some useful ways to find a person's particular prescription, she then delves further into the universe of karma and the soul and ends with a reminder on ancestral healing. The way each part compounds onto the other mimics the ascension we, as energy beings attempt to reach. We start as soul's with karmic debt and lessons, and once we have overcome those we transcend to become ancestors. The very end of the book gives an exhaustive list of the various crystals and how they can be used for healing purposes. For those new or old to the practice, or want to know more about it, I would definitely recommend this book.

The renowned writer and filmmaker treks through rain forests and deserts, through city streets and isolated wilderness, to bring us an illuminating panorama of every aspect of birds' lives--from their songs to their search for food, from their eggs and nests to their mastery of the air. Beautifully illustrated with more than a hundred color photographs, the book will delight and inform both bird lovers and any general reader with an interest in nature.</p><br><p> Attenborough begins at the beginning: reviewing ideas about how and when creatures first took to the air--and why ostriches, kiwis, and other flightless birds later returned to the ground. He introduces us to the marvels of flight. We encounter the albatross, which can soar for hours without flapping its wings; hummingbirds that beat their wings two hundred times a minute; and the swift, which eats, sleeps, and mates in mid-air. We read about birds' extraordinary methods of hunting and gathering--about crows that use twigs and leaves to hook and harpoon insects, and eagles that can stamp venomous snakes to death. Attenborough explains why and how birds sing and why many have such dazzling plumage. He reviews courtship and mating strategies, including the extravagant dances of cranes and the bizarre and ornate pavilions that male bowerbirds build to attract females. We learn how birds defend their young against predators. Attenborough explains how birds have colonized the globe more effectively than any other vertebrates, adapting to Antarctic winters and African summers, to vast oceans and the densest, most polluted cities. He also outlines the threat that humans pose to many species, showing how we have already driven many to extinction.</p><br><p> The book presents birds in all their complexity and glory, revealing in clear and elegant prose Attenborough's infectious sense of wonder about the rich variety of life on Earth.</p></p><p>Tireless explorer of the natural world and wide-ranging traveler, documentary filmmaker and writer David Attenborough has delighted readers and viewers with such productions as <i>Life on Earth</i> and <i>The Living Planet</i>. In this companion to a 10-part PBS series of the same name, Attenborough examines the ways of bird species from prehistoric times to the present, writing, as he admits, from the viewpoint of an amateur with a particular interest in animal behavior. (Those who can distinguish a bird at sight or by song possess a skill, he writes, "which I greatly admire, but one, alas, that I do not possess.") That amateur passion yields a fine overview of avian biology, as Attenborough turns to such matters as the antiquity of birds, which have dominated the air for some 150 million years, and the adaptation of birds to every ecosystem on the planet--for no obstacle, from huge mountains to wide oceans, has been able to stop their colonizing the whole of the globe, including the artificial deserts of major cities, where pigeons and peregrines rule. Graced with 180 color photographs, Attenborough's book will delight birdwatchers, students of animal behavior, and admirers of good writing alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>Sir David Attenborough</b>, a Fellow of the Royal Society, is also a Trustee of the British Museum and an Honorary Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.

Do you ever ponder about how very long you have been promised that &#34;Jesus is coming soon,&#34; but He has not? If so, then Christianity&#39;s Great Dilemma may be the most unusual, interesting, and perhaps enlightening Second Coming prophecy book you will ever read! For most of my fifty of years preaching I taught that Jesus&#39; Second Coming was near, so near that I expected to live to see the Advent. The ministers I listened to as a boy had the same message and expectation, but they died without seeing Jesus. Most ministers of the past hundred years have proclaimed that &#34;Jesus is coming soon,&#34; but He has not returned. Do you ever wonder why? Modern-day prophets have kept us in great anticipation as they predicted the imminent coming of the antichrist, along with the great tribulation, rapture, end of the world, end of time, and Armageddon. Do you ever consider that decades pass, and one century ends and another begins, yet NONE of these prophecies come to pass? Recall Y2K. As the year 2000 approached, preachers made many predictions; and NOTHING happened! How embarrassing to Christianity! Could something be wrong with our message? In my book you will find the answers to these troubling questions! The answers are not some imaginary or hypothetical solutions, or some invisible and intangible possibilities. The answers are firmly and solidly based on the Scriptures! How did I miss them for most of my life? Christianity&#39;s Great Dilemma is a MUST-READ BOOK for every studious, thoughtful, and sincere Christian! I humbly invite you to read it. I promise that you will find it honest, unique, interesting, and even challenging. And your walk with Jesus will never be the same!</p><p>Glenn Hill, age 70, is a retired pastor and businessman.

The <i>New York Times </i>called it the <i>"</i>first bona-fide walk . . . across the American continent," and eagerly chronicled a journey in which Weston was beset by fatigue, mosquitos, vicious headwinds, and brutal heat. He was 70 years old.<br><br>In The Last Great Walk, journalist Wayne Curtis uses the framework of Weston's fascinating and surprising story, and investigates exactly what we lost when we turned away from foot travel, and what we could potentially regain with America's new embrace of pedestrianism. From how our brains and legs evolved to accommodate our ancient traveling needs to the way that American cities have been designed to cater to cars and discourage pedestrians, Curtis guides readers through an engaging, intelligent exploration of how something as simple as the way we get from one place to another continues to shape our health, our environment, and even our national identity.<br>Not walking, he argues, may be one of the most radical things humans have ever done.</p><p>Wayne Curtis is a contributing editor at The Atlantic magazine.

At twenty-five minutes past four on a clear, chilly late winter afternoon in 1909, an elderly man walked out of the main New York post office, opposite City Hall in lower Manhattan, and paused for a moment on the uppermost step. He was wiry and taut and stood about five foot eight and weighed around 125 �ds. He wasn't remarkable physically, but he wasn't the sort to blend in, either. On this March day, he wore a blue frock coat and a large white hat ("a sombrero in all but color," as an observer described it) and what one reporter referred to as "mouse-colored leggings." In one hand he held a small cane, and with the other he fidgeted with his trademark mustache, a large and silvery thing that draped his upper lip, resting a few inches below twinkling eyes, which seemed to find private amusement in public commotion.<br><br>Edward Payson Weston was planning to take a long walk. He was off to a late start--inside the post office, a crowd of well-wishers had mobbed him, delaying his departure. Edward Morgan, the city's postmaster, had emerged from his office to greet him personally. With a wry smile, Morgan handed Weston an envelope containing a letter, asking that he deliver it to his counterpart in San Francisco. Morgan reminded Weston that he could collect eighty-five cents upon delivery. Everybody laughed.<br><br>Morgan also wished Weston well on his seventieth birthday. A few hurrahs were offered. And once the small talk and good wishes tapered off, Weston said his farewells and exited the post office through tall doors. Ahead of him was City Hall, with its Corinthian and Ionic pilasters, a neoclassical pile with French trimmings; above him, the mansard-roofed post office stood with the whimsical sternness of a bulldog wearing a derby hat. But people, more than his Beaux Arts surroundings, defined the scene: A minor mob had followed Weston out of the building, and a far larger and more raucous crowd had amassed out front to witness the first steps of his walk. One reporter sent to cover the scene estimated that ten thousand spectators clogged the streets and sidewalks around the post office, cheering and clamoring for a glimpse of the elderly walker. When he emerged, they let loose with a roar and pressed in to get a better look. "For a moment it seemed that the police guard would be swept away," the New York Times reported. Weston later admitted that the commotion "frightened [him] to death," his anxiety no doubt com�ded by his fear that an eager, oafish spectator might step on one of his feet and hobble him before he even began. This had happened on a long walk he had undertaken two years earlier, and the experience left him skittish and wary.<br><br>Weston at last doffed his hat to the crowd, then plunged down the steps and into the mob. He slowly made his way forward, thanks chiefly to the brawn of two strapping policemen, longtime friends Ben and Dan Rinn. The Rinns were minor celebrities in their own right--a few years earlier, they had been first on the scene when President Teddy Roosevelt's horse-drawn carriage was broadsided by a streetcar in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The brothers happened to be nearby on vacation; one ran for medical help, and the other held the streetcar motorman captive until local authorities arrived. (The accident earned a small footnote in history: A Secret Service agent died in the crash, becoming the first agent killed in the line of duty.)<br><br>A posse of New York mounted police officers aided the Rinns in crowd control, riding into the rabble and parting a way for the walker. Veterans of Company B of the Army's Seventh Regiment, led by one Captain James E. Schuyler, also did their best to keep the crowd at bay. Weston had aided the company in a small espionage matter years ago, and some of the regiment had reunited to escort him on the start of his journey. The regiment had also hired the Metropolitan Band to follow him during the first part of his walk, and it was noisily striking up a brassy tune, which attracted even more gawkers and followers.<br><br>As a path opened in the crowd, Weston started to gather speed and gradually hit a stride of about three and a half to four miles per hour. "He is a marvel of endurance and determination," wrote an admiring reporter in the Times-Leader of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. "He is more like a tireless machine than a human being."<br><br>At minimum, Weston would need to be a marvel. His plan was to walk that afternoon and evening to Tarrytown, about thirty miles up the Hudson River. He would follow the Hudson the next day toward Albany, then turn west and go on to Chicago and then on and on, across the windswept plains and over and around the formidable Rockies and High Sierras, eventually arriving in San Francisco after some four thousand miles on foot. He told everyone who would listen that he was confident he would make the trip within a hundred days. This pace would preclude much dawdling, and essentially meant he'd have to walk forty miles every day, not counting Sundays, which he always took as a day of rest.<br><br>Even if he succeeded, this trek would not be his longest walk--years before, in England, he had once covered five thousand miles in a hundred days--but this would surely be his most challenging. And by any measure, it would require a lot of steps: approximately 8.2 million, or more than eighty thousand each and every day of his walk. A typical American today walks an average of roughly five thousand steps daily, or somewhat less than two and a half miles, doing errands, foraging around in the kitchen, chasing after a football in the backyard, crossing the shopping mall parking lot, walking down a row of cubicles to discuss with a colleague a recent memo. Weston would do that sixteenfold every day. What's more, Weston embarked on his cross-country trek in an era when the nation was not well suited for transcontinental crossings unless you were traveling by rail, in which case you could argue that the cross-country transportation network was at its apogee. While sleeping in a plush, well-tended Pullman car, you could make it from New York to Chicago in sixteen hours. (Today, it takes about twenty hours on Amtrak.) Three years earlier a train had made it from San Francisco to New York in seventy-one and a half hours, and the Harriman Special regularly made the trip in five days. But walking anywhere outside cities could be slow and sloggy. Roadways were primitive at best--outside the cities, hardly any long-distance routes were paved with macadam or brick or cobblestones. Most were composed of loosely compressed dirt liable to turn rutty when wet and dusty when dry. Hotels and inns could be found in the small towns Weston passed through in the East and Upper Midwest, but, like the towns themselves, these became more fugitive and widely scattered as he pushed westward, and he would have to count more on the kindness of strangers.<br><br>Weston faced another danger: Noisy, belching horseless carriages were taking to the roadways in ever-greater numbers. In 1909, some 126,593 cars had been manufactured--more than half of them touring cars, acquired for recreation rather than commerce. Inexperienced drivers, who had to be wealthy enough to splurge on what was still a novelty, would weave pell- mell down rough, potholed streets. Walkers, once kings of the road, now found that they had to scuttle to the margins to avoid being hit, and almost every day some metropolitan newspaper ran an account or two of a pedestrian run over by an automobile. A 1905 book titled Automobilia was filled with poems, anecdotes, and jokes involving these new conveyances. Among them: "Have you made a record with your automobile yet?" someone asks a driver. "Oh, yes" is the cheerful reply. "Two dogs, a chicken, three small boys, and a street cleaner, all run over in less than an hour."<br><br>The day Weston left New York, a man named Arthur Subers was crossing a street in downtown Chicago on foot. He was run over by not one, not two, but by three automobiles in succession. Subers miraculously escaped without serious injury. It was, perhaps, the first triple pedestrian-automobile accident in history. Subers had gotten in the way of progress, and progress would not be stopped.<br><br>Three weeks before Weston set off from the front steps of the New York post office, an essay appeared on the front page of the influential Parisian newspaper Le Figaro. It was titled "The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism." The essay was by and large an obituary for anything that moved at a pedestrian's pace, and a celebration of anything that zipped along speedily. It was written by a lavishly mustachioed Italian writer and theorist named Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who recounted a recent episode in which he was driving an automobile and encountered two oncoming cyclists-- "their stupid swaying got in my way," as he put it. He avoided them, but his car ended up in a muddy gully. He emerged from the "maternal ditch" as if being born anew into a world where speed was now sacred--it ennobled man, and those who did not embrace swiftness (like those on their stupid bikes) would be left behind and one day awaken to find themselves on the refuse heap of civilization. The decaying past was slow moving, embraced only by nostalgists who longed for a static landscape and lowing cows.<br><br>"We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed," Marinetti wrote. "A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath . . . a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace."<br><br>Marinetti and his followers saw in speed not just dispatch and expediency and inevitability, but also an aesthetic and moral good, and something that would improve the lot of all mankind. Unknowingly, he was laying the theoretical foundations for streamlined designs in cars and trains and for ever-widening road networks. In his other writings he noted that "slowness is naturally foul," and he heralded "a new good: speed, and a new evil: slowness." Marinetti and his followers called for a great public works project in Venice to fill in "the small, stinking canals with the rubble from the old, collapsing and leprous palaces." To the north, he wanted to straighten the Danube, allowing it to flow unhindered and expeditiously. The future was sleek, the future was fast. For a time, Marinetti was influential among the emerging fascist movement, and he pushed (unsuccessfully) for futurism to be made the official state art of Italy.<br><br>It was into this world that Weston, the walker, walked.<br><br>"Walking with elasticity of step and freedom of action that was the absolute contradiction of age," Weston pushed on through lower Manhattan with "a springy step and a generally jaunty air," according to the New York Times. Another correspondent wrote that he looked "as blithe and as vigorous as most men half his age." The Atlanta Constitution marveled at the huge crowd that had turned out to "cheer the plucky old trudger." The Boston Globe's headline: "Weston Off on His Long Walk; . . . Elderly Athlete Cheered by Thousands at Start."<br><br>Behind the public tumult and outward pep, Weston's nerves were undoubtedly running high. While publicly confident, he was privately worried about whether he'd actually make even the first thirty miles to Tarrytown. He'd started preparing for this walk months earlier by walking twenty-five or thirty miles daily. At the outset of his walk he was on his home turf, having lived in New York for many years. But his warm-up walks hadn't gone terrifically well. One of his feet came up sore, and his doctor advised him to ease up on his training regimen. So Weston walked just five miles daily immediately prior to his departure, and five miles was barely a warm-up for a walker of his stamina and habits. The afternoon he departed, he later said, he was still "suffering from great pain," although he was confident he could work through it; he always did, he said, insisting that a good walk was the best tonic known to mankind and could cure just about any malady, including that of the foot.<br><br>Surrounded by the jostling crowd, Weston turned north up Lafayette Street past City Hall and continued onward to Fourth Avenue. Those on the fringe would surge ahead and jockey for the best viewing positions along the curb to watch as Weston passed by. He soldiered on through the teeming assemblage, glancing upward at the buildings from time to time to ensure he was still headed in the right direction.<br><br>All the commotion no doubt provoked some nostalgia. Decades earlier, from the 1860s through the 1880s, a much-younger Weston had drawn crowds even larger than these--along with similarly fawning newspaper coverage--for his astounding feats of pedestrianism.<br><br>The Walking Man, as Weston was known, possibly the most indefatigable long- distance walker ever to stride across our planet's surface, was born on March 15, 1839, in Providence, Rhode Island. His father, Silas Weston, was a descendent of Mayflower passengers and worked mostly as a school principal and teacher, but sometimes as a shopkeeper. He stood six foot four and liked to play the bass viol. Edward's mother, Maria, wrote children's books. They had two girls and two boys, with Edward being the older of their sons. He weighed four and a half �ds at birth and was so frail he wasn't expected to survive.<br><br>As a child, Weston was considered a sweet and obedient boy, though weak of constitution and often somewhat sickly. Still, he was perpetually restless. ("There was no keeping him still," his Sunday school teacher once recalled, adding that he "was the most uneasy bright boy I ever saw.") His father left New England in pursuit of adventure and California gold in 1849 and remained in the West for three years. When he returned (largely gold-less), Weston was captivated by his father's tales and wrote up several of his accounts. He had these printed in pamphlet form, which he then sold along with the newspapers he was hawking as a newsboy on the passenger rail lines to New York and Boston. When Weston was fifteen, his mother recruited a friend who was also a coach in an effort to improve her son's health. The coach first instructed Edward to abandon coffee, then put him on a regimen of milk and vegetables. He also instructed him to undertake short, vigorous walks every day.</p><h2>Cinematography: Third Edition</h2><p><b>The Essential Guide to the Cameraman's Craft</b> <br> Since its initial publication in 1973, <i>Cinematography</i> has become the guidebook for filmmakers.

He helped to design the film department of the California Institute of the Arts and taught film at the Film Division of The Polytechnic in London, England.<br><br><b>M. David Mullen, ASC,</b> graduated from UCLA and the California Institute of the Arts graduate film program. He has photographed nearly thirty films over the past decade and has earned two IFP/Independent Spirit nominations for best cinematography.<b>Chapter One: Cameras</b> <p> The cinematographer's most basic tool is the motion picture camera. This piece of precision machinery comprises scores of coordinated functions, each of which demands understanding and care if the camera is to produce the best and most consistent results. The beginning cinematographer's goal should be to become thoroughly familiar and comfortable with the camera's operation, so that he or she can concentrate on the more creative aspects of cinematography. </p><p> This chapter covers many isolated bits of practical information. However, once you become familiar with camera operation, you will be able to move on to the substance of the cinematographer's craft in subsequent chapters. In the meantime, you are well advised to try to absorb each operation-oriented detail presented in this chapter, because operating a camera is <i>all</i> details. If any detail is neglected, the quality of the work may be impaired. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>Principle of Intermittent Movement</b> <p> The film movement mechanism is what really distinguishes a cinema camera from a still camera. The illusion of image motion is created by a rapid succession of still photographs. To arrest every frame for the time of exposure, the principle of an intermittent mechanism was borrowed from clocks and sewing machines. Almost all general-purpose motion picture cameras employ the intermittent principle. </p><p> Intermittent mechanisms vary in design. All have a pull-down claw and pressure plate. Some have a registration pin as well. The pull-down claw engages the film perforation and moves the film down one frame. It then disengages and goes back up to pull down the next frame. While the claw is disengaged, the pressure plate holds the film steady for the period of exposure. Some cameras have a registration pin that enters the film perforation for extra steadiness while the exposure is made. </p><p> Whatever mechanism is employed requires the best materials and machining possible, which is one reason good cameras are expensive. The film gate (the part of the camera where the pressure plate, pull-down claw, and registration pin engage the film) needs a good deal of attention during cleaning and threading. The film gate is never too clean. This is the area where the exposure takes place, so any particles of dirt or hair will show on the exposed film and perhaps scratch it. In addition to miscellaneous debris such as sand, hair, and dust, sometimes a small amount of emulsion comes off the passing film and collects in the gate. It must be removed. This point is essential. On feature films, some camera assistants clean the gate after every shot. They know that one grain of sand or bit of emulsion can ruin a day's work. </p><p> The gate should first be cleaned with a rubber-bulb syringe or compressed air to blow foreign particles away. Cans of compressed air must be used in an upright position; otherwise they will spray a gluey substance into the camera. When blowing out the aperture, it is recommended that you spray from the open lens port side, with the mirror shutter cleared out of the way, through the aperture, rather than from inside the threading area into the aperture. This helps prevent blowing particles into the mirror area. An orangewood stick, available wherever cosmetics are sold, can then be used to remove any sticky emulsion buildup. There is also an ARRI plastic "skewer" for this job, bent at the end to allow you to get the inner edges of the aperture better. The gate and pressure plate should also be wiped with a clean chamois cloth -- never with linen. <i>Never use metal tools for cleaning the gate,</i> or, for that matter, for cleaning any part of the film movement mechanism, because these may cause abrasions that in turn will scratch the passing film. Do not use Q-tips either, as these will leave lint behind. </p><p> The gate should be cleaned every time the camera is reloaded. At the same time, the surrounding camera interior and magazine should also be cleaned to ensure that no dirt will find its way to the gate while the camera is running. </p><p> The intermittent movement requires the film to be slack so that as it alternately stops and jerks ahead in one-frame advances, there will be no strain on it. Therefore, one or two sprocket rollers are provided to maintain two loops, one before and one after the gate. In some cameras (such as the Bolex and Canon Scoopic), a self-threading mechanism forms the loops automatically. In Super-8 cassettes and cartridges, the loops are already formed by the manufacturer. On manually threaded cameras, the film path showing loop size is usually marked. </p><p> Too small a loop will not absorb the jerks of the intermittent movement, resulting in picture unsteadiness, scratched film, broken perforations, and possibly a camera jam. An oversize loop may vibrate against the camera interior and also cause an unsteady picture and scratched film. Either too large or too small a loop will also contribute to camera noise. </p><p> <b>Camera Speeds</b> </p><p> The speed at which the intermittent movement advances the film is expressed in frames per second (fps). Each frame exposed is a single sample of a moving subject, so the higher the sampling rate, that is, the faster the frame rate, the smoother the motion will be reproduced. To reproduce movement on the screen faithfully, the film must be projected at the <i>same</i> speed as it was shot. Standard shooting and projection speed for 16mm and 35mm is 24 fps; standard speeds for 8mm and Super-8 are 24 fps for sound and 18 fps (or 24 fps) for silent. </p><p> If both the camera and the projector are run at the <i>same</i> speeds, say 24 fps, then the action will be faithfully reproduced. However, if the camera runs <i>slower</i> than the projector, the action will appear to move <i>faster</i> on the screen than it did in real life. For example, an action takes place in four seconds (real time) and it is photographed at 12 fps. That means that the four seconds of action is recorded over forty-eight frames. If it is now projected at standard sound speed of 24 fps, it will take only two seconds to project. Therefore, the action that took four seconds in real life is sped up to two seconds on the screen because the camera ran slower than the projector. </p><p> The opposite is also true. If the camera runs <i>faster</i> than the projector, the action will be slowed down in projection. So to obtain slow motion, speed the camera up; to obtain fast motion, slow the camera down. </p><p> This variable speed principle has several applications. Time-lapse photography can compress time and make very slow movement visible, such as the growth of a flower or the movement of clouds across the sky. Photographing slow-moving clouds at a rate of, say, one frame every three seconds will make them appear to be rushing through the screen when the film is projected at 24 fps. On the other hand, movements filmed at 36 fps or faster acquire a slow, dreamy quality at 24 fps on the screen. Such effects can be used to create a mood or analyze a movement. A very practical use of slow motion is to smooth out a jerky camera movement such as a rough traveling shot. The jolts are less prominent in slow motion. </p><p> To protect the intermittent movement, never run the camera at high speeds when it is not loaded. </p><p> When sound movies arrived in 1927, 24 fps was firmly established as the standard shooting and projection rate, although it was a frame rate occasionally used by Silent Era filmmakers. It is not actually the ideal frame rate for the recreation of motion, as it provides barely enough individual motion samples over time to create the sensation of smooth, continuous motion when played back. However, it's become the frame rate that audiences are most accustomed to seeing in movies and has become an integral part of the "film look" that many people discuss these days as they attempt to get video technology to emulate film. The main artifacts to this fairly low frame rate are strobing and flicker. <i>Strobing</i> is the effect of sensing that the motion is made up of too few samples and therefore does not feel continuous. One of the ramifications is that it is sometimes necessary to minimize fast movement, such as when panning the camera across a landscape; otherwise the motion seems too staccato, too jumpy. <i>Flicker</i> happens when the series of still images are not being flashed quickly enough for the viewer to perceive the light and image as being continuously "on." The solution generally has been for film projectors to use a twin-bladed shutter to double the number of times the same film frame is flashed before the next frame is shown. So even if the movie was shot and then projected at 24 fps, the viewer is seeing forty-eight flashes per second on the screen. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>Shutter</b> <p> A change in camera speed will cause a change in shutter speed. In most cameras the shutter consists of a rotating disk with a 180* cutout (a half circle). As the disk rotates it closes over the aperture, stopping exposure and allowing the movement to advance the film to the next frame. Rotating further, the cutout portion allows the new frame to be exposed and then covers it again for the next pull-down. The shutter rotates constantly, and therefore the film is exposed half the time and covered the other half. So when the camera is running at 24 fps, the actual period of exposure for each frame is 1/48 second (half of 1/24). Varying the speed of the camera also changes the exposure time. For example, by <i>slowing</i> the movement by half, or to 12 fps, we <i>increase</i> the exposure period for each frame, from 1/48 to 1/24 second. Similarly, by <i>speeding up</i> the movement, doubling it from the normal 24 fps to 48 fps, we <i>reduce</i> the exposure period from 1/48 to 1/96 second. Knowing these relationships, we can adjust the f-stop to compensate for the change in exposure time when filming fast or slow motion. </p><p> A change in the speed of film movement can be useful when filming at low light levels. For example, suppose you are filming a cityscape at dusk and there is not enough light. By reducing your speed t...</p></p><h2>The Quest for a Moral Compass: A Global History of Ethics</h2><p><b>The story of the global search for moral truths</b><br><br>In this remarkable and groundbreaking book, Kenan Malik explores the history of moral thought as it has developed over three millennia, from Homer&#x2019;s Greece to Mao&#x2019;s China, from ancient India to modern America.

As Western societies are becoming increasingly mixed-race, demographic change is transforming politics. Over half of American babies are non-white, and by the end of the century, minorities and those of mixed race are projected to form the majority in the UK and other countries.

Ethnic transformation will continue, but conservative whites are unlikely to exit quietly; their feelings of alienation are already redrawing political lines and convulsing societies across the West.

For all graphic novel collections. (Mahnaz Dar <i>As the Crow Flies by Melanie Gillman | SLJ Review</i>)<br><br><p>Over the course of the last several years, Iron Circus Comics has earned a legion of fans and a slew of critical successes by publishing books that appeal to readers who don&#x2019;t often find themselves represented in the pages put out by traditional publishers. Owner C. Spike Trotman began her company with female- and LGBTQIA-friendly erotica anthologies called <em>Smut Peddler</em>, and the vast majority of the books she puts out continue in that vein, though not all of them have contained erotica. Many of the books are print versions of successful webcomics, bringing the work to an even larger population and creating a strong symbiotic relationship between Iron Circus&#x2019; fans and those of the webcomics. Trotman&#x2019;s strategies are too successful to be ignored, and her business is one of the best examples of how the industry must change to survive.</p> <p><em>As The Crow Flies</em> is one of the three books Iron Circus funded this year, and the first to reach readers. It collects the first volume of Melanie Gillman&#x2019;s excellent webcomic of the same name, a story about an all-girls sleepaway camp and the troop who goes there one summer. The focus is on Charlie, a 13-year-old who feels out of place at the overtly religious and adamantly female-focused camp, isolated from everyone else by race, orientation, and the fact that Charlie clearly has a better understanding of what feminism is than most of the adults running the place. It&#x2019;s an emotional and intimate comic, restrained in many ways and deeply personal, with a backdrop of stunning mountain vistas.</p> <p>Gillman&#x2019;s remarkable skill at portraying the way that microaggressions and small slights can quickly escalate to create an environment that&#x2019;s emotionally crushing and dangerous is something that is hard to find anywhere else. There are comics, especially webcomics, that portray otherness well, but what sets Gillman&#x2019;s work apart is their ability to show how we are othered by the people in our lives, and how that creates anxiety and isolation that can be nearly impossible to overcome, especially for young people. Charlie is a complicated, nuanced, and sympathetic protagonist, and this year Gillman added &#x201c;Pockets&#x201d; to their website, a short comic about Charlie&#x2019;s friend Tilly, creating even more emotional weight and investment as they expand Charlie&#x2019;s world.</p> <p>Alone, that emotional depth would make Gillman&#x2019;s work well worth picking up. What makes <em>As The Crow Flies</em> even better is the art. Characters are drawn simply, but without feeling cartoonish or overblown. Expressions and body language are real and weighty instead of outsized. The characters range in shape and size in the way real teen and tween girls do, and it gives the whole book a sense of reality that&#x2019;s needed to underpin all that emotional weight. Gillman works almost exclusively in colored pencils, and in an age when many comics are drawn digitally it lends texture and color to the art that&#x2019;s hard to find in most comics. Plant life looks lush and alive, rocks and dirt solid. Gillman doesn&#x2019;t shy away from showing the effort that goes into hiking up a mountain, but they also make sure that readers understand why so many people do it: the views make it worthwhile.</p> <p><em>As The Crow Flies</em> certainly isn&#x2019;t the only comic about summer camp, but it is one of the only ones that&#x2019;s honest about how much summer camp can suck, how much being a teenager usually sucks, and how much being from a group that&#x2019;s marginalized and forgotten only makes the teenager part suck more.

(Sarah Hunter <i>As the Crow Flies</i>)<br><br>"As The Crow Flies" certainly isn't the only comic about summer camp, but it is one of the only ones that's honest about how much summer camp can suck, how much being a teenager usually sucks, and how much being from a group that's marginalized and forgotten only makes the teenager part suck more. It's a story that embraces the truth of how bad things can be without abandoning kindness, and that's something comics could use a lot more of. (<i>As The Crow Flies examines marginalization and how much summer camp can suck in equal measure</i>)<br><br><p>Collecting Melanie Gillman&#x2019;s continuing and multiple award-nominated webcomic in a first volume, <em>As the Crow Flies</em> was successfully crowdfunded earlier this year and brought to print by Iron Circus comics. The book follows a week in the life of queer 13-year-old Charlie Lamonte at Camp Three Peaks &#x2013; a rural Christian retreat where teenage girls follow in the footsteps of a group of 19th century pioneering women by retracing their annual all-woman pilgrimage.</p> <p>The only black member of the trip, Charlie&#x2019;s already faltering religious convictions are put to the test as the week progresses. While the rigid traditions and spiritual dogma of the hike become more and more questionable Charlie finds a supportive presence in fellow camper Sydney and they both begin to challenge the ideals of the camp that the others take for granted.</p> <p>Gillman&#x2019;s greatest strength as a storyteller is their ability to bring us so fully into Charlie&#x2019;s perspective, underlining the unconscious bias and exclusionary behaviour she is forced to deal with throughout her backpacking trip. That sense of marginalisation is sometimes overt &#x2013; an early sequence where a hike leader obliviously talks about &#x201c;whitening our souls&#x201d; for example &#x2013; while on other occasions it&#x2019;s depicted more subtly but no less effectively in visual terms, with Charlie often portrayed on-panel as spatially isolated even within her peer group.</p> <p>In Sydney, Charlie finds a confidante who allows her to more directly examine the doubts she has about her place at the camp. An event that was supposed to be a celebration of liberation and inclusivity slowly begins to reveal itself as one steeped rather in privilege and exclusivity, and the pair find themselves united in a common cause. Characterisation is delicately observed &#x2013; both visually and through the book&#x2019;s employment of naturalistic dialogue (particularly in a latter scene where the girls discuss the assignation of a gender to God) &#x2013; ensuring audience investment in the characters as we too react to events through their eyes.</p> <p>Gillman&#x2019;s panel-to-panel storytelling emphasises a sense of place through the frequent intermittent multi-page scenes of the group traipsing through the stunningly beautiful countryside. There&#x2019;s a pacing here that asks the reader to slow down their reading speed and immerse themselves in each single, evocatively coloured panel, creating a sense of lingering time as each day of the hike passes. Frequent changes in perspective remind us of the majesty of the sprawling terrain the group are traversing.</p> <p>Gillman&#x2019;s command of the pure language of comics, though, adds so many extra thematic layers to the book. The recurring and significant motif of a floating feather falling through individual images in an early sequence, for example, or their use of speech balloons and panels to zoom in and out and highlight Charlie&#x2019;s feelings of detachment even when she&#x2019;s in the company of others.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s a particularly effective run of pages towards the end of this volume that place smaller panels within panels to signify the bustle of activity from the rest of the hikers while ensuring our focus remains on Charlie. It leads into a number of pages of varying panel sizes that play with our conceptions of time passing and between-the-panels comprehension to powerful effect.</p> <p>Most importantly, though, this is a book that, as the Kickstarter promotional material pointed out, can now be found in print by the &#x201c;real Charlies and Sydneys of the world&#x201d; and one that, in microcosm, speaks to us all about the unconscious biases and entrenched inequalities that permeate every strata of our societal structures. Gillman&#x2019;s story continues here online but this first print collection will hopefully ensure the story reaches the even wider readership it deserves.</p> (Andy Oliver <i>Broken Frontier</i>)<br><br><p>Gillman&#x2019;s brutally honest and wrenchingly beautiful story of friendship explores the simultaneous pain and joy of being young and queer. On Charlie&#x2019;s first day at a Christian sleepaway camp for girls, she sees what she believes to be a sign from God, but she has a crisis of faith after she discovers she&#x2019;s the only black girl in attendance and the camp staff start treating her badly. Their cruelty only grows worse during her group&#x2019;s hike to a centuries-old ceremonial retreat in the mountains. On the way, Charlie meets Sydney, a transgender girl who&#x2019;s just as fed up with their privileged counselor and oblivious peers, and the two band together for support during the emotionally and physically grueling ordeal. The book is unflinching in its examination of how solidarity among white, cisgender women can harm others. Charlie&#x2019;s pain is palpable, as are Sydney&#x2019;s alienation and fear, producing a story that&#x2019;s as resonant for marginalized readers as it is enlightening for those it critiques. Throughout, Gillman&#x2019;s meticulously realized colored pencil landscapes remain impeccable. This book radiates love and melancholy in equal measure. <em>(Nov.)</em></p> (<i>As the Crow Flies</i>)<br><br><p>When 13-year-old Charlie, a black, queer girl, embarks on a feminist Christian backpacking trip, she hopes it will deepen her relationship with God. The beautiful mountains they hike through certainly spotlight the majesty of creation, but Charlie&#x2019;s the only black girl, and the hike leader&#x2019;s whitewashed understanding of spirituality and feminism makes it hard to feel connected to a tradition so bound up with the history of white supremacy. Still, though, there are moments of grace: her new friendship and solidarity with Sydney, a trans girl keeping her identity a secret to avoid scorn; the attractive daughter of the group&#x2019;s leader, who takes Charlie under her wing; and moments of quiet contemplation in a beautiful place. Gillman&#x2019;s lush, warm artwork, rendered entirely in colored pencil, brings the gorgeous scenery lovingly to life. The soft, luminous scenes of the mountains and nature emphasize the enormity of Charlie&#x2019;s undertaking, both spiritually and physically, and her interactions with the other people on the trip, from snickering over outdated concepts with Sydney to bringing up uncomfortable topics with adults, are nicely paced and expressive. With arresting artwork, this coming-of-age story, originally published as a webcomic, sensitively explores religion, spirituality, feminism, and friendship and perfectly balances thought-provoking moments with heartening humor. Perfect for anyone who loved Gene Luen Yang&#x2019;s <em>American Born Chinese</em> (2007). &#x2015; <em>Sarah Hunter</em></p> (Sarah Hunter <i>As the Crow Flies</i>)<br><br><p><strong>Gr 6 Up</strong> &#x2013;Charlie, 13, is excited to embark on an all-girls Christian camp&#x2019;s backpacking trip. However, despite Camp Three Peaks&#x2019; commitment to feminism, head counselor Bee and many of the campers are unwittingly racist and homophobic, and Charlie, who is black and queer, grapples with self-doubt. She confides in God, wondering if a feather that follows her on her trek is a sign from above, and her spirits lift as she bonds with the more outspoken Sydney, a trans girl who feels similarly alienated. This contemplative graphic novel, taken from Gillman&#x2019;s ongoing webcomic, perceptively explores race, gender, faith, and friendship. Elegantly composed, richly hued images vividly portray the lush forest setting and shy, thoughtful Charlie&#x2019;s inner turmoil as she yearns to voice her opinions. Scenes in which she appears on the periphery of panels or crowded by the speech bubbles of her insensitive fellow campers adroitly capture her isolation. Gillman zeroes in on seemingly small yet achingly relatable moments as Charlie and Sydney&#x2019;s friendship slowly develops. The book subtly folds in lessons about identity and the danger of assumptions; both girls learn and grow about each other, themselves, and the larger world. <strong>VERDICT</strong> Heartfelt, stimulating, and sure to spark discussion about feminism&#x2019;s often less than inclusive attitudes toward marginalized groups.

Yes, there is a church in the Islamic world. In some cases, the church is hidden and barely surviving. In other countries there has been a church since the time of Pentecost.

Her seven historical novels stand out for their vividness and rich detail. For Joan, these books were not works of the imagination but personal recollections of her previous lives. In&nbsp;Winged Pharaoh, Joan Grant tells the story of Sekeeta, the Pharaoh's daughter. The ancient Egyptians reserved the title of "Winged Pharaoh" for ruler-priests who possessed extra-sensory powers. When Sekeeta demonstrates psychic abilities, she is sent to the temple and trained to recall past lives. Upon the death of her father, she becomes a "Winged Pharaoh" - both priestess and Pharaoh - and leads her country with enlightenment. The most famous of Joan Grant's "Far Memory" novels, this book brings the grandeur, beauty, and mystery of ancient Egypt to life. Upon&nbsp;Winged Pharaoh's&nbsp;original publication in 1937, the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;called it "an unusual book that shines with fire."</p><p>The astonishing Joan Grant became aware as a child of her uncanny gift of &#34;far memory&#34;--an ability to recall in detail previous incarnations, both male and female, in other centuries and other lands. Her seven historical novels have been highly praised for their extraordinary vividness and richly diverting detail, and are in fact the author&#39;s memories of her earlier lives.An unusual book that shines with fire. -- <i>New York Times, 1937</i><br><br>Joan Grant is a writer with unique qualities.

It is at once her most uncharacteristic volume of essays and one of her most interesting. Rather than trace recent movie openings on a week-by-week basis, Kael here recalls classics by Ophuls, Renoir, and Bergman and comments on some of the international masterpieces of the early '60s. She also meditates on the state of the art in provocatively titled pieces like "Are Movies Going to Pieces?," "Fantasies of the Art House Audience," and "Is There a Cure for Film Criticism?" Few movie reviewers of any generation can match her wit or intelligence. And almost no one can equal her passion for an art that had such an indelible impact upon her life; Kael's treatment of Vittorio De Sica's masterpiece <i>Shoeshine</i> is perhaps the most intimate and beautiful movie review ever written.</p><h2>The Heart of Redness: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A startling novel by the leading writer of the new South Africa</b></p><p>In <i>The Heart of Redness</i> -- shortlisted for the prestigious Commonwealth Writers Prize -- Zakes Mda sets a story of South African village life against a notorious episode from the country's past. The result is a novel of great scope and deep human feeling, of passion and reconciliation. </p><p>As the novel opens Camugu, who left for America during apartheid, has returned to Johannesburg. Disillusioned by the problems of the new democracy, he follows his "famous lust" to Qolorha on the remote Eastern Cape. There in the nineteenth century a teenage prophetess named Nonqawuse commanded the Xhosa people to kill their cattle and burn their crops, promising that once they did so the spirits of their ancestors would rise and drive the occupying English into the ocean. The failed prophecy split the Xhosa into Believers and Unbelievers, dividing brother from brother, wife from husband, with devastating consequences. </p><p>One hundred fifty years later, the two groups' decendants are at odds over plans to build a vast casino and tourist resort in the village, and Camugu is soon drawn into their heritage and their future -- and into a bizarre love triangle as well.</p><p><i>The Heart of Redness</i> is a seamless weave of history, myth, and realist fiction. It is, arguably, the first great novel of the new South Africa -- a triumph of imaginative and historical writing.</p></p><p><p><b>Zakes Mda</b>, a novelist and playwright, has received every major South African prize for his work. A former visiting professor at Yale and the University of Vermont, he teaches at Ohio University and is the dramaturge at the Market Theatre, Johannesburg. He lives in Athens, Ohio.</p>1<br>&#x201c;Tears are very close to my eyes,&#x201d; says Bhonco, son of Ximiya. &#x201c;Not for pain . . . no . . . I do not cry because of pain. I cry only because of beautiful things.&#x201d;<br>And he cries often. Sometimes just a sniffle. Or a single tear down his cheek. As a result he carries a white handkerchief all the time, especially these days when peace has returned to the land and there is enough happiness to go around. It is shared like pinches of snuff. Rivers of salt. They furrow the aged face.<br>Bhonco is different from the other Unbelievers in his family, for Unbelievers are reputed to be such somber people that they do not believe even in those things that can bring happiness to their lives. They spend most of their time moaning about past injustices and bleeding for the world that would have been had the folly of belief not seized the nation a century and a half ago and spun it around until it was in a woozy stupor that is felt to this day. They also mourn the sufferings of the Middle Generations. That, however, is only whispered.<br>Bhonco does not believe in grieving. He has long accepted that what has happened has happened. It is cast in cold iron that does not entertain rust. His forebears bore the pain with stoicism. They lived with it until they passed on to the world of the ancestors.<br>Then came the Middle Generations. In between the forebears and this new world. And the Middle Generations fleeted by like a dream. Often like a nightmare. But now even the sufferings of the Middle Generations have passed. This is a new life, and it must be celebrated. Bhonco, son of Ximiya, celebrates it with tears.<br>NoPetticoat, his placable wife, is on the verge of losing patience with his tears. Whenever someone does a beautiful thing in the presence of her husband she screams, &#x201c;Stop! Please stop! Or you&#x2019;ll make Bhonco cry!&#x201d;<br>She dotes on him though, poor thing. People say it is nice to see such an aged couple&#x2014;who would be having grandchildren if their daughter, Xoliswa Ximiya, had not chosen to remain an old maid&#x2014;so much in love.<br>It is a wonderful sight to watch the couple walking side by side from a feast. He, tall and wiry with a deep chocolate face grooved with gullies; and she, a stout matron whose comparatively smooth face makes her look younger than her age. Sometimes they are seen staggering a bit, humming the remnants of a song, their muscles obviously savoring the memory of the final dance of a feast.<br>The custom is that men walk in front and women follow. But Bhonco and NoPetticoat walk side by side. Sometimes holding hands! A constant source of embarrassment to Xoliswa Ximiya: old people have no right to love. And if they happen to be foolish enough to harbor the slightest affection for each other, they must not display it in public.<br>&#x201c;Tears are close to my eyes, NoPetticoat,&#x201d; snivels the man of the house, dabbing his eyes with the handkerchief.<br>&#x201c;A big man like you shouldn&#x2019;t be bawling like a spoiled baby, Bhonco,&#x201d; says the woman of the house, nevertheless putting her arm around his shoulders.<br>A beautiful thing has happened. They have just received the news that Xoliswa Ximiya, their beloved and only child, has been promoted at work. She is now the principal of Qolorha-by-Sea Secondary School.<br>Xoliswa Ximiya is not called just Xoliswa. People use both her name and surname when they talk about her, because she is an important person in the community. A celebrity, so to speak. She is highly learned too, with a B.A. in education from the University of Fort Hare, and a certificate in teaching English as a second language from some college in America.<br>&#x201c;They will not accept her,&#x201d; laments NoPetticoat, as if to herself.<br>&#x201c;But she is a child of this community,&#x201d; says Bhonco adamantly. &#x201c;She grew up in front of their eyes. She became educated while others laughed and said I was mad to send a girl to school.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They will say she is a woman. Remember the teacher who left? He was a man, yet they didn&#x2019;t accept him. They made life very difficult for him. How much more for a woman?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They made life difficult for him because he was uncircumcised. He was not a man. How could he teach our children with a dangling foreskin?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I tell you, Bhonco, they won&#x2019;t accept her. They will give my baby problems at that school!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She is not a baby. She is thirty-six years old. And if they don&#x2019;t accept her it will be the work of the Believers. They are jealous because they don&#x2019;t have a daughter who is as educated,&#x201d; says Bhonco, making it clear that the discussion is terminated.<br>It had to come back to the war between the Believers and Unbelievers. They are in competition in everything.<br>The early manifestation of this competition happened a few years ago when the Ximiyas bought a pine dining table with four chairs. The family became the talk of the community, since no one else in the village had a dining table those days. But Zim, of the family of Believers, had to burst the Ximiya bubble by buying exactly the same dining table, but with six chairs. That really irked the son of Ximiya and his supporters.<br>Since then the war between the two families has become a public one. Their good neighbors await with bated breath the next skulduggery they will do against each other.<br>The Cult of the Unbelievers began with Twin-Twin, Bhonco Ximiya&#x2019;s ancestor, in the days of Prophetess Nongqawuse almost one hundred and fifty years ago. The revered Twin-Twin had elevated unbelieving to the heights of a religion. The cult died during the Middle Generations, for people then were more concerned with surviving and overcoming their oppression. They did not have the time to fight about the perils of belief and unbelief.<br>But even before the sufferings of the Middle Generations had passed&#x2014;when it was obvious to everyone that the end was near&#x2014;Bhonco, son of Ximiya, resurrected the cult.<br>He does not care that only his close relatives and himself subscribe to it. Nor does it matter to him that people have long forgotten the conflicts of generations ago. He holds to them dearly, for they have shaped his present, and the present of the nation. His role in life is to teach people not to believe. He tells them that even the Middle Generations wouldn&#x2019;t have suffered if it had not been for the scourge of belief.<br>Beautiful things are celebrated not only with tears. So Bhonco tells his wife that he will go to Vulindlela Trading Store to buy a tin of corned beef. NoPetticoat laughs and says he must not use the promotion of her baby as an excuse. He needs something salty because he had a lot to drink at the feast yesterday, and now he is nursing a hangover. Whoever heard of sorghum beer giving one a hangover? Bhonco wonders to himself.<br>&#x201c;While you are away I&#x2019;ll go to the hotel to see if they have work for me,&#x201d; says NoPetticoat as she adjusts her qhiya turban and puts a shawl over her shoulders. But her husband cannot hear her, for he has already walked out of their pink rondavel.<br>NoPetticoat supplements the income from her old-age pension&#x2014;or nkamnkam, as the people call it&#x2014;by working as a babysitter at the Blue Flamingo Hotel. Tourists often come to enjoy the serenity of this place, to admire birds and plants, or to go to the Valley of Nongqawuse to see where the miracles happened. They book in at the Blue Flamingo, and leave their children with part-time nannies while they walk or ride all over the valley, or swim in the rough sea.<br>NoPetticoat is occasionally called by the hotel management when there are babies to look after. However, when many days have passed without anyone calling her, she walks to the hotel to find out if there is any work. She has had to do that since she discovered that the managers call her only as a last resort. Their first choices are the young women whose bodies are still supple enough to make red-blooded male tourists salivate. Almost always when she goes without being called, she finds that indeed there are babies to look after, but a message has been sent to some shameless filly to come for the job. Invariably she fights her way and takes over.<br>Bhonco drags his gumboots up the hillock to the trading store. His brown overalls are almost threadbare at the elbows and at the knees. He wears a green woolen hat that the people call a skullcap. He does not carry a stick as men normally do.<br>Under his breath he curses the trader for building his store on the hill. But the breathtaking view from the top compensates for the arduous climb. Down below, on his right, he can see the wild sea smashing gigantic waves against the rocks, creating mountains of snow-white surf. On his left his eyes feast on the green valleys and the patches of villages with beautiful houses painted pink, powder blue, yellow, and white.<br>Most of the houses are rondavels. But over the years a new architectural style, the hexagon, has developed. On the roofs of these voguish hexagons, corrugated iron appears under the thatch, like a petticoat that is longer than the dress. This is both for aesthetic reasons and to stop the termites. But Bhonco does not believe in this newfangled fashion of building hexagons instead of the tried and tested rondavel.<br>From where he stands he can see the Gxarha River and the Intlambo-ka-Nongqawuse&#x2014;Nongqawuse&#x2019;s Valley. He can also see Nongqawuse&#x2019;s Pool and the great lagoon that is often covered by a thick blanket of mist.<br>Indeed, Qolorha-by-Sea is a place rich in wonders. The rivers do not cease flowing, even when the rest of the country knells a drought. The cattle are round and fat.<br>Bhonco was born in this village. He grew up in this village. Except for the time he worked in the cities, he has lived in this village all his life. Yet he is always moved to tears by its wistful beauty.<br>A gale of heat grazes his face. The wind always brings heat from the sea.<br>Vulindlela Trading Store is a big stone building with a red corrugated-iron roof crowned by...</p><h2>Wangari Maathai: The Woman Who Planted Millions of Trees</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Trees are living symbols of peace and hope.&#x201d; &#x2013;Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace laureate<br></b><br>This simply told story begins with Green Belt Movement founder Wangari Maathai&#x2019;s childhood at the foot of Mount Kenya where, as the oldest child in her family, her responsibility was to stay home and help her mother.

The number of dead surpassed the casualties of the Rosewood Massacre in Florida and rivaled those of the Tulsa Riots in Oklahoma, but the incident--one of the largest mass murders of blacks in American history--is now largely forgotten. Investigate the facts behind this harrowing act of genocide in E.R. Bills&#39;s compelling inquiry into the Slocum Massacre.</p><p><br>Born in Ft. Worth and raised in Aledo, <b>E. R. Bills</b> has a degree in journalism from Texas State University. He lives with his family in north Texas and does freelance historical, editorial and travel writing for publications around his home state. He is also the author of <i><strong>Texas Obscurities: Stories of the Peculiar, Exceptional and Nefarious</strong></i> (History Press, 2013)."Bills is a bold writer. . . He does not mince words. He has not only retold the story as a 'massacre,' and not a riot, but he has characterized the killings as 'an act of genocide.' Bills' description is precisely accurate of what happened in Slocum on July 29, 1910. .&nbsp;. Bills has retold a story that should be a "must read" for anyone willing to see the truth about genocide in America.<br><br>from a review entitled "The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas" (by L. Cravin) in <b><i>North Amarillo Now </i></b>(May 18, 2014). <br><br>"Bills' writing style is straightforward and engaging. He's obviously done his homework, and the book includes endnotes and sources. . . It's a good read, an astonishing record of man's inhumanity to man."<br><br>from a review entitled "Days of Shame" (by Margaret Allyson) in <b><i>Fort Worth Weekly</i></b> C05/28/14)<br><br>"As the United States and its people make some effort to come to terms with their racist past, they stand to benefit from those whose diligent research has homed in on incidents of racially motivated violence that have marred the republic's history. In the last two decades alone, professional historians, journalists, and other researchers have published dozens of titles treating lynching and race riots, and there seems to be no sign that the possibilities for investigation have been exhausted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelance journalist E. R. Bills contributes to this literature on racial violence with the study of the 1910 murders of an unknown and unknowable number of African Americans that began near the East Texas town of Slocum in southeastern Anderson County on the evening of July 29 and spilled over into Houston County to the south, where additional black residents (again the number of casualties is uncertain) were shot indiscriminately by white mobs. The author makes excellent use of contemporary local and state newspapers to piece together details of this massacre and to place the events in their appropriate historical context.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bills follows the lead of a number of students of racial violence who have sought to restore historical memory to communities where incidents of racial violence are seldom spoken about. His evidence leads him to challenge the official body count of seven or eight African American victims and to claim that perhaps hundreds were buried in unmarked mass graves, 'probably establishing the Slocum Massacre as the single, largest pogrom of blacks in modern American history,' exceeding the casualty rate of the more well-known Tulsa, Oklahoma riots of 1921 and the Rosewood, Florida, massacre of 1923. Following a wide-ranging, sometimes speculative analysis of the precipitating events leading up to the massacre, Bills concludes, 'Regardless of the impetus, what followed was an act of genocide that went unprosecuted, unpunished and unresolved and remains so to this day.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the final analysis, however, Bills is less concerned with historical memory than he is with historical amnesia. His frustration leaps from the pages of this brief and occasionally repetitive volume as he describes a deceitful official of the Houston County Historical Commission who ignored requests to erect a permanent marker in memory of the incident; indifferent Texas politicians who 'acknowledged' the episode in 2011 with the passage of House Resolution 865 but who, according to the author, should have instead appointed an investigating committee to research the event thoroughly; and the officials of the Museum of East Texas Culture who have provided space for African American exhibits absent any mention of the Slocum Massacre and who appear, according to Bills, much more interested in the 2013 opening of the Confederate Veterans' Memorial Park in downtown Palestine, Texas. For Bills, substantive efforts toward racial reconciliation in post-James Byrd Texas, similar to the proactive steps taken in the past decade in Rosewood and Tulsa, mark the only hope for Texans, southerners and all Americans to remedy the ongoing racial tensions that confront the United States. This volume, accessible to both scholarly and general audiences interested in the history of racial violence, African American history, and Texas history, seeks to assist in that ambitions goal."<br> James M.

How is that moment aboard a Navy ship as it barrels toward the Normandy shore related to the death of an old man in an Appalachian nursing home seventy-two years later?</p><br><p>Bell Elkins, prosecuting attorney in Acker&#x2019;s Gap, West Virginia, is asked by an old acquaintance to look into the death of her beloved father in an Alzheimer&#x2019;s care facility.

Here and there, gaslight gleamed, flashing will-o'-the-wisp in the shrouding pea soup mist. It was the perfect night not to be seen.</p> <p>Will Carver loped across rooftops and gables, leaping across an alley and coming to a halt behind a chimney near Brickbank.</p> <p>A man landed lightly on the tiles beside him, breathing hard from the exertion. He wore black leather from head to toe, and the only weapons he carried were a pair of razors, tucked in his belt. "Bloody 'ell. You tryin' to run me to death?" Blade muttered.</p> <p>The words were quiet, but the sound carried in the still night. Will's lip curled, and he glared at his master.</p> <p>"They won't be listenin' for us, bucko." Blade straightened, staring at the ruddy pillar of smoke ahead of them. "Not with that burnin'. And none of 'em 'as your hearin'."</p> <p>A column of red glowed against the night sky ahead, barely muted by the fog. Every time Will breathed he could taste the ash in the air. Ahead, a massive brick gate and wall blocked the way into the city. A company of metaljackets paced in front of the gate, gaslight gleaming off the shining steel plates of their armored chests. With the flamethrower appendages in place of their left arms they looked formidable enough to keep the general rabble at bay. They were, however, automatons and not human.</p> <p>He'd long since learned they didn't look up.</p> <p>"Over?" he asked.</p> <p>"I got me pardon now," Blade said. "Could waltz right on through them gates and they'd not say a word." The devilish light in his eyes said he wanted to try. There was nothing Blade liked better than thumbing his nose at the blue bloods who ruled the city.</p> <p>"Yeah, well, we ain't all that lucky," Will reminded him. "I've still got a price on me head."</p> <p>Blade sighed, eyeing the massive edifice. "Over it is, then."</p> <p>"You're gettin' lazy."</p> <p>"I should be at 'ome, tucked up with me cheroot and a nice glass of mulled blud-wein." What he didn't add was the fact that he most likely wouldn't have been doing either of those things. If the fire hadn't called them out, Blade'd be in bed with his wife, Honoria.</p> <p>Will took a few steps back. No point him being at home. The flat he rented these days was cold and uninviting. There was nothing for him to go back to.</p> <p>A wide leap took him sailing across the street and onto a rooftop beside the gate. Taking a running start, he bounded up and over the wall before the guard on top had finished shaking out the flame on his match. Human eyes were sometimes just as bad as the automatons.</p> <p>Bootsteps echoed him on the rooftops as he flitted lightly through the night. Fog parted around him, drifting in his wake, but he was moving too fast for anyone watching to see.</p> <p>Here in the city the streets were a touch wider, the buildings not as jammed together as they were in the Whitechapel rookery he called home. Blood flushed through his veins as he leaped from rooftop to rooftop. He'd been cooped up for too long; he needed this.</p> <p>Screams caught his ear along with the organized shouts of people trying to marshal water pumps. Little snowflakes of ash floated through the air, almost thick enough to choke a man. Will paused in the crook of a chimney.</p> <p>Ahead, the world looked like it was on fire. Billowing gouts of orange flame licked at the skies, and a thick dark pall of smoke hung over the river. Lines of people manned water pumps, desperately trying to stop the flames from spreading.</p> <p>"Jaysus," Blade cursed as he knelt at Will's side.</p> <p>"The draining factories," Will said. "Someone's fired the draining factories."</p> <p>It was unthinkable. The line of factories down by the river were owned by the ruling Echelon to filter and store the blood gathered in the blood taxes. This would be a huge blow to them.</p> <p>Blade's eyes narrowed. "You and I ought to get out of 'ere, quick-smart." His nostrils flared. "The place'll be swarmin' in metaljackets before we know it."</p> <p>Will backed up a step. He knew what Blade wasn't saying. Two more perfect scapegoats couldn't be found. Most of the aristocratic Echelon had been furious with the queen's pardon and knighthood of Blade three years ago. And Will was just a slave-without-a-collar to their eyes.</p> <p>A clink of metal caught his ears. Iron-booted feet on distant cobbles. A legion of metaljackets by the sound of it. "Go," he snapped, shoving Blade in the back.</p> <p>Blade needed no urging. He scrambled up the tiles on the roof, a break in the clouds bathing him in moonlight. Once, a few years ago, his hair would have lit up like a beacon. Now it had dulled to a light brown, and his skin was no longer as pale as marble.</p> <p>Will followed at his heels in an easy lope, his ears alert to the slightest sound behind them. They'd seen what they came to see. No doubt word of it'd be all over the streets by morning.</p> <p>Movement ahead caught his eye. A swirl of a black cloak stirring the fog. Will leaped forward and shoved Blade flat, covering him with his body.</p> <p>"Ooof," Blade wheezed. He lifted his head. "Thanks, but I've already got a wife-"</p> <p>"Shut up." Will pressed his hand between the other man's shoulder blades, coming to a crouch. His gaze raked the fog. There. A metallic chink. Voices in the shadows.</p> <p>From Blade's stillness, he'd heard them too.</p> <p>"Stay here," Will breathed, close to his ear. "Keep your bloody head down and I'll check it out."</p> <p>"Do I look like I need a friggin' nursemaid?"</p> <p>Will shot him a look. Three years ago, no. Blade'd been the most dangerous thing to stalk the night. But his hair and skin color weren't the only changes in him since he'd started drinking Honoria's blood.</p> <p>"You go left," he finally murmured. Short of tying Blade to the chimney with his belt, there wasn't much chance of leaving him here.</p> <p>Both of them faded into the fog. The voices ahead were getting farther away. Will moved like a wraith through the night, the movement rippling his dark wool coat around his hips. Beneath it he wore a heavy leather waistcoat that had been modified with steel inserts, as well as steel caps over his knees. You couldn't be too careful in a world where a man's main weapon might be a shiv or a heavy wrench. His loupe virus could heal almost anything, but being knifed still hurt.</p> <p>Metal clanged and a pair of curses littered the air. Then silence, as though both people froze to see if they'd been heard. Will slowed, creeping across the tiles with one foot placed carefully in front of the other. He knelt low, easing on hands and feet around the edge of a chimney. There was no sign of Blade, but then Blade was even better at this sort of thing than he was.</p> <p>"You drop that again and Mercury'll have your head," someone snapped.</p> <p>Two figures. Both dressed in black and moving with a footpad's efficiency. The shorter one picked up something heavy. A hollow metal tube, like the flamethrowers that the Spitfires used.</p> <p>"Mercury ain't here, is he?" asked the shorter man, hefting the flamethrower over his shoulder. "And when he hears how well we done, then he'll be burying us in ale and whores."</p> <p>"That's if the Echelon don't rip your guts out first," Blade said pleasantly, materializing out of nowhere.</p> <p>Shit.</p> <p>Will leaped forward, even as the two men turned on his master. Despite their bickering, they moved with military efficiency. The shorter one snapped the flamethrower up, just as the other drew his blade. The tube coughed and then bright orange flame spewed through the fog, highlighting the roof and everyone on it.</p> <p>Blade spun low, sweeping the knife-wielder's feet out from under him. Will grabbed the barrel of the flamethrower and elbowed the man in the face. There was a satisfying crunch, then his mind registered just how hot the tube was. He dropped it and it rolled toward the edge of the roof, catching in the gutter.</p> <p>"Just the two of you boys?" Blade taunted, not even bothering to draw a knife. He bent backward, avoiding the swipe of the knife with a gravity-defying movement, before snapping upright.</p> <p>The man he was facing stiffened. "Frigging bleeders!" He reached into his pocket to press something and then agony screamed through Will's head.</p> <p>The sound was like an ice pick to the brain, wiping out all sense of time and place and even connection to his body. He hit the tiles, scrabbling blindly for purchase as he started to slide.</p> <p>Something hit him hard under the chin, snapping his head back with resounding force. Words sounded, distorting the high-pitched scream, but he couldn't make any of them out. Then movement blurred at the edge of his vision. Another smashing blow against his cheekbone. Blood splashed over his face, wet and hot.</p> <p>Will clapped his hands over his ears, collapsing back on the tiles. That sound! Like razors in his head.</p> <p>In...his pocket. Something in the man's pocket. A device of sorts, making the noise.</p> <p>Grinding his teeth together, he saw the shorter man lifting the flamethrower high. No time to think. He kicked out, aiming for the man's knee.</p> <p>A heavy weight landed on him and they both grunted. The throbbing squeal of noise pounded in time to his heartbeat. Will clawed to his feet and staggered forward, searching for Blade.</p> <p>There. On the roof. The other man knelt over him and Will realized he had a knife buried deep in Blade's chest. Trying to cut out his heart.</p> <p>"No!" he roared, seeing red.</p> <p>Anger rushed over him, swallowing him whole and burning him in its wake. He grabbed the man by the collar and flung him away. Blade gasped, clapping a hand to the knife hilt, but his reactions were still slow, disorientated.</p> <p>The noise.</p> <p>Will slammed the man down and yanked at his pocket. A small, vibrating device came free. He crushed it in his fist and the world fell silent.</p> <p>Will staggered, throwing aside the crushed pieces. His ears were still ringing, but at least he could think. Breathe. Move.</p> <p>The scent of hot, coppery blood washed over him.</p> <p>"Blade," he growled, leaping over the gasping man on the roof and sliding to his knees beside his master.</p> <p>Blade lifted his head, then collapsed back down. "Bloody... Get it out...'s silver." He lifted his fingers and flinched as they brushed against the knife hilt.</p> <p>"Hold still," Will snapped. A cold ring of sweat beaded on his forehead. The knife was buried to the hilt. He had no idea of the damage it had done, or what would happen if he removed it.</p> <p>Behind him, the two men helped each other to their feet. Will spared them a glance, but they were trying to get away, now that the advantage had shifted once more to him and Blade.</p> <p>"Gutted by a human." Blade laughed incredulously. "Always thought...it'd be one of the Echelon. In the end."</p> <p>"Stop your whinin'." Will wrenched his shirt off, a frisson of icy cold trailing down his spine. Blue bloods were notoriously difficult to kill. That was one reason the French revolution had guillotined their aristocrats. The only other way to stop them was to cut out their heart or cause severe damage to it. He swallowed hard and shoved his shirt around the wound to stop the bleeding. "Nothin' more'n a scratch. We'll have you hale in no time."</p> <p>Blade met his gaze. His fingers were surprisingly strong when they closed around Will's. "Swear you'll look after 'er," he snarled. "If...if I don't..."</p> <p>Will dropped his gaze. "Aye. You know I'll do it." He owed Blade his life, no matter what he personally thought of Honoria. "Hold still. You need blood."</p> <p>Darkness slithered through Blade's pale eyes. His head rolled to the side. "Feels...numb..." he murmured.</p> <p>Panic speared through Will's gut. "Don't you dare!" Ripping at the heavy hunting knife he carried, he cradled his friend's head in his hands. "Here. Have me blood. It'll help."</p> <p>It was short work to slash the vein in his wrist open. He cupped the back of his head and held Blade's mouth to his wrist.</p> <p>A moment of hesitation that never used to be there. He knew what Blade was thinking. He'd stopped taking directly from any of his thrall's veins when Honoria came into his life. Now he drank his blood either from her or cold, out of the icebox.</p> <p>"Don't be a fool. She won't mind," Will snarled.</p> <p>That hint of darkness swept through Blade's irises again. Will's chest caught. Not in fear. Gods, not that. Anticipation swept through his veins, lighting them on fire. It'd been a long time since he'd been one of Blade's thralls. He'd not realized how much he missed it.</p> <p>As Blade's mouth closed over his wrist, his tongue sliding over the ragged wound, Will collapsed forward onto his hands. A gasp tore from his lips. Feeling flooded through him that he hadn't felt in years. It had confused him when Blade first took him as a thrall, but it was nothing more than his body's reaction to the chemicals in his master's saliva.</p> <p>But the moment of closeness...</p> <p>This was all he'd ever have of that.</p> <p>He ground his teeth and tried to deny the pull. Twice as harsh after three years of abstinence. And just as confusing.</p> <p>He didn't feel this way with females.</p> <p>Or he never had. Until Lena walked into his life.</p> <p>And I'm not thinkin' of her. Will bit his lip, trying to ignore the flush of pleasure that thought brought. Dark hair, dark eyes, that flirtatious little smile that drove him insane... His groin tightened and he growled, head bowed as the sensation against his wrist increased.</p> <p>It was over all too quickly. Will collapsed onto his backside, clutching his wrist against his chest. The skin throbbed, still feeling the imprint of Blade's mouth. Heat flushed through the ragged edges of the knife cut-his loupe virus, rapidly healing the wound. It would be gone by the end of the hour, barely a pink pucker against his swarthy skin.</p> <p>Blade gasped, drawing his feet up. His eyes blazed with black fire, and he grabbed the handle of the hilt and ground his teeth together. Crying out, he drew it out of his chest and collapsed back on the roof, panting for breath.</p> <p>The wound was still bleeding, but sluggishly now. With his blood flushing through Blade's system, there was a strong chance he'd pull through. Verwulfen blood was thrice as potent as a human's.</p> <p>"Honoria'll...kill me..." Blade gasped.</p> <p>That's if he survived. Will took one look at the ashen color of his face and looked away swiftly. Damage to the heart was always dangerous. He had to get him back to the warren, where Honoria, with her medical background, might be able to help.</p> <p>Rigging up a makeshift bandage, he held his coat in place to suppress the bleeding and then tied the ends of his shirt off. "There. That'll hold until we get you home." Sliding his arm under Blade's shoulder, he helped him to sit.</p> <p>Blade gasped, clutching at his chest. The sight tore another shaft of ice through Will's gut. Followed by a hot stab of anger. Three years ago Blade would've laughed this off. He was no longer standing on the edge of the Fade-when the craving virus finally overtook a blue blood and he turned into something else, something worse-but for a moment, Will didn't know if t...</p></p><h2>Vengeful</h2><p>The sequel to V.E.

She is centuries older than the Christian Virgin Mary, but not unconnected with her in that in most illustrations she holds a rosary, suggesting purification of the cycle of birth and death, and a willow branch, a symbol of Buddhist virtues. Kuan Yin&#39;s image can be found wherever there are Chinese or Japanese speaking people in the world - in homes, restaurants, workplaces, small urban temples, Buddhist, Taoist and Shinto shrines - and the ritual of consulting her has brought solace, hope and insight to countless people. It continues to be an integral part of the lives of tens of millions of people throughout the East today.

When this wise and humble man departed from life, he left author Og Mandino a precious legacy: the distilled wisdom of his unique collection of the greatest books about self-motivation and success--books he called "hand of God" books because they seemed to have been written with God's hand guiding the author's own.<br><br>In this tender and inspiring book, Og shares with his millions of readers his old friend's bequest. It is nothing less than a blueprint for success, telling us in plain language exactly what we must do to mount the seven rungs of life's ladder--from material achievement and worldly success to the highest spiritual development. Whatever your most cherished dream may be, Og and his good angel Simon will show you the way to bring it within reach.</p><p>Og Mandino was a man who not only practiced what he preached but also inspired millions to follow his example of successful, fruitful living.

The Greatest Mystery in the World is Og Mandino&#39;s final book.Memories. I can still hear his gentle but deep voice saying the words as if they had been spoken just this morning instead of so very long ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How our earth was created and hangs suspended in space or how our minds and bodies repeatedly perform their daily miraculous functions is most difficult to comprehend but the greatest mystery still confronting mankind is that despite all the tools that God provided, both mental and physical, so much of humanity continues to stumble along the rocky paths of failure and sorrow, poverty, and despair.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> More than twenty years have passed since I first heard that wise declaration and yet I am certain that the sentence, despite its length, is being quoted to you verbatim. It was spoken by a wise old man, Simon Potter, whom I first met one snowy morning in the parking lot behind the building in north Chicago that housed the magazine I headed, Success Unlimited. He was feeding pigeons from a large brown paper bag as I slowly pulled into the lot and our initial brief greeting that morning was the beginning of a relationship that has affected my entire life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Following that first meeting, in the mid-seventies, Simon and I soon became close friends. Very often, after a long and pressure-packed day of trying to run a national publication, with all of its challenges, I would walk wearily through the dingy parking lot, enter the old stone building across the street, climb the stairway to his second-story apartment, number 21, and visit with the old man before the long drive to my suburban home. His wise advice and counsel, always served with a glass of white sherry, often helped me to relax and see my problems in a more rational light, and I&#x2019;m certain that his loving thoughts and wisdom have often been reflected in my work and how I&#x2019;ve tried to deal with the world since those memorable days, long ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon&#x2019;s tiny three-room apartment, clean and dust-free, had one distinguishing feature. Books! Books everywhere, not only crammed into several huge wooden bookcases but also piled tall and neat in columns against every available wall. The old gentleman proudly explained that they were his lifetime collection of &#x201c;hand of God&#x201d; books and in response to my puzzled expression he said that he truly believed that certain books were written with God&#x2019;s hand resting lightly upon the author&#x2019;s so that the words inscribed on paper or parchment were being presented directly to us containing God&#x2019;s principles, guidelines, and wise advice on how to lead a better life.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am six feet tall but Simon was at least a head taller and although he was seventy-eight years old he also told me he was still a working man&nbsp;...&nbsp;self-employed as a &#x201c;human ragpicker.&#x201d; He said that he spent most of his days and nights searching out people who had made a failure of their lives and found themselves on humanity&#x2019;s junk pile of misery and despair. Whenever he discovered such lost souls, and they were everywhere, he exclaimed, he would use his &#x201c;hand of God&#x201d; books to teach them how to regain their hope and self-esteem.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Simon learned that I was not only an editor but had been fortunate enough to publish several books including a bestseller, The Greatest Salesman in the World, he told me that he had been working for years on writing a simple piece which contained short but powerful rules of life necessary for one&#x2019;s success. He admitted that he had used many of his &#x201c;hand of God&#x201d; books as his reference source and so he had been considering calling his finished work &#x201c;A Memorandum from God.&#x201d; He even dropped hints, during several of my visits, that perhaps I might consider using his small piece in one of my future books so that it would be read by far greater numbers than he could ever possibly reach.<br> &nbsp;<br> As our friendship strengthened during the summer and fall of 1974, Simon began addressing me as &#x201c;Mister Og.&#x201d; In long discussions, where I did far more listening than talking, we covered a wide range of subjects from the benefits of good self-help books to the sorry state of our world. It was, by far, the most memorable time of my life and yet, for reasons I still do not understand, I never mentioned my relationship with Simon to anyone at the office nor did I ever say anything to my wife, Bette, about this giant who was gradually teaching me how to live a more fulfilling life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, on a Monday morning I shall never forget, my world suddenly shifted. I had been away from the magazine for several weeks, promoting The Greatest Salesman in the World on a nationwide tour, and I arrived at my office very early in order to tackle the expected backlog of challenges. On my desk was a large brown envelope, addressed to me, with its postage stamps still uncanceled. Upon reading the words &#x201c;from an old ragpicker&#x201d; in the upper left-hand corner, I immediately dropped the package and raced out of the office. When I reached the parking lot I dashed between cars, crossed the street, and entered Simon&#x2019;s old apartment building. I hurried up the stairs, ran down the hallway to his apartment, and began pounding on his door. Finally it was opened by a plump woman in a dingy robe with a small child in her arms. When I asked for Simon Potter she began closing the door. She said she didn&#x2019;t know any Simon Potter and in the four years she had lived in the apartment she had never seen the man I described to her.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t know what to say or think. Finally she slammed the door in my face and I retreated slowly down the stairs. In the lobby I turned to a downward stairway and, luckily, found the building&#x2019;s janitor sitting next to the furnace reading a newspaper. He said he had worked there for eleven years and had never seen anyone answering to my description of Simon. In the next several hours of anguish I checked with the police station on Foster Avenue, Cook County Hospital, Missing Persons, and even the county morgue on West Polk. None had any record of a person fitting Simon&#x2019;s description. With a heavy pain in my chest I finally returned to my office and closed the door. I slowly opened the large brown envelope and read Simon&#x2019;s message to me. Enclosed, he wrote, was &#x201c;The God Memorandum.&#x201d; He asked that I apply its wisdom to my own life for a hundred days and if it worked for me perhaps I might consider sharing it with the world in one of my books. I was not to worry about him. He was embarking on a special mission and although we would not see each other for a long time he wanted me to know that he loved me and would pray for me. I sat staring down at my hands for the longest time after finishing his letter. Then I picked up &#x201c;The God Memorandum&#x201d; and read it slowly. It was everything I expected and more and, like Simon&#x2019;s spoken words to me, it became a map by which I have tried to navigate my life, even to this day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not until several months after Simon&#x2019;s mysterious disappearance did I finally tell everything to Bette one evening as we were preparing for bed. She sat close to me, on my side of the bed, and listened intently for more than an hour, without interrupting, as I related all I could remember about my experiences with the old ragpicker.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally she grasped my hand firmly and asked, &#x201c;In your search for him, did anyone&nbsp;...&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;...&nbsp;admit to ever seeing this man? Anyone in your office? Anyone in the neighborhood?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shook my head. &#x201c;No one. It&#x2019;s as if he never existed except for me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bette kissed my cheek, rose, walked around me, and removed an old dictionary from the bookcase against the wall. She turned several pages before pausing and looking toward me before she began reading, &#x201c;Angel&nbsp;...&nbsp;a spiritual being superior to man in power and intelligence&nbsp;...&nbsp;an attendant and messenger of God&nbsp;...&nbsp;any representative of God, as a prophet or teacher.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She replaced the book, walked slowly around to her side of the bed, pulled back the covers and said softly, &#x201c;Good night, darling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In my next book, The Greatest Miracle in the World, I told the Simon Potter story completely and, of course, shared &#x201c;The God Memorandum&#x201d; with my readers. I am so proud that the book has been in print, now, for more than twenty years and is used by hundreds of alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs around the world as its total sales approach five million copies in fifteen languages! Simon, it seems, is still rescuing humans from lives of grief and failure through his words and I am proud to have been his messenger, in a small way.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>50 Walks in Cotswolds</h2><p>These books feature all the practical detail you need, accompanied by fascinating background reading on the history and wildlife of the area, and clear mapping for ease of use.

It describes some important areas of American aviation weapons maturation under the pressure of war with emphasis on advanced technology and experimental aircraft configurations. The great value of the work is illumination of little known or minimally documented projects that significantly advanced the science of aeronautics, propulsion, aircraft systems, and ordnance, but did not go into production. Each chapter introduces another topic by examining the state-of-the-art at the beginning of the war, advantages pursued, and results achieved during the conflict. This last is the vehicle to examine the secret modifications or experiments that are little known. Consequently, this is an important single-source for a fascinating and diverse collection of wartime efforts never before brought together under a single cover. The &#x201c;war stories&#x201d; are those of military staffs, engineering teams, and test pilots struggling against short schedules and tight resource constraints to push the bounds of technology. These epic and sometimes life-threatening endeavors were as vital as actual combat operations.</p><p>William J.

A classically trained anthropologist, she answers questions we all have about our pets' behavior. Do dogs have different barks that mean different things? What makes a dog difficult to house-train? Why do certain dogs and cats get along so well? How does Snoopy recognize people he sees only once a year, while Misty barks at strangers she sees every day? <br> <i>The Social Lives of Dogs</i> presents marvelous evidence of the power of the group -- and shows us that those who are fortunate enough to be given the trust of an honorable dog will also have their lives enriched.</p><p>Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, who has written evocatively on the ways of dogs (<i>The Hidden Life of Dogs</i>) and cats (<i>The Tribe of the Tiger</i>) at large, here turns her attention to the particular canines--and other animals--with which she shares her home.<p> Marshall's narrative begins with the arrival of an unfortunate, highly intelligent creature named Sundog, who, excluded from the somewhat constricted worlds of her older dogs, is forced to take his place in the next available pack--that of Marshall and the other human inhabitants of her New Hampshire home. "Perhaps we were not his first choice, but he took us," Marshall writes of Sundog learning his proper place in their order and they in his. Much as domestic dogs enjoy each other's company, Marshall hazards, when in the presence of humans each becomes a competitor for attention and food. Humans, in that world of small rivalries, become not so much alphas or pack leaders--as so many books have it--as they do "sources of life," providers of food and security. Such power can corrupt, of course, and at points Marshall observes that popular methods of dog training--or dog control--can do more harm than good, at least as far as a dog's emotional well-being is concerned.</p><p> Through her tales of Sundog, Misty, and her other dogs (and cats, and parrots), Marshall explores how fulfilling a life among animals can be. A little softer on the scientific explanations that drive her other books, Marshall's narrative shares the anecdotal richness of her earlier work. Any human who is curious about how dogs think and how the worlds of dogs and people intersect will find much of value in her pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Elizabeth Marshall Thomas</b> is also the author of <i>The Harmless People, Warrior Herdsmen,</i> and the novels <i>Certain Poor Shepherds, Reindeer Moon,</i> and <i>The Animal Wife.</i></p><h2>Feeling Wisdom: Working with Emotions Using Buddhist Teachings and Western Psychology</h2><p><b>A psychologist and longtime practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism shows how emotions relate to spiritual practice--that our feeling life is truly at the heart of our awakening.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realm of emotion is one of those areas where Buddhism and Western psychology are often thought to be at odds: Are emotions to be valued, examined, worked with as signs leading us to deeper self-knowledge? Or are they something to be ignored and avoided as soon as we recognize them? Rob Preece feels that neither of those extremes is correct. He charts a path through the emotions as they relate to Buddhist practice, showing that though emotions are indeed "skandhas" (elements that make up the illusory self) according to the Buddhist teaching, there is a good deal to be learned from these skandhas, and paying attention to their content contributes not only to psychological health but to deep insight into the nature of reality. He draws on his own experiences with emotions and meditation, through both his training in Tibetan Buddhism and psychotherapy, to show how working with emotions can be a complement to meditation practice.</p><p>ROB PREECE is a contemplative psychotherapist who&#39;s been practicing analysis for twenty years and Buddhism for around thirty. His work focuses on the interface between Buddhism and transpersonal psychology. A former faculty member of Sharpham College, he spent 1980 through 1985 on retreat in the Himalayas, and he&#39;s also an accomplished thangka painter. He leads meditation retreats and workshops that compare Jungian and Buddhist views of psychology. He has published four previous books with Snow Lion."Our emotional life can be a prison of suffering or a portal to profound heart-wisdom. In this brilliant synthesis of Tibetan Buddhist teachings and Western psychology, Rob Preece offers a rich guide for healing and spiritual awakening."&#x2014;Tara Brach, PhD, author of <i>Radical Acceptance</i> and <i>True Refuge<br><br></i>"On the path to greater freedom and wisdom, psychotherapy typically encourages us to get to know our feelings, even to follow them into stories of meaning and action.&nbsp; Buddhism, on the other hand, tends to encourage us to temper or ignore our feelings as a means to liberation from suffering. Rob Preece guides us in a tremendously useful and practical dialogue between these two disciplines."&#x2014;Polly Young-Eisendrath, PhD, author of <i>The Resilient Spirit</i> and <i>The Present Heart: A Memoir of Love, Loss</i> <i>and Discovery<br><br></i>"This book shows us very clearly how feelings can be a path to enlightenment and how wounds can turn into resources.

She's determined to no longer be a foster kid. Before long she's devised an elaborate scheme to get her real mother to come rescue her. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work out quite as she hoped it would...</p></p><p>Gilly Hopkins is a determined-to-be-unpleasant 11-year-old foster kid who the reader can't help but like by the end. Gilly has been in the foster system all her life, and she dreams of getting back to her (as she imagines) wonderful mother. (The mother makes these longings worse by writing the occasional letter.) Gilly is all the more determined to leave after she's placed in a new foster home with a "gross guardian and a freaky kid." But she soon learns about illusions--the hard way. This Newbery Honor Book manages to treat a somewhat grim, and definitely grown-up theme with love and humor, making it a terrific read for a young reader who's ready to learn that "happy" and "ending" don't always go together.

Or for that matter, the freaky seven-year-old boy and the shrunken blind black man who are also considered part of the bizarre "family"? Even cool Miss Harris, her teacher, is a shock to her.</p><p>Gutsy Gilly is both poignant and comic as, behind her best barracuda smile, she schemes against them and everyone else who tries to be friendly.

The road was closed, seemingly for good, and the 80,000 cars that traveled it each day had to find a new way to their destinations. It ought to have produced traffic chaos, but it didn't. The cars simply vanished. It was a moment of revelation: the highway had induced the demand for car travel. It was a classic case of build it and they will come,&#x201d; but for the first time the opposite had been shown to be true: knock it down and they will go away. Samuel I. Schwartz was inspired by the lesson. He started to reimagine cities, most of all his beloved New York, freed from their obligation to cars. Eventually, he found, he was not alone.<br><br>Since the turn of the twenty-first century, a surreptitious revolution has taken place: every year Americans are driving fewer miles. And the generation named for this new century the Millennials are driving least of all. Not because they can't afford to; they don't want to. They have better ideas for how to use their streets. An urban transformation is underway, and smart streets are at the heart of it. They will boost property prices and personal fitness, roll back years of congestion and smog, and offer a transformative experience of American urban life. From San Francisco to Salt Lake, Charleston to Houston, the American city is becoming a better and better place to be. Schwartz's <i>Street Smart</i> is a dazzling and affectionate history of the struggle for control of American cities, and an inspiring off-road map to a more vibrant, active, and vigorous urban future.</p><p><b>Sam Schwartz</b>, a.k.a.

Now in this memoir he describes what drove him and how he worked as an independent outsider, even at the nation's most prestigious publications. He tells the stories behind the stories<b>&#x2014;</b>riveting in their own right<b>&#x2014;</b>as he chases leads, cultivates sources, and grapples with the weight of what he uncovers, daring to challenge official narratives handed down from the powers that be. In telling these stories, Hersh divulges previously unreported information about some of his biggest scoops, including the My Lai massacre and the horrors at Abu Ghraib. There are also illuminating recollections of some of the giants of American politics and journalism: Ben Bradlee, A. M. Rosenthal, David Remnick, and Henry Kissinger among them. This is essential reading on the power of the printed word at a time when good journalism is under fire as never before.</p><p>SEYMOUR M.

He lives in Washington, D.C.<b>Introduction </b><br><br>I am a survivor from the golden age of journalism, when reporters for daily newspapers did not have to compete with the twenty-four-hour cable news cycle, when newspapers were flush with cash from display advertisements and want ads, and when I was free to travel anywhere, anytime, for any reason, with company credit cards. There was sufficient time for reporting on a breaking news story without having to constantly relay what was being learned on the newspaper&#x2019;s web page. <br><br> There were no televised panels of &#x201c;experts&#x201d; and journalists on cable TV who began every answer to every question with the two deadliest words in the media world&#x2014;&#x201c;I think.&#x201d; We are sodden with fake news, hyped-up and incomplete information, and false assertions delivered nonstop by our daily newspapers, our televisions, our online news agencies, our social media, and our President. <br><br> Yes, it&#x2019;s a mess. And there is no magic bullet, no savior in sight for the serious media. The mainstream newspapers, magazines, and television networks will continue to lay off reporters, reduce staff, and squeeze the funds available for good reporting, and especially for investigative reporting, with its high cost, unpredictable results, and its capacity for angering readers and attracting expensive lawsuits. The newspapers of today far too often rush into print with stories that are essentially little more than tips, or hints of something toxic or criminal. For lack of time, money, or skilled staff, we are besieged with &#x201c;he said, she said&#x201d; stories in which the reporter is little more than a parrot. I always thought it was a newspaper&#x2019;s mission to search out the truth and not merely to report on the dispute. Was there a war crime? The newspapers now rely on a negotiated United Nations report that comes, at best, months later to tell us. And have the media made any significant effort to explain why a UN report is not considered to be the last word by many throughout the world? Is there much critical reporting at all about the UN? Do I dare ask about the war in Yemen? Or why Donald Trump took Sudan off his travel ban list? (The leadership in Khartoum sent troops to fight in Yemen on behalf of Saudi Arabia.) <br><br> My career has been all about the importance of telling important and unwanted truths and making America a more knowledgeable place. I was not alone in making a difference; think of David Halberstam, Charley Mohr, Ward Just, Neil Sheehan, Morley Safer, and dozens of other first-rate journalists who did so much to enlighten us about the seamy side of the Vietnam War. I know it would not be possible for me to be as freewheeling in today&#x2019;s newspaper world as it was until a decade ago, when the money crunch began. I vividly remember the day when David Remnick, the editor of <i>The New Yorker, </i>called in 2011 to ask if I could do an interview with an important source by telephone rather than fly three thousand miles to do one in person. David, who did everything possible to support my reporting on the Abu Ghraib prison horror in 2004&#x2014;he paid dearly to enable me to publish reporting pieces in three consecutive issues&#x2014;made his plea to me in what I thought was a pained, embarrassed voice, almost a whisper. <br><br> Where are the tough stories today about America&#x2019;s continuing Special Forces operations and the never-ending political divide in the Middle East, Central America, and Africa? Abuses surely continue&#x2014; war is always hell&#x2014;but today&#x2019;s newspapers and networks simply cannot afford to keep correspondents in the field, and those that do&#x2014; essentially <i>The New York Times, </i>where I worked happily for eight years in the 1970s, constantly making trouble&#x2014;are not able to finance the long-term reporting that is needed to get deeply into the corruption of the military or intelligence world. As you will read herein, I spent two years before I was able to learn what I needed to report on the CIA&#x2019;s illegal domestic spying in the 1960s and 1970s. <br><br> I do not pretend to have an answer to the problems of our media today. Should the federal government underwrite the media, as England does with the BBC? Ask Donald Trump about that. Should there be a few national newspapers financed by the public? If so, who would be eligible to buy shares in the venture? This is clearly the time to renew the debate on how to go forward. I had believed for years that all would work out, that the failing American newspapers would be supplanted by blogs, online news collectives, and weekly newspapers that would fill in the blanks on local reporting as well as on international and national news, but, despite a few successes&#x2014;VICE, BuzzFeed, Politico, and Truthout come to mind&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t happening; as a result, the media, like the nation, are more partisan and strident. <br><br> So, consider this memoir for what it is: an account of a guy who came from the Midwest, began his career as a copyboy for a small agency that covered crime, fires, and the courts there, and eleven years later, as a freelance reporter in Washington working for a small antiwar news agency, was sticking two fingers in the eye of a sitting president by telling about a horrific American massacre, and being rewarded for it. You do not have to tell me about the wonder, and the potential, of America. Perhaps that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s very painful to think I might not have accomplished what I did if I were at work in the chaotic and unstructured journalism world of today. <br><br> Of course I&#x2019;m still trying.</p><h2>Up from Eden: A Transpersonal View of Human Evolution</h2><p>This book chronicles humanity&#39;s cultural and psychospiritual evolutionary journey over some six million years from its primal past into its dazzling cosmic future.</p><p></p><h2>Song of Leira (Volume 3) (The Songkeeper Chronicles)</h2><p><b>The Song bids her rise to battle.</b><b></b><br>Reeling from her disastrous foray into the Pit, Birdie, the young Songkeeper, retreats into the mountains.

Scion of a merchant dynasty, Miss Austin was intended to be launched upon the Echelon, where she just might be fortunate enough to be taken in as a thrall. The girl was certainly pretty enough to catch the eye of one of the seven dukes who ruled the council, or perhaps one of the numerous lesser Houses. Her family would be gifted with exclusive trade agreements and possibly sponsorship, and Miss Austin would live out the terms of her contract in the extravagant style the Echelon was acclimatized to. The type of style Honoria had once lived on the edges of. Before her father was murdered.</p> <p>Church Street opened into Butcher Square. On a kinder day the square would be packed with vendors and thronging with people. Today only the grim metal lions that guarded the entrance to the Museum of Bio-Mechanic History kept watch. The city wall loomed ahead, with the gaping maw of Ratcatcher Gate offering a glimpse of Whitechapel beyond. Fifty years ago the residents of Whitechapel had built the wall with whatever they could lay their hands on. It stood nearly twenty feet high, but its symbolism towered over the cold, misty square. Whitechapel had its own rules, its own rulers. The aristocratic Echelon could own London city, but they'd best steer clear of the rookeries.</p> <p>If Mr. Macy found out Honoria's address, he'd fire her on the spot. Her only source of a respectable livelihood would vanish, and she'd be facing those damned options again. She'd wasted a shilling tonight on a steam cab, just to keep the illusion of her circumstances intact. Mr. Macy had walked her out before locking up the studio where he taught young ladies to improve themselves. Usually he stayed behind and she could slip into the masses of foot traffic in Clerkenwell, turn a corner, and then double back for the long walk home. Tonight his chivalry had cost her a loaf of bread.</p> <p>She'd disembarked two streets away, prompting the cab driver to shake his head and mutter something beneath his breath. She felt like shaking her head too. A shilling for the sleight-of-hand that kept her employed. It didn't matter that that shilling would keep her with a roof over her head and food on the table for months to come. She still felt its loss keenly. Her stockings needed darning again and they hadn't the thread for it; her younger sister, Lena, had put her fingers through her gloves; and fourteen-year-old Charlie...Her breath caught. Charlie needed more than the pair of them combined.</p> <p>"'Ey!" a voice called. "'Ey, you!"</p> <p>Honoria's hand strayed to the pistol in her pocket and she glanced over her shoulder. A few months ago she might have jumped skittishly at the cry, but she'd spotted the ragged urchin out of the corner of her eye as soon as she started toward Ratcatcher Gate. The pistol was a heavy, welcoming weight in her grip. Her father's pistol was one of the few things she had left of him and probably the most precious for its sheer practicality. She'd long ago given up on sentimentality.</p> <p>"Yes?" she asked. The square was abandoned, but she knew there'd be eyes watching them from the heavily boarded windows that lined it.</p> <p>The urchin peered at her from flat, muddy-brown eyes. It could have been any age or sex with the amount of dirt it wore. She decided the square jaw was strong enough to name it a boy. Not even the constant rain could wash away the dirt on his face, as though it were as deeply ingrained in the child's pores as it was in the cobblestones beneath their feet.</p> <p>"Spare a shillin', m'um?" he asked, glancing around as though prepared to flee.</p> <p>Honoria's eyes narrowed and she gave the urchin another steady look. If she wasn't mistaken, that was a rather fine herringbone stitch riddled with grime at the edge of the child's coat. The clothing fit altogether too well for it to have been stolen, and it was draped in such a manner that it made the child look rather more malnourished than she suspected he was.</p> <p>She took her time drawing her slim change purse out and opening it. A handful of grimy shillings bounced pitifully in the bottom of it. Plucking one out with reluctance, she offered it to the little street rogue.</p> <p>The urchin reached for the coin and Honoria grabbed his hand. A quick twist revealed the inside of the child's wrist-and the crossed daggers tattooed there.</p> <p>His wary mud-brown eyes widened and he tried to yank his hand away. "Leggo!"</p> <p>Honoria snatched her shilling back and released him. The boy staggered, landing with a splash in a puddle. He swore under his breath and rolled to his feet.</p> <p>"I've more need of it than you," she told him, then swept her cloak to the side to reveal the butt of the pistol in her skirt pocket. "Run back to your master and tell him to give you a coin."</p> <p>The boy's lip curled and he glanced over his shoulder. "Worf a try. Already bin paid for this." He flipped a shilling out of nowhere and then pocketed it just as swiftly. A stealthy smile flashed over his face, gone just as quickly as the coin. "'Imself wants a word with you."</p> <p>"Himself?" For a moment she was blank. Then her gaze shot to the child's wrist and that damning tattoo of ownership. She tucked her change purse away and tugged her cloak about her chin. "I'm afraid I'm not at liberty this evening." Somehow she forced the words out, cool and clipped. Her fingers started to shake. She thrust them into fists. "My brother is not well. And I'm late. I must see to him."</p> <p>She took a step, then shied away as a hand caught at her cloak. "Don't. Touch. Me."</p> <p>The boy shrugged. "I'm jus' the messenger, luv. And trust me, you ain't wantin' 'im to send one o' the others."</p> <p>Her mouth went dry. In the ensuing silence, she felt as though her heartbeat had suddenly erupted into a tribal rhythm. Six months scratching a living on the edges of the rookery, trying to stay beneath the notice of the master. All for nothing. He'd been aware of her, probably all along.</p> <p>She had to see what he wanted. She'd caught a glimpse of the others who were part of his gang. Everybody in the streets gave them a large berth, like rats fleeing from a pack of prowling toms. Either she could go of her own volition, or she could be dragged there.</p> <p>"Let me tell my sister where I'm going," she finally said. "She'll be worried."</p> <p>"Your neck," the urchin said with a shrug. "Not mine."</p> <p>Honoria stared at him for a moment, then turned toward Ratcatcher Gate. Its heavy stone arch cast a shadow of cold over her that seemed to run down her spine. Himself. Blade. The man who ruled the rookeries. Or creature, she thought with a nervous shiver. There was nothing human about him.</p> <p>***</p> <p>By the time Honoria found Crowe Lane, she was drenched and her cotton skirts clung to her. The rain had finally let up, but the hour's walk had done its damage. Though little more than a fine mist, the rain had managed to seep through to her skin, leaving her flesh pebbled with cold and her corset tight and constrictive about her ribs. Or perhaps it was the thought of what was ahead causing her shortness of breath.</p> <p>Before heading out, she'd made herself snatch a mouthful of the fried cod that Lena had burned again. It sat in her stomach like a greasy weight, but she hadn't eaten for a good eight hours and her knees needed the strength. At barely seventeen, Lena had no innate skill at cookery, but she was often home earlier than Honoria, her shift at the clockmaker's finished well before dusk started to settle. They'd had their usual strained argument over nothing at all-and everything-before Charlie's cough had broken the tension. Lena had hurried in to take him his supper and try to get him to eat something, an ordeal Honoria didn't envy her. But, then, her sister wouldn't envy Honoria's task either if she'd known about it. Honoria had slipped out of the door before Lena could ask, not even bothering to change her clothes.</p> <p>A thick yellow fog was beginning to settle over the rookery. There were no gas lamps here, and she had no flare stick to light the way. At a sovereign apiece, she couldn't afford one.</p> <p>Footsteps scuttled in the shadows, but the fog carried every sound, and they might have been next to her or fifty feet away. She wasn't concerned. This close to the master's lair, nobody would dare attack her without his leave. For a moment she felt strangely fearless, her booted heels striking the cobbles with a ringing sound. She'd been afraid for so long: afraid of starving to death, afraid the Echelon would find them and drag her brother and sister away, afraid of being attacked in the streets by one of the Slasher gangs-those who drained a person of their blood to sell to the factories down by the wharves. It had worn her out with its familiarity, worn her down. She'd thought she had little fear left.</p> <p>And yet that familiar hollow feeling pooled in her stomach as she paused in front of the derelict building. The fog eddied away from the roughened brick walls as though something kept it out. A pair of crossed daggers was carved into the wooden sign that hung over the door, the sign that all the Reapers gang wore, proclaiming which gang they ran with.</p> <p>The Roman denarius that hung around her neck suddenly felt heavy. She knew the words inscribed on it as if they were engraved on her soul: fortes fortuna juvat. The motto her father had taken for himself when his experiments caught the eye of the duke of Caine, catapulting them into the gleaming world of the great Houses and earning them untold patronage.</p> <p>"Fortune favors the bold," she whispered under her breath. Then she raised her fist and rapped sharply on the door. They would have seen her coming and sent word, no doubt.</p> <p>The door swung open. A man filled the doorway, and Honoria took a half step back. He loomed over her by a good foot, a short black beard trimmed neatly over his jaw, and his head shaven. It wasn't the evil look in his green eyes that scared her, or the scars that dissected his face. It was the heavy bio-mechanic arm that had been fitted to his right shoulder, and the pair of glittering knives at his belt. His entire appearance spoke of violence.</p> <p>Breathe, she reminded herself, still staring up at him. Just breathe.</p> <p>As though her stare unnerved him, he gave a low grunt and jerked his head. "Inside. 'E's waitin'."</p> <p>Honoria couldn't resist a closer look at the arm as she stepped past. The metal spars were bare, the hydraulics clearly defined by the hoses that provided the pressure needed to move it. It was crude work. She'd seen better, a thousand times over, when her father worked for Lord Vickers. There wasn't even a scrap of synthetic flesh to cover it, though perhaps in this trade it would be more costly to constantly patch it against assault. And it was hardly likely that he could have gone to the Echelon's blacksmiths or metalworkers. This was a job created in the rookeries.</p> <p>"Up the stairs," he muttered. The door closed behind her with a sharp slam. Then the lock snicked.</p> <p>That nervous little fluttering started again, deep in her stomach. The hall stretched ahead endlessly, the timbers rotted and dusty. Hardly the place she'd have expected to find the master of the rookeries.</p> <p>To stall, Honoria reached up and started unpinning her hat, with its wilted black feathers and bedraggled scraps of lace. She could have sold it, and the dress she wore too, for both were far finer than her circumstances, but that would only lead Mr. Macy to ask questions. Smoke and mirrors, she thought. Her entire life was an illusion.</p> <p>"Ain't got all night," the doorman said.</p> <p>The hat finally came free, and she turned and shoved it at him. "I wouldn't want to disturb his breakfast."</p> <p>When he took the hat, as though surprised to do so, she started tugging on the stained leather of her kid gloves. Her fingers were cold and the leather fought her.</p> <p>The big man gestured up a flight of stairs. "After you."</p> <p>Honoria stalked past in a swish of skirts.</p> <p>The stairs were narrow and dusty. They creaked alarmingly, and she gripped the rail, half afraid they were going to collapse beneath her. There was a landing at the top, and she glanced around, wondering which door to take. Light glowed beneath one of the doors, a welcome sight.</p> <p>The doorman held it open, yellow light spilling out into the hall, and despite herself, she started toward it hungrily. It had the warm glow of a good fire, and she almost thought she could smell the scent of lemon wax in the air. Which was ridiculous.</p> <p>"Come in, Miz Pryor," a man called in an atrocious accent, using the name she'd assumed months ago. Garbled cockney from the sound of it, mixed with a healthy dose of...the upper classes?</p> <p>She frowned. A peculiar combination, but her ear had never been wrong before. That was why Mr. Macy kept her on. She had a talent for speech and could teach a parrot to sound like a duchess.</p> <p>The parlor could have belonged in any merchant's home. Honoria stopped in her tracks, surprised by the polished timber floors and the fine gilt-lined furnishings. In front of the glowing fireplace was a stuffed armchair, shadowing the man who sat within. She caught a glimpse of pale blond hair and the sheen of firelight sparking off his eyes. With the fire at his back, his features were indeterminate and even his build was difficult to define. Nothing but shadows and hints of movement.</p> <p>Despite her prejudice, she found herself peering at him curiously. The only blue bloods she'd known were of the Echelon, those born to the Great Houses and offered infected blood during the blood rites when they were fifteen. Only the extremely well born or influential were allowed the rites, but accidents occurred, of course, when the virus could be spread by the merest scratch or droplet of blood. Blade himself was considered a rogue blue blood, unsanctioned, his very existence an insult. If the Echelon could have killed him, they would have.</p> <p>She'd never met a rogue before. The only others who survived became Nighthawks...</p></p><h2>Miniatures and Morals: The Christian Novels of Jane Austen</h2><p>Not only are Austen's novels still widely read, they continue to influence modern film and literature. In both their moral content and their focused, highly detailed, "miniaturist" execution, they reveal Austen's mastery of the art of fiction and her concern for Christian virtues exercised within communities. She entertains, edifies, and challenges men and women readers alike.<p></p><p>From theological and literary angles, Leithart analyzes character and theme while summarizing each of Austen's major works--<i>Pride &amp; Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, Sense &amp; Sensibility, Mansfield Park, Emma,</i> and <i>Persuasion</i>. Including helpful review and thought questions for each section, this book is an excellent introduction to Austen for students and for all who desire a richer appreciation of her enduring genius.</p></p><p>Peter J.

He was involved in nearly all of the great battles of the East, from First Manassas through Appomattox; on the second day at Gettysburg, Alexander's battalion executed one of the greatest artillery charges of the war; Longstreet relied upon him for reconnaissance, and Stonewall Jackson wanted him made an infantry general.<br>Alexander wrote two books: a personal memoir intended for his children, which remained unnoticed until 1989, when it was published to enormous critical acclaim as <i>Fighting for the Confederacy;</i> and this book, <i>Military Memoirs of a Confederate, </i>which was first published in 1907 and immediately recognized as a classic. Unlike <i>Fighting for the Confederacy,</i> which was based largely on Alexander's own recollections, <i>Military Memoirs</i> relies on a vast amount of research.

Church-state issues have never been more complex, controversial, and divisive than they are today. In this helpful and instructive book, Ronald B. Flowers explains clearly and concisely the intricacies and implications of Supreme Court decisions in the volatile area of church-state relations. This is an ideal primer for those Americans who have listened to the debates about what the Supreme Court has and has not said about the relationship between church and state, and where the boundaries between the two have been eroded. It is also ideal for use in the classroom, specifically in undergraduate courses in religion and the court, introductions to U.S. constitutional law, constitutional law and politics, and the Supreme Court. The book is also a helpful tool for pastors, clarifying contemporary church-state issues that impact their churches and parishioners directly and indirectly.</p></p><p>"Ron Flowers&#x2019; book, now revised and updated, has long been a classic. Flowers succeeds in synthesizing the sometimes arcane and often complex Supreme Court decisions interpreting the First Amendment's religion clauses. In a bumper-sticker world, Flowers avoids the temptation to over-simplify, but still presents the material in a way that students and the general public alike can understand. By the way, lawyers and scholars could benefit from a peek at it too!" --J. Brent Walker, Executive Director, Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, Washington, D.C. <p>"At a time when misinformation and misunderstanding about the Religion Clauses and the role of the Supreme Court abound, this second edition could not be more timely. Flowers has accomplished what might seem to be the impossible in today's divisive climate: a coherent, readable, and comprehensive account of the Supreme Court and the cases that frame the issues at the center of church-state debate today. This highly accessible resource is essential for anyone wishing to make sense of the confusion wrought by the &#x2018;culture war.&#x2019;" --Barbara A.

Boethius's Latin dialogues found a receptive audience in Anglo-Saxon England, where they were translated into Old English some time around 900. The translator (traditionally identified with King Alfred) freely adapts the Latin for a new audience: the Roman Fabricius, for example, becomes the Germanic weapon-smith Weland. The translation replicates Boethius&#x2019;s alternation of prose and verse&#x2015;only in this case Old English prose alternates with alliterative verse.</p><p>In later centuries Chaucer and Queen Elizabeth each turned <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i> into English, but the Old English translation was the first to bring it to a wider vernacular audience. Verse prologues and epilogues for works traditionally associated with King Alfred fill out the volume, offering readers a fascinating glimpse of the moment when English confidently claimed its birthright as a literature capable of anything, from sublime ideas to subtle poetry.</p></p><p><p>Susan Irvine is Professor of English, University College London.</p><p>Malcolm R. Godden was Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford.</p><br>"Splendidly satisfies the need for an authoritative, accessible account of these remarkable texts. The two volumes offer scrupulous editions and Modern English translations, exhaustive textual apparatus, and insightful commentary...All original scholarship on the Boethius hereafter will owe a massive debt to Godden and Irvine for opening up so many new possibilities...Oxford University Press has done justice to the editors' achievement by producing both volumes to high standards." --Speculum<p><br></p></p><h2>The Life Cycle of a Mosquito</h2><p>Ages 6 to 12 years.

Brown traces the theme of moral identity and conduct throughout the Old Testament,</p><p>At a time when the chasm between academic scholarship and theological reflection seems to be widening, both the academic guild and the church share in common an uncertainty over how to study and appropriate the wisdom literature of the Old Testament. On the one hand, mainline denominations have for the most part avoided the books of Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes in their preaching and educational curriculum. Biblical scholars, on the other hand, have labored hard to identify the theological significance and thematic center of the wisdom literature, but without much consensus. In Character in Crisis, William P. Brown helps to break the impasse by demonstrating that the aim of the Bible&#39;s wisdom literature is the formation of moral character - both for individuals and for the community. Brown traces the theme of moral identity and conduct throughout the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, with a concluding reflection on the Epistle of James in the New Testament, and explores a range of issues that includes literary characterization, moral discourse, worldview, and the theology of the ancient sages. He examines the ways in which central characters such as God, wisdom, and human beings are profiled in the wisdom books and shows how their characterizations impart ethical meaning to the reading community, both ancient and modern.William P. Brown is associate professor of Old Testament at Union Theological Seminary in Virginia.</p><h2>Peel My Love Like an Onion: A Novel</h2><p>The seductive world of flamenco forms the backdrop for a classic tale of independence found, lost, and reclaimed. Like Bizet's legendary gypsy, Carmen "La Coja" (The Cripple) Santos is hilarious, passionate, triumphant, and mesmerizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;A renowned flamenco dancer in Chicago despite the legacy of childhood polio, Carmen has long enjoyed an affair with Agust�n, the married director of her troupe--a romance that's now growing stale. When she begins a new, passionate liaison with Manolo, Agust�n's grandson and a dancer of natural genius, an angry rivalry is sparked. Carmen finally makes her way back to happiness in this funny, fiery story that's equal parts soap opera, tragicomedy, and rhapsody.</p><p>Ana Castillo's voice is one of self-confident, hypnotic melancholy. <i>Peel My Love Like an Onion</i>, her fifth book, often reads like a diary rather than a novel--full of dashed-off midnight eloquence but unformed. It's the story of Carmen Santos, a flamenco dancer whose right leg is shriveled from polio. Her family moved from Mexico to Chicago before she was born: "My first language was Spanish but I am not really Mexican. I guess I am Chicago-Mexican." Castillo sees the immigrant experience as a minefield of ironies. Carmen works at the Domino's in the airport as a way of being a productive American, thus gaining her father's respect. One morning on a "power walk" she realizes that the shoes she is wearing may have been made in a sweatshop by some distant relative from "somewhere... very foreign, like seaweed-and-black-fungus-in-French-Vietnamese-soup foreign."<p> As the book moves back and forth between Carmen's dreams of economic and emotional freedom and her erotic life (in which passion often feels as much like a trap as a release), Castillo's fluid style often lapses into carelessness. And there is a blurred quality to many of the images, like photographs taken from a moving car. Carmen's story is most engaging when she experiences isolated moments of independence: flamenco dancing, for instance, for the customers at a hair salon where she is working, dragging her bad leg around in front of the ladies under the hair dryers. The scene--a moment to relish--is almost heroic in its defiance of the exhausted world. <i>--Emily White</i></p>"A fiery treatise on losing control in love.... Unforgettable."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"If you have read Ana Castillo's work before, you will not be disappointed--. If you have not read Castillo before--where have you been?"--<i>Houston Chronicle</i><br><br>"Reading <b>Peel My Love Like an Onion</b> reminds us of our own small but glorious victories. Ana Castillo has written her best novel to date."--<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"The best of Ana Castillo: sassy, satiric, and stunningly lyrical."--Julia Alvarez</p><h2>Tin Can Cook: 75 Simple Store-cupboard Recipes</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the OFM Best Food Personality </b><b>Readers' Award</b><b>, 2018</b></p><p>Food writer and anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe presents <i>Tin Can Cook</i>, bringing together seventy-five recipes that you can rustle up from tinned and dried ingredients.

Taking the numerous statements and references by Rudolf Steiner as his starting point, Marti develops our understanding of the etheric world in various fields&#x2015;from the theory of knowledge to the natural world, through to music, the realm of colors, eurythmy and medicine. In doing so, he proposes exciting bridges from the ancient and medieval worldview to the present and future of natural and spiritual science.</p> <p>The Etheric explores the fourfold realm of the ethers. Giving an overview of their cosmic origins in the evolution of the earth, Dr. Marti shows how the ethers work in phenomena of warmth, light, sound, and organic life. He brings a contemporary understanding and insight to the classical elements&#x2015;fire, air, water, and earth&#x2015;as the media through which ethericity manifests and works in the world. Four physical forces are also explored which, as opposites of the ethers, have a constant tendency to break down and annul what life-giving ether creates. Dr. Marti then studies the shadow aspects of the ethers connected to what he terms the &#x2018;sub-natural&#x2019; forces of electricity, magnetism, and nuclear force.</p> <p>Given that the author was unable to complete this book in his lifetime, his pupil and colleague Irmgard Rossmann edited the final version in the spirit of her teacher. It is published here in two volumes, with this first focusing on the world of the ethers, with the second volume on the world of formative forces.</p></p><p><p><b>Ernst Marti&nbsp;</b>(1903&#x2013;1985) was born in Switzerland and studied medicine in Vienna and Basel.

McKillip lives in Oregon.<b>Praise for <i>Dreams of Distant Shores</i></b><br><br><b>An Overdrive Recommended Book</b><br><br><b>[STAR]</b> McKillip (<i>Wonders of the Invisible World</i>), winner of the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, collects nine dazzling shorter pieces (both originals and reprints) in this outstanding collection. The brief, creepy Weird&#x201d; opens the volume, merging an oddly romantic picnic in a bathroom and a mysterious threat outside into something that exists in a darkly beautiful interstitial place. The longest piece, Something Rich and Strange,&#x201d; which appeared originally as a standalone novella in Brian Froud&#x2019;s Faerielands series, is an ecological fairy tale that contains the most gorgeous of McKillip&#x2019;s prose ( her blind stare of pearl and wormwood&#x201d;) and the weakest of her plots, but even weaker McKillip is well worth reading. The newer stories also shine. Mer&#x201d; is a small gem about a nameless witch, a fishing village, and a mermaid statue. Edith and Henry Go Motoring&#x201d; features a toll bridge that leads travelers on an unexpected journey. Beyond the short fiction, the volume finishes with an essay on writing high fantasy, and an appreciation of McKillip&#x2019;s work by renowned fantasist Peter S. Beagle. Fans of exquisite prose and ethereal fantasy will need to own this.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> A young couple trade odd stories in a bathroom as something rages outside.

From Normandy through the "breakout" in France to the German army's last gasp in the Battle of the Bulge, Doubler deals with the deadly business of war&#x2014;closing with the enemy, fighting and winning battles, taking and holding territory. His study provides a provocative reassessment of how American GIs accomplished these dangerous and costly tasks.<br><br>Doubler portrays a far more capable and successful American fighting force than previous historians&#x2014;notably Russell Weigley, Martin Van Creveld, and S.L.A. Marshall&#x2014;have depicted. True, the GIs weren't fully prepared or organized for a war in Europe and have often been viewed as inferior to their German opponent. But, Doubler argues, they more than compensated for this by their ability to learn quickly from mistakes, to adapt in the face of unforeseen obstacles, and to innovate new tactics on the battlefield. This adaptability, Doubler contends, was far more crucial to the American effort than we've been led to believe.<br><br>Fueled by a fiercely democratic and entrepreneurial spirit, GI innovations emerged from every level within the ranks-from the novel employment of conventional weapons and small units to the rapid retraining of troops on the battlefield. Their most dramatic success, however, was with combined arms warfare&#x2014;the coordinated use of infantry, tanks, artillery, air power, and engineers&#x2014;in which they perfected the use of air support for ground operations and tank-infantry teams for breaking through enemy strongholds.<br><br>Doubler argues that, without such ingenuity and imaginative leadership, it would have been impossible to defeat an enemy as well trained and heavily fortified as the German army the GIs confronted in the tortuous hedgerow country of northern France, the narrow cobble-stoned streets of Aachen and Brest, the dark recesses of the Huertgen Forest, and the frigid snow-covered hills of the Ardennes.<br><br>Doubler offers a timely reminder that "the tremendous effects of firepower and technology will still not relieve ground troops of the burden of closing with the enemy." As even Desert Storm suggests, that will likely prove true for future high-tech battlefields, where an army's adaptability will continue to be prized.</p><p>&#39;Unflinchingly objective. Doubler makes a convincing case for seeing the GI as an amateur who learned quickly and well and who, by the end of the war, had turned himself into a formidable enemy.&#39; -- John Keegan in the Washington TimesLieutenant Colonel Michael D. Doubler serves in the office of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, Headquarters, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C. He received his Ph.D. from Ohio State University and has taught at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.</p><h2>Spinning History: Politics and Propaganda in World War II</h2><p>In this fascinating book, more relevant than ever in today's political climate of "alternative facts," bestselling author and historian Nathaniel Lande explores the Great War at the heart of the twentieth century through the prism of theater. He presents the war as a drama that evolved and developed as it progressed, a production staged and overseen by four contrasting masters: Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin.<br><br>Each leader used all the tools at his disposal to present his own distinctive vision of the global drama that was the Second World War. Each area of the media was fully exploited. Brilliantly conceived oratory was applied to underscore each vision. Impression management, the art of political spin, was employed to drive the message home with the careful use of black and white propaganda. Each side employed uniforms, meticulously staged events, and broadcast their messages via all media available&#x2014;motion pictures, radio broadcasts, songs, posters, leaflets, and beyond. Their ambitions were similar, but each leader had his own distinct methods, his own carefully created script for elaborately produced and often wildly successful acts and campaigns of deception to win hearts and minds on the frontlines and the home front.<br><br>The result of this investigation is a wholly distinctive and often surprising work of history, a book that manages to cast a fresh light on the most obsessively studied conflict in human history.</p><p><b>Nathaniel Lande,</b> PhD, is a journalist, filmmaker, and author of eleven books, including <i>Cricket</i> and <i>Dispatches from the Front: A History of the American War Correspondent</i>. He was creative director of the Magazine Group, TIME Inc.; director of TIME World News Service; and executive producer for CBS and NBC. He was educated at Oxford University, earned his doctorate at Trinity College in Dublin, and has held appointments as professor to the School of Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. He resides in Santa Barbara, California.I lived through World War II as a well-informed teenager, or so I thought. At fifteen, I was hired by my local daily newspaper to replace the sports editor who had enlisted in the Navy. That gave me unique access to the United Press teletype that day and night poured out news of the world in conflict. I listened to FDR&#x2019;s Fireside chats and network war correspondents on the radio. . . . I watched newsreels and war films. I was acutely aware of what was going on, right? Little did I know. This fascinating book explains how I and millions around the world were fed a history lesson full of dramatic propaganda that was aimed at winning our confidence and eventually the war. Another publishing triumph for Nathaniel Lande.&#x201d; Richard B. Stolley, former editorial director of TIME Inc.; editor of <i>Life</i> magazine; founding editor of <i>People</i> magazine<br><br> <i>Spinning History</i> illuminates how all sides used social psychology, propaganda, and drama to shape and skew public opinion during World War II, as well as how these myriad efforts interplayed nationally and internationally during the war and in its history. The starring roles of Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin are detailed thoughtfully and compellingly. The book is original and insightful.&#x201d; Richard Cole, PhD, John Kerr Distinguished Professor and Dean Emeritus, School of Media and Journalism, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br><br> World War II wasn&#x2019;t just the century&#x2019;s greatest conflict, but also its greatest theatrical production. <i>Spinning History</i> is an illuminating, readable, and still very relevant account of the ways in which theatrical staging, dramatic storytelling, and message manipulation were key to the efforts of both sides during those turbulent years.&#x201d; Richard Zoglin, senior editor, TIME magazine<br><br> This book by awarding-winning Renaissance man, Nathaniel Lande, takes a familiar subject, World War II, and presents it in a new light indeed in a spotlight. Taking war as the ultimate piece of theatre, it concentrates on the principal characters from both sides, but finds room for a wide-ranging consideration of minor cast members and plots. It is a timely reminder that the conflict was the first modern war, in which propaganda and media manipulation played a huge part, not only on opening night, but in ensuring that it had an extended run.&#x201d; Dr. Andrea Tanner, senior research fellow, Institute of Historical Research, University of London</p><h2>Private London (Private, 4)</h2><p><b>In James Patterson's #1 bestselling Private series, the world's most exclusive detective agency hunts London's most mysterious killer.</b><br>For Hannah Shapiro, a young American student, the nightmare began eight years ago in Los Angeles, when the owner of Private-the world's most exclusive detective agency-saved her from a horrific death.

Mystics and &#x201c;idealists&#x201d; have always propounded the idea that the world is an illusion. Now quantum physics is putting forward theories that reinforce this belief. <br><br> Until recently, the empirical approach of physicists such as Newton has taught us that the world exists with or without human consciousness to observe it. But we can never be totally objective about reality. The human mind, with all its preconceived notions and prejudices, always intrudes, even in the most scientific of experiments, making true objectivity impossible to achieve. <br><br>The new physicists state that reality is a combination of the laws of the physical world, quantifiable and unequivocal, and the subjective viewpoint of the observer. This &#x201c;omnijective view&#x201d; of the universe challenges all our most deeply held scientific beliefs and could radically change the way we view reality in the future. As our constructs are amended to this shift in approach, we can anticipate monumental changes in Western thought.</p><p><b>Michael Talbot</b> was an author and prominent figure in the quantum mysticism movement. Originally a science-fiction author and writer for the<i>&nbsp;Village Voice</i>, he rose to prominence with his nonfiction works, including <i>Mysticism and the New Physics</i>,&nbsp;<i>Beyond the Quantum</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Holographic Universe.</i> He died in 1992.</p><h2>The Pentateuch: Introducing the Torah (Introducing Israel&#39;s Scriptures)</h2><p><p>The Pentateuch is the heart of the Hebrew Bible and the foundational document of Judaism. It is also the focus of tremendous scholarly exploration and debate today regarding the complex history of its composition. This history will be explored along with analysis of the historical background and ancient Near Eastern parallels for its primeval history, its ancestry narratives, and laws, the theological purposes of its final redaction, and the diverse ways it is interpreted in communities today.</p><p>In this textbook, Thomas B. Dozeman, one of the leading scholars of the Pentateuch today, introduces students to its contents and structure of each book, and orients them to the Pentateuch's place in the Hebrew Bible and in the interpretive traditions of Judaism and Christianity. Dozeman deftly introduces the key interpretive questions and methods that shape contemporary scholarship and explains their consequences, inviting students into the invigorating work of interpretation today.</p></p><p>Thomas B. Dozeman is professor of Hebrew Bible at United Theological Seminary, Dayton, Ohio, and co-chair of the SBL Pentateuch Group. He is the author of a number of scholarly books and commentaries, and co-editor of <i>The Pentateuch: International Perspectives on Current Research,</i> (2010) and <i>A Farewell to the Yahwist? The Composition of the Pentateuch in Recent European Interpretation</i> (2006).</p><h2>Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, NT Volume 8)</h2><p>Paul&#39;s letters to the Galatians, Ephesians and Philippians have struck an indelible impression on Christian tradition and piety. The doctrines of Christ, of salvation and of the church all owe their profiles to these letters. And for patristic interpreters, who read Scripture as a single book and were charged with an insatiable curiosity regarding the mysteries of the Godhead, these letters offered profound visions seldom captured by modern eyes. Trinitarian truth was patterned in the apostle&#39;s praise of God who is &#34;over all, through all and in all&#34; (Ephesians 4:6). Without a doubt, the greatest text in this collection of letters is the &#34;Christ hymn&#34; of Philippians 2:6-11. This commentary offers an unparalleled close-up view of the fathers weighing the words and phrases of this panoramic charting of the Savior&#39;s journey from preexistence, to incarnation, to crucifixion, to triumphant exaltation as universal Lord. This volume opens a treasury of resources for biblical study today. The expository voices of Jerome, Origen, Augustine, Chrysostom, Ambrosiaster, Theodoret, Marius Victorinus and Theodore of Mopsuestia speak again with eloquence and intellectual acumen, some in English translation for the first time.</p><p>Volume editor <strong>Mark J.

Here the insights of scores of early church fathers will be assembled and made readily available for significant passages throughout the Bible and the Apocrypha. It is hard to think of a more worthy ecumenical project to be undertaken by InterVarsity Press." (Bruce M. Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

His hands groped for bedclothes, found nothing. Sensing wrongness, his consciousness rose through layers of befuddlement and wisps of dreams. He opened his eyes to find a gaping maw of three-inch fangs inches from his throat. </p> <p>"Aah!"</p> <p>Nathaniel threw up his arms to shield his face and twisted to the side. The convulsive movement brought him right to the edge of a large four-poster bed, and he scrambled to avoid falling three feet to the floor. He twisted in the opposite direction and struck out at the sharp, yellowed teeth. They did not snap shut on his forearm or lunge into his face once more. Indeed, they did not move at all, except sideways under his blow. There was no snarl or slaver, no spark of rage in the shiny eye behind the fangs. Nathaniel shoved them farther away and sat up.</p> <p>He was stark naked, on a large bed stripped bare of linens, covered only by a moth-eaten gray wolf skin. The wretched thing's head had been carefully placed on his chest, to ensure the rude awakening. His hips still rested under its hindquarters. Molting fur peppered the bed. The mere sight of the ancient pelt made his skin itch. Revolted, he pushed it all the way off and moved to the foot of the bed, struggling to get his bearings. This wasn't his bedchamber. The blue-striped wallpaper was alien, the furnishings unfamiliar; the windows with their slant of early morning light were in the wrong place. Then he remembered. He was staying at the Earl of Moreley's country house, because tomorrow-no, today-he was to marry the earl's daughter at their local parish church.</p> <p>Nathaniel glared at the wolf skin, then rubbed his hands over his face. This was what it meant to have five brothers-five younger brothers-on one's wedding day. Or rather, on one's wedding eve, a night they'd insisted upon marking with bowls of rack punch. Had it been three? Or had he lost count? No wonder they'd kept filling his glass, if they had this prank planned. Where the devil had they found a wolf skin in a strange house? And hadn't he told his father, when Robert was born in his sixth year, that four sons were quite enough? Even for a duke, six sons were excessive. At this particular moment, Nathaniel thought that his parents might have been content with just one.</p> <p>He rose, stretching stiff limbs and marveling that he had only a mild headache. Revenge on his brothers would have to wait for another day. Today, he was getting married. He was doing his duty to his name and his line, pledging himself to a woman who would be an admirable duchess when their turn came-may it be far in the future. The match was eminently suitable. All society acknowledged its rightness. And despite Violet's irascible grandmother, the occasional bane of his existence, he could have no complaints.</p> <p>Indeed, why had the word even occurred to him? No one had rushed him into marriage. He had enjoyed a plenitude of seasons in London and a number of agreeable flirtations and liaisons with delightful females. Though they had never spoken of it, he was aware that his parents had given him every opportunity to fall in love. But the passion that had overtaken them in their young days had not befallen him. He wasn't sure why, but once he'd passed thirty he concluded it never would. He'd had more than enough time to observe that such a bond was rare in the circles of the haut ton.</p> <p>Nathaniel stretched again, his bare limbs a bit chilly. This marriage was certainly not a penance. He liked Violet very much. They'd been acquainted for years. He did not know whether she'd had other offers, but he supposed that she too had waited for love to find her. They had that in common. They were also well suited by background, had similar tastes, and enjoyed the same even temperament. When he'd decided that the time for marriage had come, he'd simply known that she was the proper candidate. He expected their union to be gracious, harmonious, and ideal for the significant position they would someday be called upon to fulfill. And now it was time to stop woolgathering, put on his dressing gown, and begin this momentous day.</p> <p>Nathaniel walked over to the oaken wardrobe on the far wall and opened it.</p> <p>It was empty. All his clothes had disappeared.</p> <p>He stared at the bare hooks. This part of the prank would be Sebastian's doing, he imagined. It had his next younger brother's touch. Nathaniel met his own gaze in the mirror set into the wardrobe door, and acknowledged the spark of amused annoyance in his eyes. His brothers had a fiendish facility for complicated jests.</p> <p>The figure in the glass shook its head. All the sons of the Duke of Langford were tall, handsome, broad-shouldered men with auburn hair and blue eyes. Sebastian was the tallest. Robert the wittiest. Randolph was acknowledged as the handsomest, James the most adventurous, and Alan the smartest. But he was the eldest, and the heir.</p> <p>For as long as he could remember, Nathaniel had felt the weight of his destiny. The others said it was a burden to have everything done ahead of them, but he'd felt the onus of being the pattern, setting up the expectations, being the son visitors scrutinized the most. He would be the next duke; he must show he was worthy. Thus, he kept a tight rein on his wilder impulses. Instead, he was the one who came to the rescue when one of his brothers went too far, kicking up a lark.</p> <p>And so now, he did not slam the empty wardrobe shut, but simply closed it. He would leave it to his valet to straighten this out. He wanted hot water for washing, and then clothes, and then breakfast. He went to ring for Cates, and discovered that the bell rope had been removed. He could see the wire to which it had been connected, near the ceiling, twelve feet up. It must have taken two or three of his brothers to reach so high.</p> <p>For a moment he just stood there, staring at it. This final touch would be Robert's idea, no doubt. He'd always been the most ingenious, the brother who added the crowning climax to a prank. Robert would be the one to set the others guffawing-describing their elder brother slinking through the corridors of the Earl of Moreley's house wrapped in a wolf skin, like some sort of demented ancient Celt. Even Nathaniel had to smile at the picture. How would Violet's fierce stickler of a grandmother like that? And all the other near and distant relations visiting for the wedding? He'd barely met most of them. Perhaps he'd twine some ivy from outside the window in his hair and attempt a Gaelic war cry.</p> <p>Nathaniel laughed. Truth to tell, it was a splendid prank, unfolding like a puzzle box upon its hapless victim. All that remained was for him to wiggle out of the trap so cunningly set.</p> <p>He eyed the windows and considered pulling down some of his almost-mother-in-law's elaborate draperies to wrap about himself. But one panel would trail behind him like a coronation robe. The picture was little better than the wolf skin. Perhaps he would just wait until Cates arrived on his own. It couldn't be too much longer. In fact, judging by the sunlight, his valet ought to have appeared well before now. Where the devil was he?</p> <p>As if in answer to this thought, there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>"Nathaniel?"</p> <p>The voice was the last he expected. "Violet?"</p> <p>"Are you all right? James said you needed to speak to me most urgent-" The door opened, and Nathaniel's promised bride looked around the panels. "Oh!" Her mouth dropped open.</p> <p>Nathaniel-stark naked, next to a bed sporting only a rumpled wolf skin-braced for a shriek, a shocked retreat, babbled apologies. But Violet just looked at him. Indeed, it seemed as if she couldn't tear her eyes away. He could almost feel her gaze traveling along his skin, as if it left trails of warmth. He saw something stir in those gray eyes, something he'd never observed before, and his body began to respond to the possibility of much more than he'd expected from his suitable marriage. Respond all too eagerly.</p> <p>Nathaniel moved over behind the bed. "My brothers' idea of a joke," he said with a gesture toward the wolf skin.</p> <p>Violet blinked. Color flooded her cheeks, and she looked away. "How did they...?" Her voice was rather choked.</p> <p>"They are endlessly inventive. They stole my clothes as well. Would you have someone send Cates to me? I would ring but"-he pointed to the bell wire-"they were quite thorough."</p> <p>Violet glanced at the denuded wire, swallowed, and gave a quick nod. "Of course." In the next instant, she was gone.</p> <p>"Well, well," murmured Nathaniel to the wolf. "That was interesting."</p> <p>His days of being capable of interest long past, the wolf made no reply.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Outside the closed door, Lady Violet Devere put her hands to her blazing cheeks and took a moment to recover her breath before going in search of Nathaniel's valet. She'd never seen a grown man totally naked before. Half-naked, yes. Perhaps three quarters, if you counted...? What was wrong with her brain? It was jumping about like a startled grasshopper.</p> <p>It was just... Nathaniel had seemed so very naked. She hadn't been able to look away; she hadn't even been able to think that she should avert her eyes. The sight of him-so tall and handsome and...naked had been riveting. And tonight she would be his wife, granted the...freedom of all that...nakedness. She had married friends; she knew what that meant.</p> <p>Of course she had married friends. She was twenty-six years old! Which explained why she'd opened his bedchamber door. When she shouldn't have. It was quite improper. But his brother James had sounded so odd when he spoke to her. She'd leapt to dire conclusions and rushed in, fearing that the wedding was to be put off, that her grandmother had said or done something outrageous. The thought was insupportable. Her future was settled at last. She would grow no older waiting to marry. She would not watch yet another crop of debs enter society and pair off.</p> <p>It was all very well for Nathaniel. He was a man, free of the countless idiotic strictures that beset an unmarried "girl" with an iron-willed grandmother who was absolutely devoted to the proprieties. He could do whatever he liked with his...really gorgeous body.</p> <p>Violet took a deep breath, and then another. She stood straighter, consciously relaxed tense muscles. All was well. It had merely been a prank. She knew about pranks; she had two much younger brothers, welcomed with relief after her disappointing female birth, and rather spoiled by their parents. A belated laugh escaped her. The sons of the Duke of Langford must be masters of the art to have somehow stranded Nathaniel, naked, with the skin of the wolf her grandfather had shot in the wilds of Russia. Wasn't it kept in a locked cabinet?</p> <p>Violet started for the servants' hall, slightly hampered by the cascade of ruffles at the hem of her white dress. She jerked the fabric out of her way. She hated white, and was all too aware that the hue did not flatter her. It washed out her pale complexion, her sandy hair and gray eyes. Put her in white-in any pastel, really-and she practically faded into the wallpaper. Of course, this didn't matter to Grandmamma. An unmarried girl wore pale colors, and that was that. The rules were not to be questioned, even when they made one look a complete frump. And Violet's mother existed firmly under her mother-in-law's thumb.</p> <p>Catching movement in the corner of her eye, Violet paused before a long mirror on the corridor wall. Her features were good, if she did say so-straight nose, well-shaped lips, eyes a lucent gray. If allowed to make something of them, with a more fashionable haircut and perhaps just a touch of color for her cheeks...? Violet imagined her grandmother's horror at the latter idea. She imagined it for several seconds.</p> <p>How she hated ruffles. And this dress had far too many, cluttering the silhouette, obscuring the lines of her form. She'd seen gowns at London balls that would have accentuated the subtle curves she definitely possessed, in colors and fabrics that would flatter rather than subdue.</p> <p>The question popped into her mind: what would Nathaniel think if he came upon her naked?</p> <p>Violet flushed again. The rosy hue was quite becoming. She stared at her reflection and acknowledged that it was going to be quite...interesting to see what Nathaniel thought. Their match was the union of two great families. And as Violet's grandmother never tired of repeating, it wasn't about her. Nathaniel needed a wife who could be a proper duchess. But perhaps he needed other things as well. Violet watched her mirror image smile in a quite unfamiliar way.</p> <p>She scarcely recognized herself. It was as if impulses long stifled were surfacing in the mirror, summoned by the sight of her almost-husband. Violet blinked. If her grandmother, or her father, or her mother came along now, she'd be in for a scold. Fierce, cold, fearful-they each had their way of pointing out her shortcomings. Of which she seemed to have a never-ending supply. At times, it had even seemed to Violet that her family valued their criticisms more than her future prospects.</p> <p>She was crushing the hated ruffles in both hands, she realized. She opened them.</p> <p>It didn't matter. Nathaniel had offered for her. In a few hours she would be a married woman, and everything would be different. She could do as she pleased. She would no longer live with her grandmother. She would not be told what to wear and whom she could see. She would not be scrutinized for flaws at every turn. In her own household, she would be the arbiter. In fact, she had a list of things Grandmamma had forbidden, and she intended to indulge in them as soon as might be. Violet nodded at her reflection with a steely gaze that would have startled those who thought they knew her.</p> <p>A footman appeared at the end of the corridor. Violet dropped her eyes and moved away from the mirror, resuming her mantle of sweet compliance. "John, would you tell Cates that his lordship wants him? The bell is...broken." Violet wondered what that prim valet would think when he found Nathaniel naked with a wolf skin? But perhaps he was used to pranks; he had been with Nathaniel for a long time, and it seemed the Duke of Langford's sons were addicted to them.</p> <p>"Mr. Cates seems to be out this morning, your ladyship," replied the footman, his face stiff with disapproval.</p> <p>"Out? Where?"</p> <p>"No one seems to know, your ladyship."</p> <p>That was odd. Or... It must be part of the prank. Violet nodded to the footman and walked farther along the corridor until she heard male voices from a small parlor on her right. Taking another step on paths forbidden by her grandmother, Violet eased the door open a crack and peeked through. All of Nathaniel's brothers were gathered around the hearth, a very handsome conspiracy. Shamelessly, Violet eavesdropped.</p> <p>"This has gone far enough. We should take him some clothes," said Alan.</p> <p>He was the youngest brother, and the only one married so far, Violet recalled. He lived in Oxford and did something at the university. Violet thought she might like his wife, Ariel. She hadn't had a chance to find out, because Grandmamma didn't approve of her...</p></p><h2>JEAN GREY VOL. 1: NIGHTMARE FUEL</h2><p>When the teenage Marvel Girl traveled through time and arrived in the present, she learned the terrible fate that befell her adult counterpart.

But when a dutiful Amish woman&#x2019;s life is turned upside down, she may have to risk her heart to get everything she&#x2019;s always wanted in this charming Pleasant Valley novel.</b><br><br>Since her mother&#x2019;s death, Naomi Esch has been devoted to caring for her father and siblings, sacrificing any hope of finding love or having a home of her own. Still, working at the local bakery and expanding her beekeeping business give Naomi a satisfying sense of purpose. Then, in the weeks before Christmas, her father announces his plans to remarry. He and his new wife need the house for themselves, leaving Naomi in need of a plan.<br><br>But opportunities soon come her way. A friend finds Naomi a place to stay, and widower Nathan King offers his sprawling farmland to Naomi to continue her business&#x2014;on the condition that she helps take care of his children. The setup is so perfect that the community assumes a wedding will inevitably follow. But Naomi has vowed never to marry without love. And to Nathan she&#x2019;s merely convenient help. Now, for those in Pleasant Valley, uniting these two stubborn souls may take a Christmas miracle.</p><p>A lifetime spent in rural Pennsylvania and her own Pennsylvania Dutch roots led <b>Marta Perry</b> to write about the Plain People who add to the rich heritage of her home state. She is the author of more than fifty inspirational romance novels, including the Pleasant Valley series and the Keepers of the Promise trilogy. She lives with her husband in a century-old farmhouse.<p><b>Chapter One<br><br></b></p><p>Naomi Esch froze in her seat at the family table, unable to stop staring at her father. Daadi had just tossed what felt like a lightning bolt into the middle of her thirtieth birthday celebration. Around her, she could feel her siblings and their spouses stuck in equally unbelieving attitudes.</p><p>"Ach, what is wrong with all of you?" Daadi's eyes narrowed, his beard seeming to bristle as he glared at his offspring. "This is a reason to celebrate, ain't so?"</p><p>Lovina, her brother Elijah's wife, was the first to recover, her calm face showing little of what she felt. "We wish you and Betty much happiness." She bounced Amos, her two-year-old, on her lap, hushing him. "Wilkom, Betty."</p><p>Betty Shutz, a round dumpling of a woman with a pair of shrewd brown eyes, nodded and smiled, but the glance she sent toward Naomi was cautious.</p><p>Isaiah, the youngest and most impetuous, said what everyone was thinking. "But what about Naomi? If you and Betty are marrying, what is Naomi to do?"</p><p>The question roused Naomi from her frozen state. What was she supposed to do, after fifteen years spent raising her siblings, tending the house and garden and her beehives, and taking care of Daadi?</p><p>Daadi's gaze shifted, maybe a bit uneasily. "Naomi is a gut daughter, none better. No one would deny that. But newlyweds want to have time alone together, ja? So we . . . I was thinking Naomi would move in with Elijah and Lovina. They are both busy with the dry-goods store and two young kinder besides. It would be a big help to you, ja?"</p><p>Elijah and Lovina exchanged glances, and then Lovina smiled at Naomi. "Nothing would please us more than to have Naomi with us, but that is for her to say, ain't so?"</p><p>"Denke, Lovina." Naomi found that her stiff lips could move, after all. "But what about my beehives?"</p><p>Odd, that her thoughts had flown so quickly to her bees in the face of this shock. Or maybe not so odd. The beehives were the only thing she could call truly hers.</p><p>"I've already talked to Dick Holder about the hives, and he'll be happy to give Naomi a gut price for them." Daad spoke as if it were all settled, her life completely changed in a few short minutes.</p><p>"I will not sell the hives." Naomi could hardly believe that strong tone was coming out of her mouth. Everyone else looked equally surprised. Maybe they'd never heard such firmness from her.</p><p>Daad's eyebrows drew down as he stared at her. "Komm, Naomi, don't be stubborn. It is the sensible thing to do. Betty is allergic to bee stings, so the hives cannot stay here. And Elijah's home in town isn't suitable. The money will give you a nice little nest egg for the future."</p><p>A babble of talk erupted around her as everyone seemed to have an opinion, but Naomi's thoughts were stuck on the words Daad had used. Her future. He clearly thought he knew what that future was to be. She should move from one sibling to another, helping to raise their children, never having a home or a life of her own.</p><p>She was engaging in selfish thinking, maybe, and it was unfitting for a humble Amish person. But . . .</p><p>She looked around the table. Elijah, two years younger than she, whom she'd comforted when bad dreams woke him in the night. Anna and Sara, the next two in the family, who had traveled by bus with their husbands from the next county for her birthday today. She'd taught the girls everything they needed to know to be Amish women, overseen their rumspringas, seen them married to gut men they loved. And Isaiah, the baby, the one whose first stumbling steps she'd guided. Were they to be her future, as they had her past?</p><p>Much as she loved them, her heart yearned for more. Marriage might have passed her by during those years when she was busy raising her siblings, but she'd looked forward to a satisfying future, taking care of Daad, tending her hives, enjoying her part-time work at the bakery.</p><p>Amos slid down from his mother's lap and toddled around the table to tug on Naomi's skirt. A glance at his face told her he'd detected the strain in the air. She lifted him to her lap, running her hand down his back, murmuring soothing words. He leaned against her, relaxing, sucking on two fingers as he always did before going to sleep.</p><p>Lovina met her gaze from across the table and smiled. "Naomi is wonderful gut with children."</p><p>"For sure," Betty said, her first contribution to the conversation. "A widower with kinder would do well to have a wife like Naomi."</p><p>Somehow, that comment, coming from Betty, was the last straw. Naomi had to speak now, and quickly, before the rest of her life was set in stone by the family.</p><p>"You are all ser kind to give so much thought to my life. But as dearly as I love my nieces and nephews, I have no wish to raise them. And I will not give up my beehives. So I think I must find this answer for myself."</p><p>She took advantage of the ensuing silence to move the drowsy child to his father's arms. Grabbing a heavy wool shawl from the peg by the back door, she walked out, closing the door gently behind her.</p><p>Mid-November, and it was ser chilly already, a hint of the winter to come. Even the hardy mums on the sheltered side of the house had succumbed to frost. Clutching the shawl more tightly, she walked across brittle grass to the gnarled old apple tree that had once held a tree house when the boys were young. It was a relief to get out of the kitchen, too warm from all the cooking that had been done today for her birthday. This day had certainly turned out far different from the celebration her sisters had so lovingly planned.</p><p>She stopped under the tree, resting her hand against the rough bark. No point in going farther-she couldn't escape her family, and she wouldn't want to. Soon someone would come out to talk to her, and she would have to explain and justify and try to make them understand. But for this moment she was alone with her thoughts.</p><p>The family had one thing right. She did have a gift with children, and she couldn't deny that gift. But to raise someone else's children again, to grow to love them so dearly, but to know that she always took second place in their hearts . . . no, she couldn't. But when she tried to think how to carry out that brave declaration she'd made, she found she was lacking in ideas.</p><p>It was Isaiah who came out to her. Maybe they thought the youngest would be most likely to soften her heart. But Isaiah was a man grown now, married for just a year, and so much in love with his Libby. Not a baby any longer, but he still seemed so young to her with his round blue eyes and his corn-silk hair. The beard he was growing as a married man was as fine and silky as his hair.</p><p>He leaned against the tree next to her, his eyes serious as he studied her face. "Are you all right?"</p><p>Naomi managed a smile, though it probably wasn't very convincing. "Ja. I will be, anyway. I guess Daad's news was a shock."</p><p>"For sure." Isaiah shook his head. "It wonders me that none of us saw this marriage coming, but we didn't. I guess we all figured that if Daad had been going to wed again, he'd have done it years ago."</p><p>"Then Betty would have had the raising of you." Her smile was more natural this time.</p><p>Isaiah seemed to shudder. "Ach, I'm sure she's a gut woman. But I'm glad it was you who brought me up, Naomi."</p><p>For an instant she was surprised almost to tears. "Denke," she whispered, her throat tight. She'd never say she loved one more than another, but Isaiah was especially dear, both because he was the baby and because of his sweet nature.</p><p>She tilted her head, watching him, wondering how he would react to the question she was about to put to him. "What about you, Isaiah? Do you think I'm being selfish not to do what Daadi wants?"</p><p>He blinked, eyes wide and innocent. "Ach, Naomi, everyone knows there's not a selfish bone in your body, no matter-" He stopped, looking as if he'd bitten his tongue.</p><p>So that was what someone had been saying, once she'd left the kitchen. Well, she wouldn't put Isaiah in the middle by noticing.</p><p>"I guess the first thing is to find a place for my beehives," she said, deliberately turning the subject. "It's not going to be an easy job, moving them all."</p><p>"I'll help," he said instantly. "And I was thinking that I should ask Nathan King if you could have them on his farm. With Libby and me living right on the property, I could keep an eye on things for you."</p><p>Naomi hesitated. Isaiah enjoyed working for Nathan King on his dairy farm, and she didn't want to cause any difficulties between them by asking for something Nathan might not be so eager to grant. Nathan could have plenty of reasons not to want her beehives on his property.</p><p>"I wonder if that's wise," she said, careful to keep her voice neutral. "Ada and I were such close friends, and Nathan still mourns her so deeply even after two years. He might not want to have me around, reminding him of her."</p><p>Vertical lines formed between Isaiah's brows. "It's true he's still grieving for Ada. But as for reminding him . . . well, he seems to be thinking about her all the time anyway."</p><p>"Poor Nathan," she murmured. And poor Ada, gone far too early, it seemed, in such a freak accident, leaving Nathan and two young kinder behind. Naomi accepted it as God's will, but she couldn't help wishing it had been otherwise. As for Nathan-well, she doubted he would ever be able to accept his loss.</p><p>Isaiah straightened, pushing away from the tree. "Let me talk to Nathan about it, anyway. I won't push. I'll make it easy for him to say no, if that's what he's of a mind to do. But he might well say yes."</p><p>She was still doubtful, but she nodded. "I guess it can't hurt to ask."</p><p>"That's right. And if he says no, we'll find someone else." Isaiah put his arm around her shoulders. "You're cold. Let's go inside."</p><p>She hung back. "That's not a gut idea. Daadi will just start trying to persuade me again, and I don't want to provoke a family quarrel on my birthday." Although maybe she'd already done that very thing.</p><p>"He won't say a word." Isaiah sounded confident. "Betty told him it was best to let you think about their marriage and get used to the idea of moving out without him pushing you."</p><p>"And he agreed to that?" It didn't sound like Daadi at all. Once he'd made up his mind, he was like a rock.</p><p>"He did." Isaiah grinned, blue eyes twinkling. "Seems like Betty can manage him better than the rest of us put together. So don't lose heart. This is all going to turn out for the best, you'll see."</p><p>Naomi nodded as they started toward the house, not wanting to lay her burdens any more heavily on Isaiah. But she doubted this situation could possibly turn out for the best . . . for her, anyway.</p></p><h2>Honestly, We Meant Well: A Novel</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This rollicking book has it all: sex, lies, and scenery.

Catalogue of Women. Other Fragments (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Hesiod describes himself as a Boeotian shepherd who heard the Muses call upon him to sing about the gods. His exact dates are unknown, but he has often been considered a younger contemporary of Homer.</p><p>The first volume of this revised Loeb Classical Library edition offers Hesiod&#x2019;s two extant poems and a generous selection of testimonia regarding his life, works, and reception. In <i>Theogony</i>, Hesiod charts the history of the divine world, narrating the origin of the universe and the rise of the gods, from first beginnings to the triumph of Zeus, and reporting on the progeny of Zeus and of goddesses in union with mortal men. In <i>Works and Days</i>, Hesiod shifts his attention to humanity, delivering moral precepts and practical advice regarding agriculture, navigation, and many other matters; along the way he gives us the myths of Pandora and of the Golden, Silver, and other Races of Men.</p><p>The second volume contains <i>The Shield</i> and extant fragments of other poems, including the <i>Catalogue of Women</i>, that were attributed to Hesiod in antiquity. The former provides a Hesiodic counterpoint to the shield of Achilles in the <i>Iliad</i>; the latter presents several legendary episodes organized according to the genealogy of their heroes&#x2019; mortal mothers. None of these is now thought to be by Hesiod himself, but all have considerable literary and historical interest.</p><p>Glenn W. Most has thoroughly revised his edition to take account of the textual and interpretive scholarship that has appeared since its initial publication.</p></p><p><p>Glenn W. Most is Professor of Greek Philology, Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, and Professor of Social Thought, University of Chicago.</p>&#x201c;In the stimulating introduction to his new Loeb Classics two-volume edition of Hesiod, Glenn Most makes the case that we, too, should admire Hesiod for his powerful and unified worldview...The vast questions that are addressed in these poems--the origins of the gods, the way the world works, the reasons why things are as they are--can be seen as the first rumblings of natural science, physics, philosophy, theology, medicine, autobiography, agriculture, law, even history and textual criticism...Hesiod is our oldest source for many of the best-known and best-loved stories of Greek mythology...The disturbing moral complexity of the Hesiodic poems is all the more reason why we should continue to read and study them...No other modern English translation includes the fragmentary works or the ancient testimonia. If you already have some familiarity with Hesiod's two best-known works and you want to know more about the rest of the Hesiodic corpus and about the ancient reception of this canonical figure, then Most's new Loeb books will be essential. Most makes various important corrections and improvements in his translation...We may look back to Hesiod's poetry as representative of a cultural Golden Age when it was possible for a single work of literature to encompass the whole of traditional 'wisdom': high and low, ancient and modern, philosophical and poetic, practical and metaphysical. Perhaps even our Age of Iron could learn from him.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Emily Wilson</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b></p><h2>It Could Always Be Worse</h2><p>Once upon a time a poor unfortunate man lived with his mother, his wife, and his six children in a one-room hut.Because they were so crowded, the children often fought and the man and his wife argued.

Can you find them?</p><p></p><h2>Working with Wool: A Coast Salish Legacy and the Cowichan Sweater</h2><p>Cowichan sweaters, with their distinctive bands of design and untreated, handspun wool, have been a British Columbia icon since the early years of the twentieth century, but few people know the full story behind the garment. Now Sylvia Olsen tells the tale, drawing on her own experience, academic research, and her four-decade friendship with some of the Coast Salish women who have each knitted hundreds of sweaters. The sweaters appeared in the early 1900s, but the Coast Salish people have had a wool-working tradition for hundreds of years. Sylvia describes the ingeniously woven blankets, made with mountain goat wool and the hair of little white wool dogs, that caught the eye of the first Spanish and British visitors to the west coast. These blankets were valued trade items and also held a non-material, almost mystical, importance in Coast Salish culture. As European settlers began to populate Vancouver Island, the Coast Salish woolworkers learned from the newcomers how to knit and soon developed their unique sweaters, warm and water-proof for the B.C. environment yet attractive, fashionable, and ultimately popular around the world. Sylvia shows how the story of the sweater and its knitters reflects the history of the Coast Salish people in twentieth-century Canada. The knitters experienced grinding poverty, destructive racism, government paternalism, and cultural appropriation, but they battled back, using their sweaters to survive and to disprove the stereotypes that excluded them from the mainstream society and economy. As Sylvia says, This story is a small contribution to our collective identity. It speaks of the heart and soul of many people, their lifeblood and passion. It is a story of government officials who promoted the sweaters, merchants who sold them, and people who bought them and wore them with pride. The sweaters introduce readers to the Coast Salish people, especially the Coast Salish women who have always been hard workers, but who have also always loved creating and working with wool.</p><p>Sylvia Olsen married a Coast Salish man when she was seventeen and moved to Tsartlip First Nation. She was immediately struck by the ingenuity Coast Salish women displayed in their production of Cowichan sweaters, which soon became Sylvia&#39;s passion. She operated a Cowichan sweater shop for sixteen years on the reserve. From there she marketed the sweaters locally and abroad until the early 1990s, when the markets began to disappear and the once-booming industry faded. Sylvia then returned to university, making the Coast Salish knitters the subject of her master s thesis; the theme of a National Film Board documentary, The Story of the Coast Salish Knitters; and the topic of a picture book, Yetsa&#39;s Sweater. The sweaters became, for me, a symbol of our collective history in this province of British Columbia, Sylvia says. They represent not just my life, that of an immigrant in an indigenous community, but all of our lives, Coast Salish and settlers alike. The Cowichan sweater story, to me, is a tale, a collective history, about how diverse people converged to create a unique and truly amazing sweater, and how the sweater affected the people who shared that history. Sylvia Olsen is the author of twelve books for young people, most recently Counting On Hope, historical fiction set on British Columbia&#39;s west coast, which was nominated for the BC Book Prize in Children&#39;s Literature. She lives in North Saanich, near Victoria, British Columbia.</p><h2>Origami Architecture: Papercraft Models of the World's Most Famous Buildings: Origami Book with 16 Projects &amp; Instructional DVD</h2><p><b>Build detailed and impressive models of world landmarks with this beautiful origami book.</b><br><br>The incredible splendors of some of the worlds' most recognized architectural feats are brought to life within the pages of <i>Origami Architecture</i>.

In its heyday, the strip&#x2019;s spunky redheaded heroine, plucked from a Dickensian orphanage by kindly millionaire Daddy Warbucks, proved irresistible to mainstream America. The initial three years of daily episodes collected here have a mostly humorous tone. In subsequent decades, Gray would lead the cast on darker adventures that were vehicles for his conservative, pro-business politics. Like many early-twentieth-century strips, Annie was at first primitively drawn. Unlike most of his peers, Gray never totally shed that initial crudeness, which, in tandem with his equally rough politics, guaranteed the bluntness that gave Annie much of its distinctive charm. Gray had the foresight to hold on to nearly all his original drawings, so that they were available for this attractively designed volume that includes an invaluable biographical essay by comics scholar Jeet Heer. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Recreating Your Self: Building Self-Esteem Through Imaging and Self-Hypnosis</h2><p><p><strong>"This compelling and considerate guide very gently yet powerfully shows the adult child how to develop a strong and solid sense of self."&#x2015;Emily J.

The story in this book was extracted by <b>Major Ganis</b> from Skorzeny&#x2019;s personal papers. The evidence reveals that Skorzeny gradually and methodically became involved in US intelligence and covert operations during the Cold War. But Skorzeny&#x2019;s network had a greater point of destiny in November 1963, when it was utilized to carry out the most tragic mission in history. <br><br>This story would have been lost had Skorzeny not kept meticulous records of his businesses and contacts, which were fronts for US covert activity.

Memories, like myths, lie&#x2014;rounding or sharpening the edges of events so as to embellish or settle scores. It is where fact and fiction blend, evolving into a narrative we can live with.<br> <br>The day is November 23, 1963. It is a cold morning. My immigrant father is backing up his large Chevrolet Bel Air out of the garage. I get in as the car idles and he and I sit in silence until the temperature gauge reaches the level my father always thought appropriate for automotive maintenance. I recall a slow drive where the images outside the fogged windows seemed dreamlike, unreal and yet real enough to disturb a small boy. We were driving on Austin Avenue past the Chinese laundry and Wagon Wheel diner. There was the Patio Theater, where just a week before I had seen a film starring Gary Cooper. The theater&#x2019;s grand fa�ade was lit up with its sparkling lights, its marquee announcing John Wayne and James Stewart in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The movie palace glittered, untouched by all that had happened, and that provided a strange comfort.<br> <br>Many times during that drive I turned to look at my father but he was far away and lost, traveling in silence down familiar streets with leafless trees, paralyzed by events and a sorrow that, even as a boy, I sensed would last forever. It was in that slow-motion car that I learned that no one gets over anything.<br> <br>The day before, John F. Kennedy, the thirty-fifth president of the United States, was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, and in a small room in a Chicago apartment my mother died. She had been ill for some time but my father always held out hope that by force of will he could save her. On November 22, that was but one of the many illusions that were shattered.<br> <br>The television seemed to be on all the time that day, and the black-and-white pictures and solemn voices kept up a guarded hope that finally ended with Walter Cronkite holding back tears, taking off his glasses and reporting the time of President Kennedy&#x2019;s death. So many people have told me that they remembered exactly where they were when they heard the news. I do not. What I remember is looking through the windows of my father&#x2019;s car on the next day and seeing people grieving in unexpected ways. The man raking his yard when there were no leaves or the woman walking quickly with her bag of groceries suddenly stopping, looking as if she had forgotten something, before sitting on a bus bench. All the faces, none with smiles, heads bowed. To a small boy it was so confusing because it felt like they were grieving for my mother as well as the president. I cannot remember if my mother died before or after the president&#x2019;s assassination. I suppose it doesn&#x2019;t matter and if it did, it would be easy enough to know by looking at her death certificate, but I have never been able to do that, for I too reside within the narrative that I can live with.<br> <br> <br>HEMINGWAY FAMILY PORTRAIT TAKEN ON THE WAY HOME FROM WINDEMERE IN AUGUST 1909.

KENNEDY PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM, BOSTON.<br><br>Our destination on November 23 was Oak Park, where some relatives lived. In that grand, wood-paneled home, some of the old Greek women, dressed in their most depressing black, clung to rosaries that occupied their hands but gave little comfort. Occasionally they would pause, kiss me and hold my hand. We were all locked in an impenetrable sorrow, and no one knew what to say until an uncle told me that just a few blocks away a great American writer had grown up. It was the first time that I heard the name Ernest Hemingway.<br> <br>As a young man, I, like so many others, went through my &#x201c;Hemingway&#x201d; period. I read the books and was excited by the worlds he described and became hungry for life&#x2019;s adventures. I left home at seventeen and began traveling the world in search of those experiences and a hoped-for knowledge that might be acquired along the way. I traveled to Spain and ran with the bulls and then on to Paris to visit some of Hemingway&#x2019;s haunts, but he was nowhere to be found in those commercialized temples that had a &#x201c;George Washington slept here&#x201d; quality to them. He was where he had always been, in his books.<br> <br>As a result of that understanding I quickly grew tired of the Hemingway legend and realized that the man&#x2019;s greatness lay in the work and not in his lifestyle, though the two were often intertwined. The more I learned the more I understood how disciplined and dedicated he had been to his craft and how hard he struggled to put words on a page. He may have been, as some said, a genius, but that did not mean he had discovered a shortcut to hard work.<br> <br>A number of years ago, while working as editor on a book entitled Sacred Trusts, I contacted a number of writers, soliciting essays for the volume. I had read something about Africa written by Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s middle son, Patrick, that I thought very good and wrote a detailed letter to him, not only about my hope at his possible participation, but of my experiences since leaving Chicago. A few weeks later I received a lovely letter in reply.<br> <br>It was, as Bogart said to Claude Rains in Casablanca, the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Within a short period of time and ahead of schedule, Patrick sent me his essay &#x201c;The Elephants of Tsavo.&#x201d; It was beautifully written, heartbreaking and sadly prescient. After the book&#x2019;s release I received a call from Patrick inviting me to Montana. My late wife, Kris, and I drove to Bozeman from Philadelphia and spent three days with Patrick and Carol Hemingway that were filled with laughter and wonderful conversations that danced from literature and science to mathematics, politics and religion. A short time after our return, Patrick called again and asked if I would be interested in managing his father&#x2019;s literary estate. To say the least, I was taken aback.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not a manager,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get the hang of it, pal, and it won&#x2019;t take up much time so you&#x2019;ll have time for your own writing and work,&#x201d; Patrick answered.<br> <br>I remember declining, twice, but Patrick was persuasive. Over the last nineteen years I have had the pleasure not only of Patrick&#x2019;s company, but of the remarkable stories and remembrances that seem to fill every hour that we have been together. I have learned much from Patrick about his father and, as one would expect, the story is far more nuanced and detailed than myth allows.<br> <br>The myth of Hemingway, some of which he created himself, is too simplistic. It is the he-man tough guy who drinks hard and gets the women while talking in a clipped fashion suggesting a world-weary cynicism arrived at from war, betrayal and broken hearts. This was the beginning of his style or, more accurately, his use of the Kansas City Star&#x2019;s style sheet that he was given in 1917 while working there as a reporter. The style sheet&#x2019;s number one rule was &#x201c;Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English.&#x201d; Some of the other rules would stimulate Hemingway into constructing sentences of fiction in a revolutionary way that seemed utterly new. &#x201c;Avoid the use of adjectives,&#x201d; proclaimed one of the rules, and then, &#x201c;eliminate every superfluous word.&#x201d;<br> <br>What Hemingway did caught on. After the release and success of The Sun Also Rises, people would travel to Paris imitating the book&#x2019;s characters. They would sit at caf�s like the D�me and La Rotonde in Montparnasse, putting on their best Brett and Jake personas, and not just in Paris, but in cities on both sides of the Atlantic.<br> <br>In the public&#x2019;s imagination Hemingway had become not merely a successful writer, but also a trendsetter. The word trendsetter, by its own implication, suggests something momentarily in fashion that passes and is finally rendered clich�. Some people may have thought that about Hemingway at the time but not many. Others, like Donald Ogden Stewart, were confused by The Sun&#x2019;s success, believing it to be nothing more than straight reporting about a contentious time between friends at a festival in Spain, which Stewart had been part of.<br> <br>There are so many competing layers of myth concerning Hemingway that it seems at times impossible to see the man. But when Hemingway is looked at through his own words, at different stages of his life, and through some of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most tumultuous events, the story becomes far more deep and interesting. That is why the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library is an invaluable resource in understanding Hemingway as an artist and a human being and how the life he lived informed his work.<br> <br>Patrick Hemingway once told me that his father did not keep a journal but did keep everything else and did so as an aid to memory. The Hemingway Collection is a scrapbook of one of the world&#x2019;s most influential and enduring writers and a rollicking trip through the twentieth century.<br> <br> <br>COPYRIGHT JFK LIBRARY.<br><br> <br>PORTRAIT OF ERNEST HEMINGWAY.

PHOTOGRAPHER OFFICIALLY UNKNOWN. PAPERS OF HEMINGWAY COLLECTION, JOHN F. KENNEDY PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM, BOSTON.<br><br>The many artifacts in the collection are his, and they tell a story of what he liked and valued. The thousands of letters he wrote present a funny nickname maker, a good and loyal friend, a loving father, an attentive brother and son, a competitive and jealous man and sometimes a cruel one.<br> <br>While exploring Hemingway&#x2019;s life through his words and things, something has become very clear, and that is his powers of observation. Hemingway was making lists all the time, seemingly listening to and watching everything and storing it away to be used at some future date. One photograph that I discovered, which I believe he probably took while fishing in Cuba, shows the seeds of what years later will become The Old Man and the Sea. The photograph shows two old fishermen on a small boat with a short, single sail. Alongside the boat they are hauling up a large swordfish. The image is a fine one, executed with an understanding of composition and timing. He was paying attention. Close attention.<br> <br>Unlike in this current age where people are recording everything and seeing nothing, Hemingway was taking life in, and he was doing so from a very young age. On June 9, 1909, age ten, Hemingway writes to his sister Marcelline in a straightforward storytelling style:<br> <br>Dear Marc,<br> <br>Our Room was in the field day against Miss Koontz room. Al Bersham knocked two of Chandlers teeth out in a scrap and your dear gentle Miss hood had Mr. Smith hold him while she lickt him with a raw hide strap.<br> <br>Lovingly,<br> <br>Ernest<br> <br>Hemingway lived in an analog world, not a digital one. He traveled by ship, train and car and in planes, not jets, at least not in the beginning, and yet there he is, seemingly everywhere. World War I in Italy, Spain, Africa, Cuba, Key West, New York, the Spanish Civil War. Back to Italy, Paris as a young man, Paris as an old man, China, Sun Valley, Chicago, Wyoming and Germany. With Mussolini, with Cooper, Dietrich and Capa. He&#x2019;s fishing, hunting and running with the bulls and writing, always writing. There is one wife, a child, then another wife, two more children, another wife and one more after that. He is there, with Picasso and Fitzgerald, Stein, Joyce and Pound, with generals and old fishermen. He&#x2019;s in World War II, then the Ritz, Orwell and Salinger and on and on. Yes, Hemingway seemed to be everywhere, but the age he lived in, its pace at the start of the century, was conducive to poets and observers. Hemingway was suited to the early twentieth century and was spared &#x201c;that agent of superficiality&#x201d; that Peter Fleming declared was modern plane travel.<br> <br>There are over eleven thousand photographs, bullfighting tickets and scraps of paper with lists of what books a struggling writer should read. There are airline, train and steamship tickets that are so lovely they seem a page from an illuminated manuscript and demonstrate how much beauty there once was in the artifacts of daily commercial exchanges. As I went through his things I realized how much tactile aesthetic has been sacrificed and replaced with a severe digital practicality.<br> <br>There are the letters, thousands of them, from the JFK and other collections, that record the goings-on in his and his friends&#x2019; lives. Receipts from bookstores in New York, Paris and Spain revealing what he was reading and when. The telegram from Senator John F. Kennedy asks Mr. Hemingway about his definition of courage as Kennedy works on his own book that will become the 1957 Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning Profiles in Courage. Years later, another telegram from the now young president-elect to the Mayo Clinic, where Hemingway was undergoing shock treatment, asking him to be at his inaugural followed by the heartbreaking and repeated drafts of a response that Hemingway attempts to write six months prior to his suicide. Those drafts, in his struggling hand, reveal the end of things because in spite of all of his passions, it was writing that sustained him.<br> <br>There are materials stamped &#x201c;Restricted,&#x201d; one by the command of General Dwight Eisenhower, which had me wonder if Hemingway had access to classified information during World War II. Interesting, seeing that he was a reporter. Or was he? More treasure for future researchers.<br> <br>There are two receipts for checks written by Hemingway in the amounts of $750 each that were for the custom-made ambulance that he was contributing to the Spanish Civil War effort with the accompanying list of how the ambulance should be constructed and what it should contain. One can see the connection between what he learned as an ambulance driver in World War I and what he was asking for in 1937.<br> <br>Traveling through Hemingway&#x2019;s artifacts, I have come to recognize the man, his early hopes and dreams, his determination to be one of the &#x201c;great writers,&#x201d; his fears of physical and mental illness and, finally, death. Like him I am from the Midwest, Chicago, and I identify with the hungry young man who was determined to take on the world, and who, at a young age, was already too big for Oak Park&#x2019;s quiet Sundays and perfect lawns.<br> <br>The letters of Hemingway to friends and relatives while he was recuperating from his war wounds in Italy were of particular interest.

He&#x2019;s the cat next door, the one whose bathroom habits have always been questionable and whose attention is perpetually trained on the potted flowers on my front porch.</p><p>Until that afternoon, that is.</p><p>That day, Jerry bypassed the flowers and went straight for the wicker couch on the porch, the one where, until the phone rang inside the B and B, I&#x2019;d been reading Marianne&#x2019;s manuscript because she wanted one more set of eyes to take a look before she sent it off to a small academic press that specializes in local history. Yeah, that was the couch where I&#x2019;d left the pages neatly stacked and&#x2014;this is vital to the telling of the story&#x2014;completely dry and odor-free.</p><p>Jerry, see, had motive, means, and opportunity.</p><p>Jerry had mayhem in his kitty cat heart, and at the risk of sounding just the teeniest bit paranoid, I was pretty sure Jerry had it out for me, too.</p><p>It was the perfect storm of circumstance and timing, and the results were so predictable, I shouldn&#x2019;t have walked back out onto the porch, taken one look at the puddle quickly soaking through Marianne&#x2019;s tidy manuscript pages, and stood, pikestaffed, with my mouth hanging open.</p><p>Jerry, it should be pointed out, could not have cared less. In fact, I think he enjoyed watching my jaw flap in the breeze that blew from Lake Erie across the street. But then, Jerry&#x2019;s that kind of cat. He leapt onto the porch railing, paused to give one paw a lick, and looked over his shoulder at me with what I would call disdain if I weren&#x2019;t convinced it was more devious than that.</p><p>A second later, he bounded into the yard and disappeared, leaving me to watch in horror as the liquid disaster spread. From the manuscript to the purple and turquoise floral print cushions. From the cushions to the wicker couch. From the couch to the porch floor.</p><p>Oh yes, at the time, it did seem like the worst of all possible disasters.</p><p>But then, that was my first October on South Bass Island and I had yet to hear about the legend.</p><p>Or the ghost.</p><p>And there was no way I could have imagined the murder.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>&#x201c;Visit from Jerry?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t realize Luella Zak had walked up the steps and onto the porch until I heard her behind me. I shrieked and spun around just in time to see her eye the smelly disaster.</p><p>&#x201c;I was only gone two minutes,&#x201d; I wailed. &#x201c;I swear. It was only two minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Jerry managed to stop by.&#x201d; Luella is captain of a fishing charter service that works out of Put-in-Bay, the one and only town on South Bass Island. She&#x2019;s short, wiry, and as crusty an old thing (don&#x2019;t tell her I said that about the old) as any sailor who plied any of the Great Lakes, but when she stepped nearer to have a look at the mess, she wrinkled her nose.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope those papers were nothing you planned on keeping,&#x201d; Luella said.</p><p>The reality of the situation dawned with all the subtlety of a dump truck bumpety-bumping over railroad tracks, and I shook out of my daze and darted to the couch. Before I even thought about what it would do to my green sweatshirt and my jeans, I scooped up the pile of yellow-stained pages and shook them out.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Marianne&#x2019;s manuscript,&#x201d; I groaned. &#x201c;Marianne asked me to look for typos and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Luella didn&#x2019;t say a word. In fact, she ducked into the house, and a minute later, she was back with a garbage bag in hand.</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Cat pee dripped off my hands and rained onto my sneakers, but still, I refused to relinquish the soggy manuscript. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t throw it away. I promised Marianne&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Careful to keep it from dripping on her Carhartt bib overalls, Luella snatched the bundle away from me and deposited it in the bag. &#x201c;Marianne can reprint it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But if I tell her to do that, I&#x2019;ll have to explain&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what, you&#x2019;re going to take this back to her?&#x201d; Luella hefted the garbage bag. &#x201c;And you think she won&#x2019;t notice the stains? Or the smell?&#x201d;</p><p>My shoulders drooped. &#x201c;I think I need to find a way to tell her I&#x2019;m really, really sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Luella thought about clapping a hand to my shoulder and I could tell when she changed her mind because she made a face and backed away. But then, I was standing downwind. &#x201c;I hate to tell you this, Bea, but I think that you smell really bad.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t doubt it for a minute, but really, there were more important things to consider. &#x201c;Poor Marianne. All that work and all that paper and now she&#x2019;ll need do it all over again. Printing out an entire book takes a lot of time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Marianne wrote a book?&#x201d; The instant I looked her way, Luella was contrite. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m doubting how smart she is or anything. She&#x2019;s a good librarian. But Marianne doesn&#x2019;t exactly strike me as the type who&#x2019;d have enough imagination to write a book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s history. Island history. I didn&#x2019;t get more than a couple pages into it, but I know it&#x2019;s about some old-timer, Charles Harlow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sleepy!&#x201d; Luella laughed. &#x201c;Well, that explains it. Word is that Marianne&#x2019;s family is distantly related. I&#x2019;d bet a dime to a donut she devotes at least one chapter to trying to disprove that. Sleepy has quite a reputation around here, and it&#x2019;s not exactly politically correct for the wife of the town magistrate to be related to an old-time gangster and bootlegger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I dunno.&#x201d; My shoulders rose and fell. &#x201c;I mean about the gangster part. I never got that far. I&#x2019;d just started reading and then the phone rang and then&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jerry.&#x201d; Luella shook her head. &#x201c;Chandra really needs to do something about that cat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been saying that for nearly a year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk to Chandra,&#x201d; Luella promised. &#x201c;Next Monday at book discussion group. And as far as Marianne, maybe if you just explain what Jerry did&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I dreaded the thought. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s so proud of her book. You should have seen her when she brought the manuscript over here. She was just about bursting at the seams.&#x201d; My stomach swooped. &#x201c;She asked for one little favor and I messed up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not the end of the world. She&#x2019;ll reprint, you&#x2019;ll reread&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Inside the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Inside the house. And then&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>And then three black SUVs slowed in front of the house and, one by one, turned into my driveway.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got guests coming in today?&#x201d; Luella asked.</p><p>I did, a full house, and what with the manuscript disaster and fantasizing about the ingenious (and completely untraceable) demise of a certain feline neighbor, I&#x2019;d forgotten all about them.</p><p>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; Luella shooed me into the house. &#x201c;You go change. And a quick shower wouldn&#x2019;t hurt, either. I&#x2019;ll let your guests in and get them settled and tell them you&#x2019;ll be with them pronto.&#x201d;</p><p>OK, so it wasn&#x2019;t exactly pronto, but I did manage what I hoped was a less smelly transformation in record time. When I was done, curly, dark hair damp and in a clean pair of jeans and a yellow long-sleeved top (dang, I didn&#x2019;t even make the Jerry Garcia and yellow connection until it was too late!), I lifted my chin, pasted a smile on my face, and strode into my parlor.</p><p>Straight into what looked like the staging for D-day.</p><p>Two women, two guys. Another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I glanced out the window and counted the men on my front porch. Another four out there. Each one of them carried at least two duffel bags or a suitcase or a camera of some sort, and each one of those was plastered with bumper sticker&#x2013;variety labels. Black, emblazoned with icy blue letters: <i>EGG</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome!&#x201d; I tried for my best innkeeper smile and thanked whatever lucky stars had made it possible for Luella to take a few moments and swab down the front porch; through the window, I saw that the floral cushions were missing from the couch, and the water she&#x2019;d splashed on the porch floor gleamed in the autumn afternoon sunshine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Bea, your hostess. You must be&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;EGG.&#x201d; The woman closest to where I stood in the doorway was at least a half dozen years older than my thirty-five, and taller than me by six inches. She was square-jawed, dark-haired, pear-shaped, and more than equipped for whatever situation might present itself. The pockets of her camouflage pants bulged, and the vest she wore over a black EGG T-shirt was one of those that fishermen sometimes sport. It had a dozen little pockets, and I saw batteries, flash drives, and other assorted gear peeking out of each one.</p><p>&#x201c;Noreen Turner. I&#x2019;m lead investigator for EGG, the Elkhart Ghost Getters.&#x201d; When Noreen pumped my hand, it felt as if my fingers had been gripped by a vise. Her dark gaze stayed steady on mine in a firm&#x2014;and sort of disquieting&#x2014;way. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the leader of this jolly little band, and&#x2014;&#x201d; She must have had first-class peripheral vision, because though I hadn&#x2019;t even noticed the activity going on over in the direction of the fireplace, Noreen didn&#x2019;t miss a thing.</p><p>She whirled toward a young, redheaded woman, and a muscle jumped at the base of her jaw.</p><p>&#x201c;Thermal camera, full spectrum camera, Mel meter, IR light.&#x201d; Noreen&#x2019;s laser gaze flashed from the redhead to the cases of equipment she was busy stacking. &#x201c;Really, Fiona? Really?&#x201d;</p><p>Fiona&#x2019;s cheeks shot through with color. She chewed her lower lip. &#x201c;I thought&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly your problem.&#x201d; Noreen marched over, unstacked the equipment, and, fists on hips, gave it all a careful look. &#x201c;Thermal camera on the bottom,&#x201d; she said, setting that case down on the floor first. &#x201c;Then the Mel meter on top of that.&#x201d; The case with the thermal camera in it was larger than the one that contained the Mel meter, and she set the second case on top of the first, adjusting and readjusting so that the second case was exactly in the center. &#x201c;Then full spectrum, then IR light.&#x201d; She positioned those cases until they were just right, too, and, finished, she turned her full attention on Fiona, who held her breath and looked as if she was about to burst into tears. &#x201c;You see what I&#x2019;m getting at here, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Fiona didn&#x2019;t answer fast enough, and Noreen lifted her chin and took a step toward her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you? Top to bottom, kid. Top to bottom. IR on top, then full spectrum, then Mel, then&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The oldest of the men in the room (I&#x2019;d learn later that his name was Rick) was maybe fifty, a reed-thin guy with a receding hairline and a gold stud in his right earlobe. He stood closest to Fiona and he leaned in like he wanted to share a confidence, but since he didn&#x2019;t lower his voice, whatever he had to say wasn&#x2019;t much of a secret. &#x201c;She wants it alphabetical,&#x201d; he rasped. &#x201c;She always has to have equipment stacked alphabetically.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s easy to find what we need,&#x201d; Noreen snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d; The man waved a hand and turned his back on us to look out the window.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it makes sense. And it&#x2019;s the right way to do things. You can see that, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; She swiveled her gaze to me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a businesswoman. You can see the sense of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Fortunately, I didn&#x2019;t have a chance to answer. One of the men who&#x2019;d been on the front porch came into the house pushing a two-wheeler with a big rectangular box on it. He parked the two-wheeler in the hallway before he joined us in the parlor. The man was about my age, with black, wavy hair and the kind of face generally reserved for statues of Greek gods. Dimpled chin, straight nose, high cheekbones. A picture flashed through my mind: Mediterranean island, whitewashed cottage, aquamarine water. A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t ask you to bring that in.&#x201d;</p><p>Noreen&#x2019;s growl yanked me back to reality, and I found her glaring at Mr. Greek God. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not ready for it,&#x201d; she said, and pointed toward the box, which was maybe three feet high and another couple feet wide. Like the rest of the gear, it was plastered with EGG stickers. &#x201c;I told you to leave it in the truck, Dimitri. That means&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, duh, I dunno. I guess it means you should have left it in the truck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said you wanted it in your room with you,&#x201d; the man sucked in a breath and shot back. &#x201c;And that means&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What it means is that you&#x2019;re not listening. When I&#x2019;m ready for it, that&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;ll tell you to bring it in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In like, what, ten minutes?&#x201d; Dimitri ran a hand through his mane of glorious hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you what, Noreen, you want it back in the truck, you take it back to the truck. I&#x2019;m not moving it another inch. Not now, not ten minutes from now.

If it wasn&#x2019;t for me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Was that a collective groan I heard?</p><p>From everyone but Fiona, who was so ashen I had no doubt she wanted to fade into the woodwork.</p><p>And Noreen, of course. With a look, Noreen dared them all to say another word.</p><p>We&#x2019;d been introduced like three minutes earlier and already I knew Noreen wasn&#x2019;t the type of person who backed down from anyone. Or anything.</p><p>Fine by me. I wasn&#x2019;t, either.</p><p>And it was about time I proved it.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got all your rooms set and your room keys ready,&#x201d; I said, deftly sidestepping their bickering. I darted into the hallway and grabbed the keys I&#x2019;d left on a table at the bottom of the stairs. &#x201c;Each one&#x2019;s marked,&#x201d; I said, handing them around. &#x201c;All the rooms are on the second floor.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d received room instructions along with the group&#x2019;s reservations and I knew that the only two guys bunking together were Ben and Eddie. Since I had six guest rooms, that meant Noreen and Dimitri each had their own room as well as the other three men, who, according to their reservations forms, were Liam McCarthy, David Ashton, and Rick Hopkins.</p><p>&#x201c;I know. That leaves me with no room.&#x201d; Fiona Blake watched as the others stacked their equipment cases (alphabetically, I presumed) and headed upstairs. She scraped her palms against her jeans. &#x201c;Noreen&#x201d;&#x2014;her gaze darted across the room to where Noreen was doing another once-over of the equipment and checking off a list on a clipboard&#x2014;&#x201c;Noreen told me I wouldn&#x2019;t be staying here. That there aren&#x2019;t enough rooms. You don&#x2019;t have to apologize.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to.&#x201d; I softened the statement with a smile and would have gotten one back if Fiona&#x2019;s gaze didn&#x2019;t shoot Noreen&#x2019;s way again.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like I didn&#x2019;t know you were coming,&#x201d; I told the kid. &#x201c;Ms. Turner told me you&#x2019;d need a room. I&#x2019;ve got everything arranged.&#x201d;</p><p>Fiona squinched up her nose in a way that told me that whatever I was going to say, she had heard it all before. &#x201c;I know, some little no-tell motel on the other side of the island. That&#x2019;s fine, really. I&#x2019;m used to it. It&#x2019;s not always possible for me to stay with the rest of the crew. I get it.&#x201d; Her gaze landed on Noreen, who was so busy restacking the equipment the others had just stacked, she didn&#x2019;t notice. &#x201c;I just joined the group and I&#x2019;m only the intern and I don&#x2019;t rate the same perks the rest of the crew gets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which doesn&#x2019;t mean you shouldn&#x2019;t be comfortable.&#x201d; I waved a hand, directing Fiona to look out the wi...</p></p><h2>You Are Your Instrument: the Definitive Musician&#39;s Guide to Practice and Performance</h2><p>(Fretted). This unique guide helps all musicians: open up new avenues of expression through a pain-free, healthy, fluid approach to music-making; overcome performance anxiety, general tension, and muscular injury; and increase learning skills and facilitate more effective motor coordination. &#34;This is a highly recommended book to read for the musician who needs information about maximizing one&#39;s full potential as an artist. This book is practical in that it covers all aspects of musicianship, ranging from the mental preparations involved in performance to the actual bodily care needed to prevent long-term injuries.&#34; BOOK REVIEW</p><p>This book was turned by 45 publishers in the 1980s because no publisher understood the importance of the topic. The then president of NYC&#39;s musician&#39;s union loaned the author the money to publish it and the first printing sold out before it had come back from the printer, necessitating 10 mini-loans to order a second printing. It is now in its seventh printing!After suffering from injuries playing the violin in the late 1970&#39;s, I could not find a single health professional trained in the problems particular to repetitive muscle use. I worked on this book for ten years with the help of medical editors, injured musicians, and avid supporters. The biggest opposition came from doctors who felt that I had no right to learn and know anything about how my body works! The whole point of the book is that musicians use their bodies as strenuously as dancers and athletes, and we do have a right to understand basic muscle and joint function as well as post-practice care. I&#39;m proud to say that to date, over 45 reviewers have given this book glowing reviews.

It was a horrific catastrophe, yet one which today is virtually forgotten.</p><p> With research gathered over more than two decades, award-winning writer and filmmaker Jon Wilkman revisits the deluge that claimed nearly five hundred lives. A key figure is William Mulholland, the self-taught engineer who created an unprecedented water system, allowing Los Angeles to become America's second-largest city, and who was also responsible for the design and construction of the St. Francis Dam.</p><p> Driven by eyewitness accounts and combining urban history with a life-and-death drama and a technological detective story, <i>Floodpath </i>grippingly reanimates the reality behind L.A. noir fictions such as the classic film <i>Chinatown</i>. In an era of climate change, increasing demand on water resources, and a neglected American infrastructure, the tragedy of the St. Francis Dam has never been more relevant.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2016:</strong> How does a man-made disaster that killed 500 innocents near a burgeoning metropolis become a historical footnote? In 1928, the St. Francis dam, part of William Mulholland&#x2019;s ambitious plan to siphon water to young Los Angeles, suddenly disintegrated, releasing a wall of water that obliterated everything in its path. The story has been told before, but Jon Wilkman is the first to separate the disaster from its larger, triumphant context. <em>Floodpath</em> applies Wilkman&#x2019;s skills as an award-winning documentarian, collecting first-hand accounts, contemporary reporting, and interviews with Mullholland&#x2019;s descendants--while eschewing the dramatic speculation that pads much recent &#x201c;narrative nonfiction&#x201d;--to produce a factual-yet-compelling account that still resonates today. --<em>Jon Foro</em><b>Jon Wilkman</b> is an award-winning documentary filmmaker.

Though we may laud wealthy individuals who give away their money for society&#x2019;s benefit, <i>Just Giving</i> shows how such generosity not only isn&#x2019;t the unassailable good we think it to be but might also undermine democratic values and set back aspirations of justice. Big philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable, often perpetual, and lavishly tax-advantaged. The affluent&#x2015;and their foundations&#x2015;reap vast benefits even as they influence policy without accountability. And small philanthropy, or ordinary charitable giving, can be problematic as well. Charity, it turns out, does surprisingly little to provide for those in need and sometimes worsens inequality.</p><p>These outcomes are shaped by the policies that define and structure philanthropy. When, how much, and to whom people give is influenced by laws governing everything from the creation of foundations and nonprofits to generous tax exemptions for donations of money and property. Rob Reich asks: What attitude and what policies should democracies have concerning individuals who give money away for public purposes? Philanthropy currently fails democracy in many ways, but Reich argues that it can be redeemed. Differentiating between individual philanthropy and private foundations, the aims of mass giving should be the decentralization of power in the production of public goods, such as the arts, education, and science. For foundations, the goal should be what Reich terms &#x201c;discovery,&#x201d; or long-time-horizon innovations that enhance democratic experimentalism. Philanthropy, when properly structured, can play a crucial role in supporting a strong liberal democracy.</p><p><i>Just Giving</i> investigates the ethical and political dimensions of philanthropy and considers how giving might better support democratic values and promote justice.</p></p><p><b>Rob Reich</b> is professor of political science and faculty codirector for the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University. His recent books include <i>Education, Justice, and Democracy</i>.<b>"Inside Philanthropy's Philanthropy Critic of 2018"</b><br><br>"Surveying philanthropy from ancient Athens to the modern-day Rockefeller Foundation, and political philosophers from John Stuart Mill to John Rawls, Stanford political science professor Reich . . . mounts a wide-ranging critique of charity and the government preferments that subsidize it. . . . A lucid, thought-provoking analysis of the public impact of charity." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Critics take aim at government policy when it fails, in their view, to sufficiently encourage donations to charity. In <i>Just Giving,</i> Rob Reich . . . argues that a more fundamental question needs to be asked: Why should government policies encourage philanthropy at all?"<b>---Leslie Lenkowsky, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"In this erudite study, Stanford University political philosopher Rob Reich quotes . . . gems from the history of ideas to explore what he calls the 'plutocratic bias' inherent in large-scale philanthropy today. He treats readers to rich insights from enlightenment philosophers onwards who have criticised the assumption that mega-giving from the mega-rich is something to celebrate."<b>---Linsey McGoey, <i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>"An instant classic."<b>---David Callahan, <i>Inside Philanthropy</i></b><br><br>"Reich judiciously weighs the philosophical pros and cons of tax-subsidised philanthropy."<b>---Edward Luce, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>"It is well-written with plenty of supporting evidence, and interesting philosophical discussions." (<i>Pennsylvania Literary Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Unlike most studies of charitable giving, which focus on an individual&#x2019;s motivations or proper objectives, Reich investigates philanthropy from the perspective of the state and society. He seeks to make it a compelling topic for political theory, and in this he succeeds admirably. Anyone engaged in serious philanthropy needs to wrestle with Reich&#x2019;s analysis, and all will be made&#x2015;appropriately&#x2015;uncomfortable by what he has to say.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Larry Kramer, president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</b><br><br>&#x201c;Rob Reich writes with the precision of a political scientist and the perceptiveness of a philosopher, and in <i>Just Giving</i> delivers an essential treatise on the role of philanthropy in our democracy. By combining history, theory, and even-handed critique, Reich challenges us to wield the power of giving for justice.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation </b><br><br>&#x201c;Everyone sees the impact of big donors on political campaigns&#x2015;but what about unelected big donors quietly experimenting with our schools and neighborhoods with taxpayer-subsidized money? In this revelatory, brilliantly argued book, Reich shows how crucial it is for a democracy to scrutinize philanthropy. Essential reading for anyone worried about money in politics.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Larissa MacFarquhar, author of <i>Strangers Drowning: Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, and the Urge to Help</i></b></p><h2>Code Name Verity</h2><p>&#39;I have two weeks.

In these pages, historian Clyde Ellis offers a compelling look at the way in which many Kiowas became Christian over the past century and have woven that faith into their identity. The personal and cultural significance of traditional songs and their close connection to the power of hymns is then illuminated by anthropologist Luke Eric Lassiter. Like traditional Kiowa songs, Christian hymns help restore and minister to the community; they also can be highly individualistic since many are composed and shared by church members themselves at different times in their lives. In the final section of the book Kiowa singer Ralph Kotay tells of the personal meaning and value of the hymns and of the Christian faith in general.</p><p>This remarkable, sensitive book makes an important contribution to our understanding of the complexity of Native lives today and offers a subtle yet penetrating look at the legacy of Christianity among Native peoples.</p></p><p>Luke Eric Lassiter is an associate professor of anthropology at Ball State University.

Ralph Kotay is a member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma and a noted singer whose work has been featured in a number of publications and recordings, including "Songs of Indian Territory" and "Remaining Ourselves: Music and Tribal Memory."After the Kiowas were forced onto government reservations in southwestern Oklahoma in the late 19th century, many of these nomadic Native American hunters adopted Christianity. Missionaries fostered native leadership, translated Scriptures into local languages, and encouraged the composition of indigenous hymns. Now few fluent speakers of Kiowa are left, and church services are conducted in English. Elders believe that when the hymns are no longer sung in Kiowa, a vital part of the language and spirituality will be lost. To prevent this cultural expression from disappearing, Kiowa elders, such as singer and hymnologist Ralph Kotay, are now making recordings and teaching classes in Kiowa hymn singing. In this collaborative work, anthropologist Lassiter (Ball State Univ.; Power of Kiowa Song), historian Clyde Ellis (Elon Univ.; To Change Them Forever), and Kotay examine the personal and cultural dimensions of the Kiowa Christian experience exemplified by these hymns. Ellis gives a historical overview of Kiowa Christianity on the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation, while Lassiter describes Kiowa churches and the role hymns play in tribal culture. In the final section, Kotay comments on the history and meaning of 26 hymns recorded on an accompanying CD (not heard). This important and well-researched study is recommended for collections in Native American religion and ethnomusicology. Lucille M.

It&#x2019;s nice to see that the women can be just as bloodthirsty as the men.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>He watches the women from the shadows. He has an understanding with them: As long as they follow his rules, they are safe. But when they sin, he sentences them to death.<br>&nbsp;<br>A woman is found dead in a cemetery, strangled and covered in plastic. Just a few days before her death, the victim had received a flower, an unintelligible note, and a photograph of herself. Detective Inspector Irene Huss and her colleagues on the Violent Crimes Unit in G�teborg, Sweden, have neither clue nor motive to pursue, and when similar murders follow, their search for the killer becomes increasingly desperate. Meanwhile, strange things have been going on at home for Irene: first the rose bush in her garden is mangled, then she receives a threatening package with no return address. Is Irene being paranoid, or is she next on the killer&#x2019;s list?</p><p>Helene Tursten was a nurse and a dentist before she turned to writing. Other books in the Irene Huss series include <i>Detective Inspector Huss</i>, <i>Night Rounds</i>, <i>The Torso</i>, <i>The Glass Devil</i>, <i>The Golden Calf</i>, <i>The Fire Dance</i>, <i>The Beige Man</i>, <i>The Treacherous Net</i>, and <i>Protected by the Shadows</i>. Her books have been translated into 18 languages and made into a television series. She was born in G�teborg, Sweden, where she now lives with her husband.Thin veils of mist lingered in the glow of the street lamps, but soon they would disperse completely. The gusts of wind were getting stronger all the time, carrying the first drops of rain. Dampness clung to her face as she leaned forward, fighting her way across the parking lot. Nobody was out and about without good reason; even the dog owners in the area seemed to have abandoned the idea of a last walk. The neighborhood was dark and silent; most people had already gone to bed. Only Bosse Gunnarsson&#x2019;s kitchen window showed a warm, inviting light. He was sitting at the table with a sudoku puzzle as usual, his reading glasses slipping down his nose.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her own house lay in darkness, but she would soon change that. Switch on the lamps, make a cup of tea, fix herself an egg and caviar sandwich. Light some candles on the coffee table. Wrap herself in a thick, soft blanket and watch the late news. Then off to bed, she promised herself. She reached into the mailbox: nothing but bills and flyers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued toward the door, searching in her purse for the key. As she was about to insert it in the lock, she noticed a rapid movement in the darkness by the shed. Suddenly someone was right behind her. An iron grip around her chest pressed her close to her attacker&#x2019;s torso, forcing the breath out of her body. She was paralyzed by the man&#x2019;s strength and by the acrid stench emanating from him. Only when she realized what he was doing did she manage to offer some resistance. The man was using his free hand to try to loop something around her neck but was having difficulty getting it over her head&#x2014;not because he was so much shorter than her, but because she was struggling, twisting from side to side as she tried to free herself from his grip. He growled and hissed something unintelligible but managed to hang on to her. After a brief battle he had the noose where he wanted it. Instinctively she reached up and slid one hand under the twine. The attack itself had been so sudden that she hadn&#x2019;t had time to scream. She tried to call for help, but the only sound that came out was a faint whimper; the noose had already been drawn too tight. She felt him loosen his hold on her body so he could put more force into the act of strangulation. Even if she could manage to keep her hand between her throat and the twine, she was getting hardly any air. The darkness flickered before her eyes, and she realized that she would soon lose consciousness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She managed to slip her other hand into her pocket and rummaged around feverishly. Paper tissues, a box of painkillers, her cigarette lighter . . . Wasn&#x2019;t it there? It must be there! She panicked even more, her movements growing clumsy. Was it in the wrong pocket? The pain in her throat was unbearable. She couldn&#x2019;t breathe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once she felt the car key against her fingertips. She managed to find the little cylinder attached to the key ring and grasped it with trembling fingers. Her thumb slipped on her first attempt, but she could feel the button. Summoning up the last reserves of her strength, she pressed it again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screech of the attack alarm sliced through the silent neighborhood. She felt her attacker stiffen, and for a few vital seconds he lost concentration. She lifted one foot and kicked backward as hard as she could. The heel of her leather boot caught him just below the knee. He doubled over and groaned, loosening his grip for a fraction of a second. At the same time, she heard Bosse Gunnarsson open his door and yell:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What the hell is going on out there? I&#x2019;m calling the cops!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the presence behind her was gone. She heard the crack of the gate as he f lung it open and disappeared in the direction of the parking lot.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hey, stop right there! What are you doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bosse&#x2019;s voice again. Thank God for Bosse. She sank to the ground, trying to call for help, but all that emerged was a pathetic croak.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had survived. She was alive!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Panic had locked her hand around the slim cylinder in a vise-like grip. She couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to let go of the object that had saved her life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screech of the alarm stopped abruptly as the darkness<br> closed around her.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Under normal circumstances Irene Huss was not a morning person, but there were days when she seriously considered trying to become one. Mornings like this, for example. The air was crystal clear, with a hint of crispness left over from the chill of the night. Above the horizon an amazing sunrise filled the sky with intense shades of gold. Could there be a more perfect start to the day?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drew her robe more tightly around her body as she paused on the top step and inhaled deeply. The moisture from last night&#x2019;s rain intensified the smells. The garden looked as if it had just woken up feeling refreshed. The luxuriant asters glowed deep red in the cast-iron urns on either side of the steps, a final defiant protest against the inexorable approach of the fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She padded down to the low gate in her slippers, leaned over and took the newspaper out of the mailbox on the fence. As she turned to go back indoors, she stopped dead. It took a few seconds before she realized that the small garden seat that normally stood between the two kitchen windows had been moved and was now in the middle of the f lower bed beneath one window. The newly planted rose bushes were badly damaged: several branches were broken. Annoyed, Irene picked up the seat and put it back against the wall. Strange&#x2014;it had been there yesterday evening, hadn&#x2019;t it?<br>&#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; Krister said when she asked him a little later.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was standing at the stove cooking eggs, with crisply fried bacon and halved tomatoes piled on a plate beside him. As far as Irene was concerned, preparing such a hearty breakfast was a total waste of time. Three cups of black coffee and a couple of cheese sandwiches had been her standard start to the day for decades, but now her husband had decided that this was unacceptable. Perhaps it was, but it suited her. When she wondered how fried eggs and bacon could be regarded as healthy in view of the bad cholesterol involved, he had waved away the argument: &#x201c;GI foods! A whole world of dieters can&#x2019;t be wrong!&#x201d; To tell the truth, Krister was the one who needed to lose weight, not Irene.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put a plate of GI breakfast in front of her. As usual she could only manage to push the food around. At times like these she was seriously tempted to turn vegan, like Jenny. Their daughter had stuck to her principles for almost ten years and was now in Amsterdam, training to be a chef specializing<br> in vegan dishes. Jenny was following in her father&#x2019;s footsteps, but perhaps not exactly the way Krister had expected. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But you have to admit it&#x2019;s weird, the seat being moved,&#x201d; Irene persisted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s probably just Viktor and his pals fooling around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why would Viktor . . . You could be right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy next door was ten years old, and he and his friends were always running around the neighborhood. As far as Irene could tell, they all seemed to get along with everyone, and she hadn&#x2019;t heard of them getting into any serious trouble. She found it difficult to imagine why they would have picked up a seat and thrown it into the rose bed; it seemed completely pointless. The kitchen window was so low that Viktor could easily look through it if he wanted to; he wouldn&#x2019;t even need to stand on tiptoe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head and poured her third cup of coffee.<br> The following morning Irene woke at seven, despite the fact that it was Saturday, and she didn&#x2019;t have to go to work. Krister had worked late at the restaurant the previous night, and the soft, regular breathing from the bed beside her suggested that he would remain deeply asleep for quite some time. She crept out of the warmth of the covers. When she had finished in the bathroom she put on her running gear, automatically reaching for her knee brace. Her knee was too painful if she didn&#x2019;t use it these days. I&#x2019;m starting to fall apart, she thought gloomily.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened the door and jogged down the steps, then stopped and stared straight ahead. Slowly she turned around.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glorious asters had been torn out of their urns and lay strewn all over the lawn.<br> &#x201c;Viktor would never do such a thing!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malin, who was Irene&#x2019;s neighbor and Viktor&#x2019;s mother, folded her arms and looked deeply insulted. Irene tried to adopt a conciliatory tone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;To be honest I don&#x2019;t think he would either, but . . .&#x201d; she began.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So why have you come here accusing him, then?&#x201d; Malin snapped.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was not good for neighborly relations, Irene realized. Nor did it constitute a successful interrogation, her professional side noted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not accusing him, I just wanted to eliminate the possibility and ask him if he knew anything,&#x201d; Irene tried to explain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fucking police abuse!&#x201d; Malin yelled as she slammed the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police abuse? Presumably she meant abuse of power. To a certain extent Irene could understand why Malin was upset, but if she was so sure of her son&#x2019;s innocence, why was she reacting so strongly?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if in response to Irene&#x2019;s train of thought, Viktor came ambling along the street. He opened the gate and grinned at her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hi!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hi, Viktor. Listen, I just came to ask your mom something, but she got real mad at me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktor&#x2019;s grin disappeared and he looked anxiously at her. Irene gave him an encouraging smile. &#x201c;The thing is, someone&#x2019;s being doing weird stuff in our garden. They&#x2019;ve moved a seat and pulled up some f lowers. I just wanted to ask if you know anything about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy shook his head; he looked genuinely surprised.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene looked him in the eye and smiled again. His expression was still a little uncertain, but he returned the smile. A guilty ten-year-old wouldn&#x2019;t look that way.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktor wasn&#x2019;t behind the vandalism.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So who was?</p><h2>Beauty Awakened (Angels of the Dark, 2)</h2><p><br><br>New York Times <em>bestselling author Gena Showalter returns with another captivating Angels of the Dark tale, as a tormented warrior is brought to his knees by the most delicate of humans....</em><br><br>His name is Koldo.

Visit her at GenaShowalter.com.<br><br>Koldo stalked down the ICU ward of the hospital. He and the warrior with him were hidden from human eyes and protected from human touch. The doctors, nurses, visitors and patients misted through them, completely unaware of the invisible world playing out alongside theirs. A spirit world that had given birth to this natural world, the human world.<br><br>A spirit world that was the true reality for all creation.<br><br>One day, these humans would discover just how exact that statement really was. Their bodies would die, their spirits would rise&#x2014;or descend&#x2014;and they would begin to understand the natural world was fleeting, the spiritual eternal.<br><br>Eternal. Just like Koldo's irritation seemed to be. He didn't want to be here among the humans, on yet another silly mission, and he really didn't like his companion, Axel. But his new leader, Zacharel, wanted him busy, distracted, for he suspected Koldo teetered on the verge of breaking a heavenly law.<br><br>Zacharel wasn't wrong.<br><br>After everything Koldo had endured in his father's camp...after escaping and spending centuries searching for his mother, Koldo had finally found her&#x2014;and locked her inside a cage in one of his many homes.<br><br>So, yes. Koldo teetered. But he wouldn't ever cause the woman irrevocable harm. He wouldn't even lower himself to break one of her nails. For now, he simply hoped to teach her the horror of being trapped by circumstance, as she had taught him. As she was still teaching him.<br><br>Later, he would... He wasn't sure. He no longer liked to consider the future.<br><br>Because of his abhorrence of Cornelia, Koldo had landed in the Army of Disgrace. It was a terrible name for such a choice defensive force, but it was one that fit nonetheless. The members were the worst of the worst, the baddest of the bad...male and female Sent Ones who were in danger of damnation.<br><br>For various reasons, all twenty soldiers had ignored prized heavenly laws. They were meant to love, but they hated. They were to help others, but they really only hurt. They were to build up, but they only ever tore down.<br><br>Three months ago, the members had been given one year to mend their wicked ways, or they would be stripped of their abilities and kicked into hell.<br><br>Koldo would do whatever was necessary to keep that from happening&#x2014;even deny himself true vengeance. He refused to lose the only home he'd ever known.<br><br>Axel grabbed him by the arm, stopping him. "Dude! Did you see the meat bags on that girl?"<br><br>And there was reason number one why Koldo had a problem working with Axel. "Could you be any more disgusting?" He jerked from the warrior's hold, contact with another not something he enjoyed.<br><br>"Yeah," Axel said with an irreverent grin. "I could. But someone, and I won't say your name, K, my man, needs to get his mind out of the gutter. I wasn't talking about her chesticles."<br><br>Koldo ran his tongue over his teeth. "What, then?"<br><br>"Hello. Her demons. Look."<br><br>His gaze slid to the room at his right. The door had been in the process of closing and now clicked shut, blocking the occupant from view. "Too late."<br><br>"It's only too late when you're dead. Come on. You gotta see this." Axel strode forward and ghosted through the entrance.<br><br>Koldo's hands curled into fists, and he battled the urge to punch a wall. They had a mission, and distractions only extended their time in a place crawling with demons laughing at the pain the humans suffered and whispering into the ears of anyone who would listen.<br><br><em>Can't survive,</em> they said. <em>There's no hope.</em> And these humans...so many were puppets, with clawed hands tugging at their strings. If they failed to fight back, they would become casualties in a war between good and evil, either in this life or after death. One way or another.<br><br>That's just the way things worked.<br><br>The Most High ruled the heavens. "He" was actually a sacred trinity consisting of the Merciful One, the Anointed One and the Mighty One, and He was the King of kings, His word law. He had appointed several underlings throughout the skies. Germanus&#x2014;or Deity, as some of Koldo's kind called him, referring to a title, nothing more&#x2014;was one of those underlings. A king answerable to the King.<br><br>Germanus led the Elite Seven&#x2014;Zacharel, Lysander, Andrian, Gabek, Shalilah, Luanne, Svana&#x2014;and each of those seven led an army of Sent Ones. Zacharel, for instance, led the Army of Disgrace.<br><br>Sent Ones looked just like angels, but they weren't actually angels. Not in the sense the world knew, at least. Yes, Sent Ones were winged. Yes, they waged war against evil and helped humans, but in actuality, they were the adopted children of the Most High, their lives tethered to His. He was the source of their power, the essence of their very existence.<br><br>Like humans, Sent Ones battled the desires of the flesh. They experienced lust, greed, envy, rage, pride, hate, despair. Angels, in actuality, were servants and messengers of the Most High. They experienced none of those things.<br><br><em>Mind on the mission.</em><br><br>Koldo straightened his spine. Zacharel had tasked him and Axel with killing a specific demon here at the hospital. The demon had made the mistake of tormenting a patient who knew about the spiritual world around him, a male who had called upon the aid of the Most High.<br><br>The Most High was love personified, willing to help anyone who asked. Sometimes angels were dispatched, sometimes Sent Ones. Sometimes both, depending on the situation and the skills needed. This time, Koldo and Axel had been chosen. They had been nearby, headed to a training session, when Zacharel's voice had whispered through their minds, imparting instructions.<br><br>Axel peeked his head through the center of the door and said, "Dude! You're missing it!"<br><br>"The person in that room is not our&#x2014;"<br><br>Grinning, the warrior once again disappeared.<br><br>"Assignment," Koldo finished to no one but himself. His anger intensified.<br><br><em>Control yourself.</em><br><br>He could move on and fight the demon he was supposed to fight, no problem, but according to Zacharel's orders, he wasn't to proceed without his partner.<br><br>Grinding his teeth, he marched forward. He slipped through the iron obstruction without any difficulty, stopped and glanced around. The room was small, with multiple machines attached to the motionless blonde female on the bed. A redheaded female sat next to her, chatting easily.<br><br>The redhead had no idea there were two demons standing behind her, pretending not to see the Sent Ones in the room.<br><br>"Two of the guys in my office got to arguing about who could run faster," she said, "and soon bets were flying."<br><br>Her voice had a whispery quality, as if filled with smoke and dreams, and it settled over Koldo like warm honey. And yet, with the soothing came a tensing. Every muscle in his body knotted up, as if preparing for war. He...wanted to fight such a delicate human? But why? Who was she?<br><br>"I felt as if I was standing in the middle of a stock exchange or something."<br><br>Laughter bubbled from her, such beautiful laughter, pure, with nothing held back. The kind he'd never experienced himself.<br><br>"They decided to race in the parking lot instead of have lunch, and the loser had to eat whatever's in the plastic bowl in the break room fridge. The one that's been in there for over a month and is now black. I heard the cheers as I was pulling out of the lot, but I didn't get to see who won."<br><br>Wistful now. Why?<br><br>"You would have voted for Blaine, I'm sure. He's only five-nine, so he wouldn't tower over you <em>too</em> badly, and he has the cutest blue eyes. Not that his looks have anything to do with his speed, but I know you, and I know you would have wanted him to win regardless. You've always been a sucker for baby blues."<br><br>He could only see the top half of her, but judging by the fragility of her bone structure, she was a tiny thing. Her features were plain, her skin as pale as porcelain, and her eyes as gray as a winter storm. Her mass of strawberry hair was pulled into a high ponytail, the ends curling all the way to her elbow.<br><br>There was an air of fatigue surrounding her, and yet, there was a sparkle in those winter eyes.<br><br>A sparkle the demons behind her would soon snuff out.<br><br>He forced his attention on the pair. One was posted at her left and one was posted at her right, and both had a proprietary hand on her shoulder. They were Koldo's size, with dark, pupilless eyes that reminded him of bottomless pits. Lefty had a single horn protruding from the center of his forehead, and crimson scales rather than flesh. Righty had two thick horns rising from his scalp, and dark, matted fur.<br><br>There were many different types of demons, and they came in all different shapes and sizes. From the first of their kind, the fallen archangel Lucifer, to the viha, the paura, the nasili, the slecht, the grzech, the pica and the envexa. And sadly, many more. Each sought the destruction of mankind&#x2014;one man at a time, if necessary.<br><br>Amid the types of demons, there were ranks. Righty was a top-of-the-line paura, and all about fear. Lefty was a top-of-the-line grzech, and all about sickness.<br><br>Demons liked to attach themselves to humans and, through whispers and deceit, infect them with a toxin that caused their anxiety levels to spike, in the case of the paura, and the immune system to weaken, in the case of the grzech. Then, the demons fed off the ensuing panic and upset, weakening the humans further and making them easy targets for destruction.<br><br>The girl must have been a veritable buffet.<br><br>Just how sick was she?<br><br>Lefty gave up trying to ignore Axel and glared at him as he danced around, slapping his face and saying, "I'm hittin' you, I'm hittin' you, what're you gonna do about it, huh, huh?" in the good-ole-country-boy accent he sometimes liked to use.<br><br>Koldo despised demons with every ounce of his being. No matter their type or rank, they were thieves, killers and slayers, just like his father's people. They left chaos and confusion in their wake. They ruined. And this pair wouldn't leave the girl unless forced&#x2014;but even then she could welcome others.<br><br>His chest burned as he switched his focus to the girl on the bed. But...his gaze lasered through the wrinkled cover, the thin hospital gown, and even skin and muscle. What he saw astonished him.<br><br>To him, the blonde was now as transparent as glass, granting him a glance at the demon that had wormed its way inside her body. A grzech, different from the one plaguing the redhead. This one had tentacles that stretched through the blonde's mind and into her heart, draining the life from her.<br><br>The Most High often blessed Sent Ones with specific supernatural abilities during difficult situations, things like this X-ray vision, as he'd heard others call it. Until now, Koldo had never experienced anything like it. Why here? Why now? Why this girl and not the other?<br><br>The questions were overshadowed a second later, when, in the blink of an eye, Koldo learned exactly how this had happened to her, the information seeming to download straight into his brain.<br><br>Born at twenty-six weeks, the blonde and her redheaded twin had struggled to survive the heart defects they'd been born with. Multiple surgeries were needed, and both almost died countless times&#x2014;each time nullifying any progress made. Throughout the years, their parents had become fond of saying, "You have to keep yourself calm or you'll have another heart attack."<br><br>Innocent words meant to aid the pair&#x2014;or so it seemed.<br><br>Words were one of the most powerful forces known&#x2014;or unknown&#x2014;to man. The Most High had created this world with His words. And humans, who had been fashioned in His image, could direct the entire course of their lives with their words, their mouths as the rudder on a ship, as the bridle on a horse. They produced with their words. They destroyed with their words.<br><br>Eventually the blonde had come to believe the slightest rise in her emotions would indeed cause another painful heart attack, and with her belief, fear had sparked to life.<br><br>Fear&#x2014;the beginning of doom, for heavenly law stated that what a person feared would come upon them. In the blonde's case, the fear had come upon her in the form of the grzech. She'd caught his notice, and she'd been such an easy target.<br><br>First, the demon breathed his toxin into her ear, whispering destructive suggestions.<br><br><em>Your heart could stop at any moment.</em><br><br><em>Oh, the pain...it's unbearable. You can't live through that again.</em><br><br><em>This time, the doctors may not be able to revive you.</em><br><br>Demons knew human eyes and ears were a doorway to the mind, and the mind was a doorway to the spirit. So, when the blonde had entertained the terrible suggestions, constantly rolling them through her mind, the fear had multiplied and become a poisoned truth, causing her defenses to crumble, allowing the demon to slink inside her, create a stronghold and destroy her from the inside out.<br><br>She had indeed had another heart attack, and the necessary organ had weakened beyond what human medicine could repair.<br><br>Did the Most High want Koldo to help her, even though she wasn't his current mission? Was that what this unveiling was about?<br><br>Sighing, the redhead leaned back in her chair, returning Koldo's attention to her. Once again, he saw flesh and blood rather than spirit. The Most High's gift hadn't extended to her.<br><br>He didn't have time to wonder why. A waft of cinnamon and vanilla hit him, quickly followed by the sickening scent of sulfur. A scent the girl would not be able to shed, as long as the demons stayed with her.<br><br>"It's about time for me to go," she said, rubbing at the back of her neck as if the muscles were knotted. "I'll let you know who won that race, La La."<br><br>Did she have any idea that evil weighed her down and stalked her every move?<br><br>Did she know she was full of demon toxin, just like her sister? That, if she didn't fight, she would end up in the same circumstance, the demons worming their way inside her body?<br><br>Koldo could kill Lefty and Righty, but again, other demons would sense what easy prey she was and attack her. As unknowledgeable as she clearly was, she would surrender again.<br><br>For any kind of long-term success, he would have to teach her to wage war against the toxin. But to do so, he would need her cooperation and time. Cooperation she may not give. Time she may not have. But...maybe <em>she</em> was the one the Most High wanted him to help.

Holm and Gary D. Schmidt.</b><br><br> Spoiler alert: This book is not about the Three Stooges. It's about Noah and Dash, two seventh graders who are best friends and comedy junkies. That is, they were best friends, until Dash's father died suddenly and Dash shut Noah out. Which Noah deserved, according to Noa, the girl who, annoyingly, shares both his name and his bar mitzvah day. <br><br> Now Noah's confusion, frustration, and determination to get through to Dash are threatening to destroy more than just their friendship. But what choice does he have? As Noah sees it, sometimes you need to risk losing everything, even your sense of humor, to prove that gone doesn't have to mean "gone for good."<br><br> Equal parts funny, honest, and deeply affecting, All Three Stooges is a book that will stay with readers long after the laughter subsides.<br><br> "Perl has created a moving coming-of-age journey steeped in Jewish traditions and comedic history, elegantly balancing humor with an honest look at the impact of suicide. Noah's genuine voice and tricky situation will have readers pulling for him."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "This novel is excellent on multiple fronts. A satisfying story that will appeal to all middle grade readers."--SLJ<br><br> "Watching Noah repeatedly sliding on a banana peel (even, once, literally) gives readers plenty of occasions to wince, to chortle, and ultimately, to applaud."--<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "A&nbsp;welcome portrayal of a very difficult situation&#x2019;s impact on someone not ready to deal with it&#x2014;and there are plenty of funny moments to make it all easier to take."--<i>Horn Book</i><br><i><br></i></p><p>Erica S.

We always have seltzer, for two reasons. First, it&#x2019;s a classic comedy prop. If you don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m talking about, google the movie Three Little Pigskins.&#x201d; In it, the Three Stooges are all dressed up like women. The best part is when Curly gets seltzer down the front of his dress and goes &#x201c;Woo-woo-woo!&#x201d; and then sprays himself in the face. Second, Dash&#x2019;s dad drinks it like water (which, technically, it is), so we make sure we&#x2019;re well stocked for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Popcorn?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Check!&#x201d; confirmed Dash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We always have popcorn. Because, duh, who watches movies without popcorn? So with popcorn and seltzer taken care of, we were almost all set. There was just one final requirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is the doctor in?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Double check!&#x201d; said Dash, brandishing not one but two giant bottles of Dr Pepper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only was Dash&#x2019;s dad, Gil, the coolest guy on the planet, he was a total pushover at the Safeway. Unlike Dash&#x2019;s dad, my moms do not cave to my grocery store demands. Occasionally, if they&#x2019;re feeling generous, they&#x2019;ll get flavored seltzer. But at Gil&#x2019;s house, the Dr Pepper flows freely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nnn-okay, drop the beat,&#x201d; I said nasally, doing my best impersonation of a dorky kid impersonating a rapper. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get this party started.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;One sec,&#x201d; said Dash. Then he yelled, &#x201c;Dad!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on, dudes! Be right there,&#x201d; Gil called from upstairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad, we&#x2019;re starting without you!&#x201d; Dash replied. We often had to resort to this kind of deception.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hold your horses!&#x201d; his dad called back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Gil, hurry! I can&#x2019;t hold him off much longer!&#x201d; For Gil&#x2019;s benefit, I stage-whispered, &#x201c;Dash, don&#x2019;t do it. Don&#x2019;t start without him.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Too late!&#x201d; Dash yelled back, cuing up the first video clip. Adam Sandler stared back at us with a triangle play button on his nose. Dash and I both started to fake-laugh maniacally as if we were about to pee our pants over what was on the screen. We paused, listening to see if his dad took the bait.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still no Gil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Close but no cigar,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;All right, proceed to phase two,&#x201d; said Dash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded. On a silent count of three, we both shouted, &#x201c;Guess he won&#x2019;t mind if we put on an album!&#x201d; That almost always worked. Even Dash wasn&#x2019;t allowed to touch Gil&#x2019;s vintage comedy record collection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Really, you don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll mind?&#x201d; I continued loudly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah, he loves it when we pull records off the shelf and put them back in the wrong places,&#x201d; replied Dash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Records? I thought these were Frisbees! Catch!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good one,&#x201d; said Dash, cracking up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But, Dash!&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;I was just eating peanut butter out of the jar with my hands. Shouldn&#x2019;t I wash them first?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fine. Just wipe them on a record. He&#x2019;ll love that!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dudes. You don&#x2019;t have to yell. I&#x2019;m right here.&#x201d; Gil stood at the bottom of the stairs, holding bananas and Jiffy Pop. He was wearing his weekend uniform: a Chase Corporate Challenge 5K T-shirt and gray sweatpants. He had perpetual dark circles under his eyes, and even though he didn&#x2019;t have a beard, you could always sort of see the stubble on the bottom of his face through his skin. He also had really hairy arms like a gorilla, so whenever he wore T-shirts, we made monkey noises to mess with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo!&#x201d; I said. Because monkey arms plus bananas. Dash quickly joined in, grabbing a banana from Gil and peeling it. He took a giant bite, then grinned big while scratching himself and jumping around like a monkey. Gil plunked down the popcorn, tossed me a banana, and brandished his like a sword, challenging me to a duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something I ought to tell you,&#x201d; he announced, dramatically pausing to switch his weapon to his other hand. I chimed in, quoting The Princess Bride, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not left-handed, either!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dash laughed, then pointed his half-eaten banana at the tinfoil dome of the Jiffy Pop. &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he complained. &#x201c;I thought you were going to let us fry the brain.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Forgive me, master,&#x201d; said Gil, shifting gears and lurching toward us. &#x201c;I thought you merely wanted to . . . eat brains.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Brains! Wah-ha-ha!&#x201d; I shouted, abandoning my banana sword and staggering toward him, arms out like a zombie. Dash tore into the puffed-up foil and we both grabbed big zombie handfuls. The popcorn was coated with lots of bright yellow fake butter and maybe even fake salt. It tasted like my guinea pig Spud&#x2019;s salt lick. It was awesome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dash&#x2019;s dad saw what was happening and kind of dove between the two of us. &#x201c;Dudes! No zombie popcorn hands on my keyboard! Or peanut butter,&#x201d; he added, giving me a wink. &#x201c;Back off. I&#x2019;ll drive. Okay, fasten your seat belts. Let&#x2019;s get our SND on.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was our cue, so Dash and I chimed in and together we all yelled: &#x201c;Live from the basement, it&#x2019;s Saturday night!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SND is this game we made up. It&#x2019;s like SNL--as in Saturday Night Live, but with a D for &#x201c;dudes,&#x201d; obviously--played as a team sport: me and Dash versus Gil. We take turns streaming video clips and riffing on them, awarding points based on who makes who laugh and who finds the best stuff the other team hasn&#x2019;t seen before. Dash and I are undefeated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gil hit play and Adam Sandler began strumming his guitar and singing the Chanukah song: &#x201c;Put on your yarmulke / Here comes Chanukah / So much fun-ukah / To celebrate Chanukah.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dash and I munched popcorn, spewing it a bit as we sang along. Before long, we got to our favorite verse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is,&#x2019; &#x201d; sang Dash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Well, he&#x2019;s not,&#x2019; &#x201d; I jumped in. &#x201c; &#x2018;But guess who is?&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;All three Stooges!&#x2019; &#x201d; all of us crooned together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure if it was the singing or the salty popcorn, but my mouth had gotten really dry. Which meant that while Dash&#x2019;s dad was cuing up the next clip, I had to chug lots of Dr Pepper fast. Which of course led to another SND tradition:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Errrrrrpp.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Iddle-biddle baby burp,&#x201d; mocked Dash. He struck a pose and let loose. &#x201c;ERRRPPPP!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That was sort of like a burp . . . only smaller,&#x201d; I countered before chugging more soda and decimating him. &#x201c;ERRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Noah Cohen!&#x201d; said Dash, doing his best impression of Mrs. Moseley, who was our fourth-grade teacher. &#x201c;Always say, &#x2018;Excuse me&#x2019; when you pass gas!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, excuuuuuuuuuse ERRRRPPPP-me!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dash is better than me at a lot of things. For example: soccer, kickball, all sports period, being liked by girls. But I am by far the better burper. I also know more comedy routines by heart, even though by all rights he should because his dad is kind of the comedy king. Don&#x2019;t tell my moms, who are mostly awesome, except in the junk food category, but there are times when I would love to trade places with Dash so Gil could be my dad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a second . . . hang on . . . BRAAAAAAAPPPP!&#x201d; I cut loose again, strategically aiming my blast at Dash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll spot you knuckleheads twenty-five extra points if you can go without belching for one minute,&#x201d; said Gil. &#x201c;Besides, I think it&#x2019;s still my turn.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, sorry,&#x201d; we said. Back to the serious business of SND. Gil cued up the lobster scene from Annie Hall. Which is my favorite Woody Allen movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time. Even Dash says there&#x2019;s something weird about that, since most Woody Allen movie fans are my moms&#x2019; age or older.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Awesome!&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dude, you are an old soul,&#x201d; said Gil appreciatively. In this scene, Woody Allen is trying to cook lobsters, but they escape behind the refrigerator. Annie Hall is laughing, but Woody is totally freaking out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Talk to them!&#x2019; &#x201d; I said, doing Woody&#x2019;s line in my best Woody voice. &#x201c; &#x2018;You speak shellfish!&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it&#x2019;ll run out the other side,&#x2019; &#x201d; added Dash&#x2019;s dad, beating me to Woody&#x2019;s next laugh line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the clip ended, we gave Gil fifty points and I knew what had to come next. That&#x2019;s the best part of SND--when you get in the zone and just start riffing on comedy bits, having one lead to another and another. Kind of like a bar mitzvah DJ on a really good night. &#x201c;Ooh! Ooh! I call Sleeper next!&#x201d; I suggested, ready to go on a Woody Allen roll.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, &#x2018;Chopper Four&#x2019;!&#x201d; said Dash. Dash gets tired of the classics faster than I do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Chopper Four&#x2019;?&#x201d; asked Gil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sklar Brothers,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;You know, they do that bit about how television news teams go nuts when they get a new traffic helicopter.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Chopper Four went down mysteriously in the Hudson River . . . and Chopper Four was first on the scene. Coincidence? Or Chopper Four?&#x2019; &#x201d; barked Dash, quoting the clip.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Chopper Four!&#x2019; &#x201d; I added, doing the same. &#x201c; &#x2018;The way we see it, we&#x2019;re twice as good as Chopper Two.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, dudes, I know,&#x201d; said Gil, wrapping one hairy arm around Dash&#x2019;s neck and giving him noogies. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve only made me watch it, like, chopper-four-dozen times. I&#x2019;m not giving you guys any points for it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Chopper Four!&#x2019; &#x201d; we both screamed, sounding just like the Sklar Brothers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; said Gil, hands up in defeat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Chopper Four!&#x2019; &#x201d; we yelled again triumphantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gil poured himself some seltzer. He chuckled a couple of times at &#x201c;Chopper 4,&#x201d; but then he slid his chair back and took his cup upstairs. We hit replay when it ended and watched &#x201c;Chopper 4&#x201d; twice in a row (&#x201c;Chopper 8&#x201d;!). When Gil didn&#x2019;t return, we test-drove a couple more videos to figure out what to wow him with next. Gil loved it when we showed him new stuff, just like we--okay, I--loved it when he showed us old clips we hadn&#x2019;t seen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad, you coming back?&#x201d; Dash called upstairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You dudes go ahead,&#x201d; said his dad. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking a break.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was still one unopened soda bottle, so I grabbed it and held it up in front of my face. &#x201c;It is verse zen ve feared,&#x201d; I had it say in my best mad scientist voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Doctor, is there nothing that can be done?&#x201d; said Dash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yah,&#x201d; said Dr Pepper. &#x201c;Zee patient appears to be suffering from . . . lame-o dad-o max-i-mo zyndrome.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dr Pepper, didn&#x2019;t they take away your medical license?&#x201d; Dash accused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No! I am ze greatest doctor in all of hee-story!&#x201d; For emphasis, I tossed the bottle up in the air and caught it. Then I launched it to Dash like a football.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Dash, &#x201c;so you flew here from Europe? How was your flight?&#x201d; He tossed it back to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not bad,&#x201d; I replied, backing up and shaking the bottle before tossing it back. &#x201c;Except for ze turbulence.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; said Dash. He caught it and shook it some more before sending it skyward. I missed and it hit the ground again, rolling under Gil&#x2019;s chair. I grabbed it and shook it some more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No! I can&#x2019;t take ze pressure!&#x201d; I said, taking our skit to its inevitable conclusion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared I might--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Incoming!&#x201d; yelled Dash, diving for cover under his dad&#x2019;s desk as I unscrewed the cap, drenching both of us. I fell down laughing, landing in a puddle of Pepper. Dash began to slurp the fringe at the edge of the rug for comic effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Maxx! Gross!&#x201d; I yelled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maxx is what me and Dash call each other. It&#x2019;s from one of our earliest forays into comedy: a sketch we called &#x201c;Mr. Maxx,&#x201d; based on the name of a clothing store near us. We performed it whenever we had an audience of, say, more than one person. Me and Dash were the stars, with my big sister, Enid, and Dash&#x2019;s little brother, Pete, in minor roles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sketch would start with me and Dash and Pete offstage (at my house, this meant in the kitchen). Enid would walk on, dressed as much like a grown-up as possible, and pretend to wait for a bus. Then I&#x2019;d walk by her wearing a hat. Enid&#x2019;s line was, &#x201c;I love your hat! Where did you get it?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d respond, &#x201c;Mr. Maxx!&#x201d; and walk off. Then Dash would walk on and she&#x2019;d compliment his shirt and ask where he got it. &#x201c;Mr. Maxx.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d then do it again and again, naming different articles of clothing, until audience members threatened to leave. &#x201c;Nice tie!&#x201d; &#x201c;Mr. Maxx!&#x201d; &#x201c;Nice pants!&#x201d; &#x201c;Mr. Maxx!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we&#x2019;d push Pete onstage. The joke depended on him wearing nothing but a diaper. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Enid would ask him, &#x201c;what happened to all your clothes?&#x201d; Pete was then supposed to deliver the punch line: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mr. Maxx.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hilarious, right? There was just one problem. Pete was a baby, so he never got it right. Instead, he&#x2019;d realize he was the center of attention and start giggling. Then he&#x2019;d pull off his diaper and run in circles, yelling, &#x201c;Naked man!&#x201d; Not the kind of sophisticated humor we were aiming for at the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the four years since the dawn of &#x201c;Mr. Maxx,&#x201d; Dash&#x2019;s and my comic sensibilities have definitely evolved. That said, we still appreciate the inherent genius in, say, turning a soda bottle into a mad scientist or a banana into a sword. Some might call it screwball or goofball, but I think that shows a lack of imagination. The way I see it, if Gil didn&#x2019;t outgrow that kind of stuff, why should we?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, I confess that I was a little nervous the morning after the Dr Pepper explosion in Gil&#x2019;s office. We hadn&#x2019;t seen him since he &#x201c;took a break&#x201d; the night before, and even though we did some mopping, the basement was, well, I think my moms would probably use the word &#x201c;disaster.&#x201d; Dash and I woke up late and shuffled upstairs, only to find Gil in the kitchen wearing his sweaty running clothes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, dudes! Who&#x2019;s ready for breakfast paninis � la G-Force?&#x201d; Grinning, Gil slid the sandwiches off his George Foreman grill and onto our plates. Dash&#x2019;s dad uses what he calls his G-Force for pretty much all of his cooking. I gotta say, it&#x2019;s pretty versatile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bacon and eggs on waffles?&#x201d; asked Dash, inspecting his.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, don&#x2019;t yuck my yum,&#x201d; said Gil, which I&#x2019;m pretty sure he picked up from my moms. &#x201c;Ketchup? Hot sauce? Maple syrup?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, sure, and sure!&#x201d; I said. Dash passed me a glass full of leftover semi-flat Dr Pepper to wash the food down. Gil raised his coffee cup and toasted us with it, then turned his attention to the Washington Post.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, it was a totally typical post-sleepover morning. If I close my eyes, I can feel how warm and sunny Gil&#x2019;s kitchen was. I can smell the waffles and bacon and coffee. And I can remember how happy I was that I had nowhere to be for hours and that after breakfast we could pick up right where we left off showing each other comedy clips.</p></p><h2>Supergirl Book Four</h2><p>Peter David's legendary run on the Girl of Steel continues here in SUPERGIRL BOOK FOUR!

This book is a record of their discussions over three weeks in the spring of 1956, recorded with a view to the production of a contemporary version of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>. A philosophical jam-session in which the two thinkers improvise freely, often wildly, on central themes of their work&#x2014;theory and practice, labor and leisure, domination and freedom&#x2014;in a political register found nowhere else in their writing. Amid a careening flux of arguments, aphorisms and asides, in which the trenchant alternates with the reckless, the playful with the ingenuous, positions are swapped and contradictions unheeded, without any compulsion for consistency.<br><br>A thrilling example of philosophy in action and a compelling map of a possible passage to a new world.</p><p><p><b>Theodor Adorno</b> was director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt from 1959 until his death in 1969.

These bedtime stories eventually became the collection <i>Clever Polly and the Stupid Wolf</i>, a wonderfully thrilling and reassuring series of adventures in which the clever, independent, and unstoppable Polly fools the persistent, hungry young wolf time and again. In a match much like Bugs Bunny and the Road Runner but more polite and quick-witted, Polly and the wolf develop ever-more complicated ways of turning the tables on each other as they grow older and, in Polly&#x2019;s case at least, wiser. Three more collections of stories followed the original <i>Clever Polly</i>, all hilariously inventive variations on a much loved theme, and all of the stories are collected here for the first time.</p><p><b>Catherine Storr</b> (1913&#x2013;2001) was born Catherine Cole and brought up in Kensington, London. A talented organist, she studied with Gustav Holst at St Paul&#x2019;s Girls&#x2019; School. She graduated from Newnham College, Cambridge, with a degree in English literature and went on to study medicine. She began practicing as a psychiatrist in 1944 and worked at Middlesex Hospital in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s before becoming an editor at Penguin in 1966. She published her first book, <i>Ingeborg and Ruthy</i>, in 1940, and married Anthony Storr, a fellow psychiatrist, in 1942. They had three daughters: Sophia, Emma, and Polly&#x2014;for whom she wrote <i>Polly and the Wolf</i> and its sequels. In addition to her stories about Polly and the Wolf, she went on to write some one hundred books for young readers and adults, including <i>Marianne Dreams</i>, <i>Marianne and Mark</i>, <i>Lucy</i>, and <i>Tales from a Psychiatrist&#x2019;s Couch</i>. About her work, she once remarked, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t write with a child readership in mind, I write for the childish side of myself.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> <b>Marjorie Ann Watts</b> is the daughter of <i>Punch</i> cartoonist Arthur Watts. After training as a painter and illustrator in the 1940s, she worked for a time as an art editor and typographer before embarking on a career writing and illustrating books for children. In addition to her stories for young people, she has also published a novel, a story collection, a memoir of her childhood in wartime London, and a children&#x2019;s guide to European painting."The stories...empower girls and underdogs, and extol brains over brawn." &#x2014;Martha V. Parravano<br><br>"I can&#x2019;t think of much children&#x2019;s literature that offers as much simultaneous pleasure to parent and child as the Polly and the wolf stories. Rereading them, I marveled, roared with laughter, was moved by the wolf&#x2019;s eternal hopefulness. The stories are also exceptionally well-written. What&#x2019;s more, they provide the comforting lesson that calm intelligence will triumph over silly rapaciousness every time. It&#x2019;s no exaggeration to say that Storr&#x2019;s wolf is one of my favorite characters in all of fiction."&nbsp;&#x2014;Elizabeth McCracken<br><br>"This agility in the storytelling keeps the book from being just frightening, just comic, or just a cautionary tale...60 years later it still reads like a feminist reworking of <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>. The book even includes a story called 'Little Polly Riding Hood,' in which it turns out that the wolf has read the tale and mistaken it for a how-to guide for catching juicy little girls to eat. This story also has a character I particularly approve of: a grandmother, portrayed as quick-witted and able to see off danger. There are no weak little girls here, and no dotty old ladies either." &#x2014;Emma Healey, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"It is an extremely good book, but one that was rather forgotten - in the last 10 or 15 years it had more or less disappeared from view. When we made it our book of the month and gave it a prominent place in all the shops, parents and grandparents remembered it and bought it." &#x2014;James Daunt, chief executive of Waterstones<br><br>"With its charming black and white illustrations of a little girl with pigtails and knee socks, it is a throwback to another age. Yet the story of a resourceful child who outwits a wolf has flown to the top of the children's best-seller list at Waterstones [UK], out-selling popular adult titles including Paula Hawkins' hit thriller <i>The Girl On The Train</i>." &#x2014;Anita Singh, <i>The Telegraph</i> (UK)</p><h2>Fire and Ink: An Anthology of Social Action Writing</h2><p><i>Fire and Ink </i>is a powerful and impassioned anthology of stories, poems, interviews, and essays that confront some of the most pressing social issues of our day. Designed to inspire and inform, this collection embodies the concepts of &#x201c;breaking silence,&#x201d; &#x201c;bearing witness,&#x201d; resistance, and resilience. Beyond students and teachers, the book will appeal to all readers with a commitment to social justice.<br><br><i>Fire and Ink</i> brings together, for the first time in one volume, politically engaged writing by poets, fiction writers, and essayists. Including many of our finest writers&#x2014;Mart�n Espada, Adrienne Rich, June Jordan, Patricia Smith, Gloria Anzald�a, Sharon Olds, Arundhati Roy, Sonia Sanchez, Carolyn Forche, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Alice Walker, Linda Hogan, Gary Soto, Kim Blaeser, Minnie Bruce Pratt, Li-Young Lee, and Jimmy Santiago Baca, among others&#x2014;this is an indispensable collection.<br><br> This groundbreaking anthology marks the emergence of social action writing as a distinct field within creative writing and literature. Featuring never-before-published pieces, as well as reprinted material, <i>Fire and Ink</i> is divided into ten sections focused on significant social issues, including identity, sexuality and gender, the environment, social justice, work, war, and peace. The pieces can often be gripping, such as &#x201c;Frame,&#x201d; in which Adrienne Rich confronts government and police brutality, or Chris Abani&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ode to Joy,&#x201d; which documents great courage in the face of mortal danger.<br><br><i>Fire and Ink </i>serves as a wonderful reader for a wide range of courses, from composition and rhetoric classes to courses in ethnic studies, gender studies, American studies, and even political science, by facing a past that was often accompanied by injustice and suffering. But beyond that, this collection teaches us that we all have the power to create a more equitable and just future.</p><p>Poet <b>Frances Payne Adler </b>is a professor and founder of the Creative Writing and Social Action Program at California State University, Monterey Bay. She is the author of five books, including <i>The Making of a Matriot,</i> and is nationally recognized for her collaborative social action art exhibitions. Fiction writer<b> Debra Busman</b>, a longtime activist and community organizer, and poet <b>Diana Garc�a</b>, a founding member of the Border Voices Project, are both professors and co-directors of the Creative Writing and Social Action Program, California State University, Monterey Bay.While the editors of this generous anthology of fiction and nonfiction describe social action rather dryly as a form of critical inquiry and an act of social responsibility, the passionate pieces making up the collection elevate it into a meditation on the sanctity and wonder of each life. It's that overarching sensitivity that gives these diverse creative voices their moral and political force&#x2014;and is echoed in the Buddhist mindfulness practiced by Vietnamese monk and social worker Ch�n Kh�ng, or the small things that make sense of the greatest transformations for novelist-activist Arundhati Roy, or the alertness to the trauma of being different in editor Garc�a's own migrant labor camp recollections. It comes as a refreshing antidote to the obfuscating abstractions clustered around the most pressing issues of the time&#x2014;including those that become thematic categories in the anthology, such as war, the environment and labor. The general quality of writing, among both better and lesser known writers of conscience, ensures the collection is as timeless as it is timely. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By illustrating the root causes of environmental disruption - global warming, soil depletion, desertification, water and air pollution - the authors show how to recognize and understand the complex contemporary problems involved in caring for the environment. The book offers both a coherent perspective for solving ecological problems of all kinds and a systematic approach that shows how organizations, institutions and individuals can push for environmental protection reforms. In three sections Schnaiberg and Gould ask the questions: Why should we be concerned? How does environmental disorganization get created? What has been done? And, finally, what can be done? &#34;Allan Schnaiberg has been to environmental sociology what Talcott Parsons was to mid-century sociological theory: a person whose work was an obligatory point of departure. A candid, penetrating and critical assessment of many of the sacred cows of environmentalism and antienvironmentalism. This book is a most welcome addition to the literature in environmental sociology.&#34; Contemporary Sociology</p><p></p><h2>Murder in Whistler (Northwest Cozy Mystery Series)</h2><p>You have secrets.

He stumbled back and sank onto the bench. His head fell against the wall behind him. &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be,&#x201d; he muttered. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it is.&#x201d; The reverend&#x2019;s voice trembled worse than the shanty walls, which shook in the evening wind.<br><br>Joel closed his eyes. His jaw clenched, and heat rose up his neck. Gideon O&#x2019;Riley was a dead man. If the task were up to him alone, he would see it done. Wanting to strike the boy, he curled his fingers against his leg, forming a fist so tight it threatened to turn his hand numb.<br><br>Opening his eyes, he tipped his chin and stared at the young woman who sat across from him. Cassie Allan, pretty girl. Her brown hair was stuffed into a tidy knot at the nape of her pale neck, hints of unruly curls tugging free. A glance into her eyes confirmed the trait ran deeper than appearances. Yes, unruly was the word. If only his daughter<br>were as cunning. He chewed the inside of his cheek until it burned. He glanced at the reverend. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s to be done?&#x201d;<br><br>The question hung heavily on the thick silence. On a bench near the fire, Bill O&#x2019;Riley lowered his head, hat dangling between limp hands. Defeated. He&#x2019;d yet to speak, and Joel doubted he would start now. Reverend Gardner shifted in his seat, bringing Joel&#x2019;s attention back to the old man who was too short for his weight. More like a mole than a man. Joel disregarded the thought and forced himself to focus on the matter at hand. The reverend had stuttered his way through the unwelcome news and now sat fumbling with his hat, making Joel wish he could snatch it away, ring the sweat out, and hand it back.<br><br>The bedroom door creaked open, and Maggie emerged from the darkened room. Huddled on the bed, his children, shadowed in the light of a single candle, made scarcely a sound. Never had there been so many people in his house. It was crushing. Maggie stepped from the bedroom and closed the door softly behind her. She offered him a weak<br>smile.<br><br>He ignored her.<br><br>&#x201c;I apologize for the church&#x2019;s oversight.&#x201d; The reverend&#x2019;s droning words were unsteady, and Joel&#x2019;s mind hunted for the vital points. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d like to put this embarrassment behind us...&#x201d;<br><br>Joel coughed. He tried to focus.<br><br>&#x201c;There is no other choice but to remedy this. Gideon and your daughter must return...if we&#x2019;re to repair the Allans&#x2019; honor.&#x201d;<br><br>Glass clanged against metal. The reverend stopped and nodded to his hostess. With her eyes down, Maggie ducked her head and lit the oil lamp, fingers quick. After silently sliding the glass over the flame, she slipped from the room. The door closed without a sound behind her. One less person. If only Cassie and her pa would leave. Take Bill O&#x2019;Riley<br>and their horrid news with them.<br><br>Joel felt the reverend&#x2019;s gaze on him.<br><br>&#x201c;We must find them.&#x201d; In the candlelight, shadows haunted his face. Leaning forward, Joel rubbed his hands together. Grit ground between his palms. The mistake was Gideon&#x2019;s&#x2014;his foolish son-in-law who had deceived them all. The reverend rambled on, and Joel warred with the urge to backhand him. The church&#x2019;s oversight. Hah! It bordered on criminal.<br><br>But Joel could not turn back time. Lonnie was already married to the scoundrel. And now they were asking him to get them home. Now. &#x201c;And my daughter&#x201d;&#x2014;Joel ran a hand along the scruff of his jaw&#x2014;&#x201c;what&#x2019;s to become of her?&#x201d;<br><br>An unwelcome voice invaded the conversation. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beside the point.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry Allan. Joel glared at Cassie&#x2019;s father. &#x201c;Watch yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gentlemen, please.&#x201d; Gardner&#x2019;s quivering hands reached for the space between the men.<br><br>Henry leaned back in his chair, his face filled with a brokenness that was beyond Joel.<br><br>Supper sat untouched on the table, and though the fire in the castiron stove had dwindled to meager coals, the smell of roast chicken still hung in the air. A cruel reminder of his empty stomach. If that weren&#x2019;t rude enough, now Cassie&#x2019;s father was giving him lip. At least Bill O&#x2019;Riley was silent where he sat. The man hadn&#x2019;t an argument to his name. Their children were heathens, the pair of them. The truth made Joel shift in his seat, disgust sliding through his veins.<br><br>Joel rubbed his knuckles together to loosen the tension that swept through the rigid muscles in his arm. &#x201c;Lonnie&#x2019;s my oldest girl, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what of my oldest girl? Abandoned.&#x201d; Henry&#x2019;s last word slipped out in a pained whisper, and he stood, sending his chair tilting. His hands, now balled into fists, shook with each word. &#x201c;Think of the pain my Cassie has endured these last months.&#x201d;<br><br>The young woman rolled her eyes, the wayward motion tipping Joel&#x2019;s head back. If she were his daughter, he&#x2019;d smack the look off her face. But Henry Allan was too busy gaining the reverend&#x2019;s sympathy to notice. Let him have it. Joel had no desire to fight for Lonnie&#x2019;s innocence.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t exist. They had all been fooled.<br><br>He should have expected it from Gideon. The wretch whom less than an hour ago he had still considered family. And look where it landed him. Joel glanced at the reverend, ignoring the man who hovered angrily beside them. He was finished with Henry Allan for the evening.<br><br>They should pass it off, wash their hands of this disgrace. &#x201c;Surely this situation is better suited for the law.&#x201d;<br><br>The reverend cleared his throat, and Joel realized he&#x2019;d spoken his thought aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;We would. But we wanted to bring it to you first.&#x201d; As if he&#x2019;d mustered some unseen strength, Reverend Gardner&#x2019;s beady eyes bored so deep into Joel&#x2019;s that Joel found himself shifting. Again. &#x201c;It seems that if all parties involved can come to an agreement of peace, we needn&#x2019;t bring in any outside aid...and the trouble it would bring. We need only<br>resolve the matter and see that the proper documents are in the hand of the circuit rider the next time he journeys on courthouse business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So, now I need to get them home. Is that it? Is there anything else I should know?&#x201d; Joel clipped the words off, not caring if his mood leaked through. &#x201c;What of the child?&#x201d; he nearly spat.<br><br>The reverend&#x2019;s eyes filled with sorrow as they met his. &#x201c;Will be your responsibility, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br><br>He should have known.<br><br>The reverend&#x2019;s face grew somber. &#x201c;It must be done. You must send word...bid them home immediately.&#x201d; He slid his hat on and rose slowly. &#x201c;Or the Allans will indeed involve the law. Something, I believe, neither of us wants.&#x201d; His fat throat worked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d imagine that having the law knocking on your doorstep, asking questions, isn&#x2019;t desired.&#x201d; Firelight<br>drew the shadows long across his face. &#x201c;The law has a way of...unearthing things.&#x201d;<br><br>Joel wanted to wring that fat neck.<br><br>Irritation shot through him that the reverend knew of the accusations. The rumors. Joel would deny the stories until his last breath. But still...a man of the law knew how to hunt for truths best left buried deep. He had no desire to test that.<br><br>He stepped toward the door, which was rattling on its hinges in the windstorm that beat against the house. With a single nod, Bill O&#x2019;Riley rose from his bench and quickly bid the room goodnight in a husky voice.<br><br>The reverend held the door open and, with a stiff nod, motioned for the Allans. Cassie stepped out first, clutching her shawl, which fluttered and slapped with a life of its own. Joel caught the glint of her eyes in the moonlight. Her pa followed close on her heels. The wind howled. Henry Allan glanced back over his shoulder, pinning Joel with a fierce<br>stare before pulling his hat over hair the color of dirty snow.<br><br>The reverend hesitated and turned toward Joel. A gust of wind burst into the house, clawing its chilly fingers through Joel&#x2019;s thin shirt. &#x201c;Mr. Sawyer. Again, please know that I am sorry. This, uh, sort of thing does not happen...often.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Wall: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>An <em>NPR</em> "Favorite Books of the Year" and <em>Financial Times</em> "Best Fiction of the Year" selection.<br><br> The best-selling author of <em>The Debt to Pleasure</em> and <em>Capital</em> returns with a chilling fable for our time.</strong></p><p>Ravaged by the Change, an island nation in a time very like our own has built the Wall&#x2015;an enormous concrete barrier around its entire coastline.

In <i>No Place for Russia</i>, William H. Hill traces the development of the post&#x2013;Cold War European security order to explain today&#x2019;s tensions, showing how attempts to integrate Russia into a unified Euro-Atlantic security order were gradually overshadowed by the domination of NATO and the EU&#x2015;at Russia&#x2019;s expense.<br><br>Hill argues that the redivision of Europe has been largely unintended and not the result of any single decision or action. Instead, the current situation is the cumulative result of many decisions&#x2015;reasonably made at the time&#x2015;that gradually produced the current security architecture and led to mutual mistrust. Hill analyzes the United States&#x2019; decision to remain in Europe after the Cold War, the emergence of Germany as a major power on the continent, and the transformation of Russia into a nation-state, placing major weight on NATO&#x2019;s evolution from an alliance dedicated primarily to static collective territorial defense into a security organization with global ambitions and capabilities. Closing with Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea and war in eastern Ukraine, <i>No Place for Russia</i> argues that the post&#x2013;Cold War security order in Europe has been irrevocably shattered, to be replaced by a new and as-yet-undefined order.</p><p>William H. Hill is professor emeritus of national security strategy at the National War College in Washington and a retired foreign service officer who served in various posts in Europe, the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Defense, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.William H. Hill's <i>No Place for Russia</i> is the most comprehensive and lucid account I have read of how the post-Cold War Euro-Atlantic security order developed. Hill&#x2019;s long experience as a diplomat and his scholarly eye offer new insight into the unsuccessful project to integrate Russia into European security structures, explaining how and why the buoyant optimism of the late 1980s gave way to the rancor and resentment that define attitudes between Moscow and the West today. An indispensable work for understanding why the East-West divide has reemerged, and a source of wisdom on how both sides might begin to repair the damage done. (John Beyrle, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and Bulgaria)<br><br>William H. Hill is the perfect person to tell the story of how the promise and hope that accompanied the end of the Cold War have been replaced by war and renewed division in Europe three decades later. As a longtime student of Russia and as a former diplomat directly involved in addressing some of Europe&#x2019;s most intractable security challenges, Hill brings a wealth of experience and insights into this clearly written, compelling, and timely narrative. (David Kramer, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor)<br><br>The end of the Cold War brought with it the expectation of a new era of peace and prosperity. What went wrong? A lack of trust and a lingering Cold War mentality in some quarters, compounded by misunderstandings, misperceptions, and missed opportunities, led to progressively worsening relations between Russia and the West. With his lucid and objective analysis, a direct witness and a protagonist of key events during the last quarter of a century helps us to understand. (Lamberto Zannier, high commissioner on national minorities, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)<br><br>William Hill provides a superb analysis of the evolution of European and transatlantic security institutions since the end of the Cold War, explaining why they collectively failed to provide the comprehensive security regime that many on both sides of the Atlantic hoped would emerge after 1989. Combining the analytical skills of a well-trained historian with the experience of a senior diplomat who participated in many of the events he analyzes, <i>No Place for Russia</i> provides a comprehensive analysis of why relations between Russia and West failed to develop around a regime of cooperative security and explores the challenges for policy makers throughout the region to cope with the ambiguous, messy international security disorder that has emerged in the early decades of the twenty-first century. (P. Terrence Hopmann, Johns Hopkins University)<br><br>A balanced history (<i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>At a time when Europe&#x2019;s security future looks increasingly tense, Hill&#x2019;s impressive analysis of the last quarter-century helps us understand how events turned from post-Cold War euphoria to early 21st century uncertainty. (<i>Russia Matters</i>)<br><br>William Hill has managed to assess a compelling yet complicated subject with a balanced approach.... a comprehensive and valuable source for understanding the roots and implications of the tensions between Russia and the West.

He lives with his wife, Anne, in South Carolina.A Note on Sherwood Anderson<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ONE DAY during the months while we walked and talked in New Orleans&#x2014;or Anderson talked and I listened&#x2014;I found him sitting on a bench in Jackson Square, laughing with himself. I got the impression that he had been there like that for some time, just sitting alone on the bench laughing with himself. This was not our usual meeting place. We had none. He lived above the Square, and without any especial prearrangement, after I had had something to eat at noon and knew that he had finished his lunch too, I would walk in that direction and if I did not meet him already strolling or sitting in the Square, I myself would simply sit down on the curb where I could see his doorway and wait until he came out of it in his bright, half-racetrack, half-Bohemian clothes.<br> &nbsp;<br> This time he was already sitting on the bench, laughing. He told me what it was at once: a dream: he had dreamed the night before that he was walking for miles along country roads, leading a horse which he was trying to swap for a night&#x2019;s sleep&#x2014;not for a simple bed for the night, but for the sleep itself; and with me to listen now, went on from there, elaborating it, building it into a work of art with the same tedious (it had the appearance of fumbling but actually it wasn&#x2019;t: it was seeking, hunting) almost excruciating patience and humility with which he did all his writing, me listening and believing no word of it: that is, that it had been any dream dreamed in sleep. Because I knew better. I knew that he had invented it, made it; he had made most of it or at least some of it while I was there watching and listening to him. He didn&#x2019;t know why he had been compelled, or anyway needed, to claim it had been a dream, why there had to be that connection with dream and sleep, but I did. It was because he had written his whole biography into an anecdote or perhaps a parable: the horse (it had been a racehorse at first, but now it was a working horse, plow carriage and saddle, sound and strong and valuable, but without recorded pedigree) representing the vast rich strong docile sweep of the Mississippi Valley, his own America, which he in his bright blue racetrack shirt and vermilion-mottled Bohemian Windsor tie, was offering with humor and patience and humility, but mostly with patience and humility, to swap for his own dream of purity and integrity and hard and unremitting work and accomplishment, of which Winesburg, Ohio and The Triumph of the Egg had been symptoms and symbols.<br> &nbsp;<br> He would never have said this, put it into words, himself. He may never have been able to see it even, and he certainly would have denied it, probably pretty violently, if I had tried to point it out to him. But this would not have been for the reason that it might not have been true, nor for the reason that, true or not, he would not have believed it. In fact, it would have made little difference whether it was true or not or whether he believed it or not. He would have repudiated it for the reason which was the great tragedy of his character. He expected people to make fun of, ridicule him. He expected people nowhere near his equal in stature or accomplishment or wit or anything else, to be capable of making him appear ridiculous.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was why he worked so laboriously and tediously and indefatigably at everything he wrote. It was as if he said to himself: &#x2018;This anyway will, shall, must be invulnerable.&#x2019; It was as though he wrote not even out of the consuming unsleeping appeaseless thirst for glory for which any normal artist would destroy his aged mother, but for what to him was more important and urgent: not even for mere truth, but for purity, the exactitude of purity. His was not the power and rush of Melville, who was his grandfather, nor the lusty humor for living of Twain, who was his father; he had nothing of the heavy-handed disregard for nuances of his older brother, Dreiser. His was that fumbling for exactitude, the exact word and phrase within the limited scope of a vocabulary controlled and even repressed by what was in him almost a fetish of simplicity, to milk them both dry, to seek always to penetrate to thought&#x2019;s uttermost end. He worked so hard at this that it finally became just style: an end instead of a means: so that he presently came to believe that, provided he kept the style pure and intact and unchanged and inviolate, what the style contained would have to be first rate: it couldn&#x2019;t help but be first rate, and therefore himself too.<br> &nbsp;<br> At this time in his life, he had to believe this. His mother had been a bound girl, his father a day laborer; this background had taught him that the amount of security and material success which he had attained was, must be, the answer and end to life. Yet he gave this up, repudiated and discarded it at a later age, when older in years than most men and women who make that decision, to dedicate himself to art, writing. Yet, when he made the decision, he found himself to be only a one- or two-book man. He had to believe that, if only he kept that style pure, then what the style contained would be pure too, the best. That was why he had to defend the style. That was the reason for his hurt and anger at Hemingway about Hemingway&#x2019;s The Torrents of Spring, and at me in a lesser degree since my fault was not full book-length but instead was merely a privately-printed and -subscribed volume which few people outside our small New Orleans group would ever see or hear about, because of the book of Spratling&#x2019;s caricatures which we titled Sherwood Anderson &amp; Other Famous Creoles and to which I wrote an introduction in Anderson&#x2019;s primer-like style. Neither of us&#x2014;Hemingway or I&#x2014;could have touched, ridiculed, his work itself. But we had made his style look ridiculous; and by that time, after Dark Laughter, when he had reached the point where he should have stopped writing, he had to defend that style at all costs because he too must have known by then in his heart that there was nothing else left.<br> &nbsp;<br> The exactitude of purity, or the purity of exactitude: whichever you like. He was a sentimentalist in his attitude toward people, and quite often incorrect about them. He believed in people, but it was as though only in theory. He expected the worst from them, even while each time he was prepared again to be disappointed or even hurt, as if it had never happened before, as though the only people he could really trust, let himself go with, were the ones of his own invention, the figments and symbols of his own fumbling dream. And he was sometimes a sentimentalist in his writing (so was Shakespeare sometimes) but he was never impure in it. He never scanted it, cheapened it, took the easy way; never failed to approach writing except with humility and an almost religious, almost abject faith and patience and willingness to surrender, relinquish himself to and into it. He hated glibness; if it were quick, he believed it was false too. He told me once: &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve got too much talent. You can do it too easy, in too many different ways. If you&#x2019;re not careful, you&#x2019;ll never write anything.&#x2019; During those afternoons when we would walk about the old quarter, I listening while he talked to me or to people&#x2014;anyone, anywhere&#x2014;whom we would meet on the streets or the docks, or the evenings while we sat somewhere over a bottle, he, with a little help from me, invented other fantastic characters like the sleepless man with the horse. One of them was supposed to be a descendant of Andrew Jackson, left in that Louisiana swamp after the Battle of Chalmette, no longer half-horse half-alligator but by now half-man half-sheep and presently half-shark, who&#x2014;it, the whole fable&#x2014;at last got so unwieldy and (so we thought) so funny, that we decided to get it onto paper by writing letters to one another such as two temporarily separated members of an exploring-zoological expedition might. I brought him my first reply to his first letter. He read it. He said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does it satisfy you?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> I said, &#x2018;Sir?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Are you satisfied with it?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Why not?&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll put whatever I left out into the next one.&#x2019; Then I realised that he was more than displeased: he was short, stern, almost angry. He said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Either throw it away, and we&#x2019;ll quit, or take it back and do it over.&#x2019; I took the letter. I worked three days over it before I carried it back to him. He read it again, quite slowly, as he always did, and said, &#x2018;Are you satisfied now?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No sir,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;But it&#x2019;s the best I know how to do.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;ll pass it,&#x2019; he said, putting the letter into his pocket, his voice once more warm, rich, burly with laughter, ready to believe, ready to be hurt again.<br> &nbsp;<br> I learned more than that from him, whether or not I always practised the rest of it anymore than I have that. I learned that, to be a writer, one has first got to be what he is, what he was born; that to be an American and a writer, one does not necessarily have to pay lip-service to any conventional American image such as his and Dreiser&#x2019;s own aching Indiana or Ohio or Iowa corn or Sandburg&#x2019;s stockyards or Mark Twain&#x2019;s frog. You had only to remember what you were. &#x2018;You have to have somewhere to start from: then you begin to learn,&#x2019; he told me. &#x2018;It dont matter where it was, just so you remember it and aint ashamed of it. Because one place to start from is just as important as any other. You&#x2019;re a country boy; all you know is that little patch up there in Mississippi where you started from. But that&#x2019;s all right too. It&#x2019;s America too; pull it out, as little and unknown as it is, and the whole thing will collapse, like when you prize a brick out of a wall.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Not a cemented, plastered wall,&#x2019; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, but America aint cemented and plastered yet. They&#x2019;re still building it. That&#x2019;s why a man with ink in his veins not only still can but sometimes has still got to keep on moving around in it, keeping moving around and listening and looking and learning. That&#x2019;s why ignorant unschooled fellows like you and me not only have a chance to write, they must write. All America asks is to look at it and listen to it and understand it if you can. Only the understanding aint important either: the important thing is to believe in it even if you dont understand it, and then try to tell it, put it down. It wont ever be quite right, but there is always next time; there&#x2019;s always more ink and paper, and something else to try to understand and tell. And that one probably wont be exactly right either, but there is a next time to that one, too. Because tomorrow America is going to be something different, something more and new to watch and listen to and try to understand; and, even if you cant understand, believe.<br> &nbsp;<br> To believe, to believe in the value of purity, and to believe more. To believe not in just the value, but the necessity for fidelity and integrity; lucky is that man whom the vocation of art elected and chose to be faithful to it, because the reward for art does not wait on the postman. He carried this to extremes. That of course is impossible on the face of it. I mean that, in the later years when he finally probably admitted to himself that only the style was left, he worked so hard and so laboriously and so self-sacrificingly at this, that at times he stood a little bigger, a little taller than it was. He was warm, generous, merry and fond of laughing, without pettiness and jealous only of the integrity which he believed to be absolutely necessary in anyone who approached his craft; he was ready to be generous to anyone, once he was convinced that that one approached his craft with his own humility and respect for it. During those New Orleans days and weeks, I gradually became aware that here was a man who would be in seclusion all forenoon&#x2014;working. Then in the afternoon he would appear and we would walk about the city, talking. Then in the evening we would meet again, with a bottle now, and now he would really talk; the world in minuscule would be there in whatever shadowy courtyard where glass and bottle clinked and the palms hissed like dry sand in whatever moving air. Then tomorrow forenoon and he would be secluded again&#x2014;working; whereupon I said to myself, &#x2018;If this is what it takes to be a novelist, then that&#x2019;s the life for me.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> So I began a novel, Soldiers&#x2019; Pay. I had known Mrs Anderson before I knew him. I had not seen them in some time when I met her on the street. She commented on my absence. I said I was writing a novel. She asked if I wanted Sherwood to see it. I answered, I dont remember exactly what, but to the effect that it would be all right with me if he wanted to. She told me to bring it to her when I finished it, which I did, in about two months. A few days later, she sent for me. She said, &#x2018;Sherwood says he&#x2019;ll make a swap with you. He says that if he doesn&#x2019;t have to read it, he&#x2019;ll tell Liveright (Horace Liveright: his own publisher then) to take it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Done,&#x2019; I said, and that was all. Liveright published the book and I saw Anderson only once more, because the unhappy caricature affair had happened in the meantime and he declined to see me, for several years, until one afternoon at a cocktail party in New York; and again there was that moment when he appeared taller, bigger than anything he ever wrote. Then I remembered Winesburg, Ohio and The Triumph of the Egg and some of the pieces in Horses and Men, and I knew that I had seen, was looking at, a giant in an earth populated to a great&#x2014;too great&#x2014;extent by pygmies, even if he did make but the two or perhaps three gestures commensurate with gianthood.<br> &nbsp;<br> [Atlantic, June 1953; the text printed here has been taken from Faulkner&#x2019;s typescript.]<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll from Southern California</h2><p><p>"It's fascinating to read this alternative history of pop music, as <i>Land of a Thousand Dances</i> offers a wealth of anecdotes, interviews, and facts that have never been so meticulously documented.

He is known for his distinctive saturated hues and idealized neo-classical imagery.The Arabian Nights <br><br> THE TALKING BIRD, THE SINGING TREE, AND THE GOLDEN WATER<p></p> <br>here was an emperor of Persia named Kosrouschah, who, when he first came to his crown, in order to obtain a knowledge of affairs, took great pleasure in night excursions, attended by a trusty minister. He often walked in disguise through the city, and met with many adventures, one of the most remarkable of which happened to him upon his first ramble, which was not long after his accession to the throne of his father.<br> <br>After the ceremonies of his father&#x2019;s funeral rites and his own inauguration were over, the new sultan, as well from inclination as from duty, went out one evening attended by his grand vizier, disguised like himself, to observe what was transacting in the city. As he was passing through a street in that part of the town inhabited only by the meaner sort, he heard some people talking very loud; and going close to the house whence the noise proceeded, and looking through a crack in the door, perceived a light, and three sisters sitting on a sofa, conversing together after supper. By what the eldest said he presently understood the subject of their conversation was wishes: &#x201c;For,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;since we are talking about wishes, mine shall be to have the sultan&#x2019;s baker for my husband, for then I shall eat my fill of that bread, which by way of excellence is called the sultan&#x2019;s; let us see if your tastes are as good as mine.&#x201d; &#x201c;For my part,&#x201d; replied the second sister, &#x201c;I wish I was wife to the sultan&#x2019;s chief cook, for then I should eat of the most excellent dishes; and as I am persuaded that the sultan&#x2019;s bread is common in the palace, I should not want any of that; therefore you see,&#x201d; addressing herself to her eldest sister, &#x201c;that I have a better taste than you.&#x201d; The youngest sister, who was very beautiful, and had more charms and wit than the two elder, spoke in her turn: &#x201c;For my part, sisters,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I shall not limit my desires to such trifles, but take a higher flight; and since we are upon wishing, I wish to be the emperor&#x2019;s queen-consort. I would make him father of a prince, whose hair should be gold on one side of his head, and silver on the other; when he cried, the tears from his eyes should be pearls; and when he smiled, his vermilion lips should look like a rosebud fresh-blown.&#x201d;<br> <br>The three sisters&#x2019; wishes, particularly that of the youngest, seemed so singular to the sultan, that he resolved to gratify them in their desires; but without communicating his design to his grand vizier, he charged him only to take notice of the house, and bring the three sisters before him the following day.<br> <br>The grand vizier, in executing the emperor&#x2019;s orders, would but just give the sisters time to dress themselves to appear before his majesty, without telling them the reason. He brought them to the palace, and presented them to the emperor, who said to them, &#x201c;Do you remember the wishes you expressed last night, when you were all in so pleasant a mood? Speak the truth; I must know what they were.&#x201d; At these unexpected words of the emperor, the three sisters were much confounded. They cast down their eyes and blushed, and the colour which rose in the cheeks of the youngest quite captivated the emperor&#x2019;s heart. Modesty, and fear lest they might have offended by their conversation, kept them silent. The emperor, perceiving their confusion, said to encourage them, &#x201c;Fear nothing, I did not send for you to distress you; and since I see that without my intending it, this is the effect of the question I asked, as I know the wish of each, I will relieve you from your fears. You,&#x201d; added he, &#x201c;who wished to be my wife, shall have your desire this day; and you,&#x201d; continued he, addressing himself to the two elder sisters, &#x201c;shall also be married to my chief baker and cook.&#x201d;<br> <br>As soon as the sultan had declared his pleasure, the youngest sister, setting her elders an example, threw herself at the emperor&#x2019;s feet to express her gratitude. &#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;my wish, since it is come to your majesty&#x2019;s knowledge, was expressed only in the way of conversation and amusement. I am unworthy of the honour you do me, and supplicate your pardon for my presumption.&#x201d; The other two sisters would have excused themselves also, but the emperor, interrupting them, said, &#x201c;No, no; it shall be as I have declared; the wishes of all shall be fulfilled.&#x201d; The nuptials were all celebrated that day, as the emperor had resolved, but in a different manner. The youngest sister&#x2019;s were solemnized with all the rejoicings usual at the marriages of the emperors of Persia; and those of the other two sisters according to the quality and distinction of their husbands; the one as the sultan&#x2019;s chief baker, and the other as head cook.<br> <br>The two elder felt strongly the disproportion of their marriages to that of their younger sister. This consideration made them far from being content, though they were arrived at the utmost height of their late wishes, and much beyond their hopes. They gave themselves up to an excess of jealousy, which not only disturbed their joy, but was the cause of great trouble and affliction to the queen-consort, their younger sister. They had not an opportunity to communicate their thoughts to each other on the preference the emperor had given her, but were altogether employed in preparing themselves for the celebration of their marriages. Some days afterward, when they had an opportunity of seeing each other at the public baths, the eldest said to the other: &#x201c;Well, what say you to our sister&#x2019;s great fortune? Is not she a fine person to be a queen!&#x201d; &#x201c;I must own,&#x201d; said the other sister, &#x201c;I cannot conceive what charms the emperor could discover to be so bewitched by her. Was it a reason sufficient for him not to cast his eyes on you, because she was somewhat younger? You were as worthy of his throne, and in justice he ought to have preferred you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sister,&#x201d; said the elder, &#x201c;I should not have regretted if his majesty had but pitched upon you; but that he should choose that little simpleton really grieves me. But I will revenge myself; and you, I think, are as much concerned as I; therefore, I propose that we should contrive measures and act in concert: communicate to me what you think the likeliest way to mortify her, while I, on my side, will inform you what my desire of revenge shall suggest to me.&#x201d; After this wicked agreement, the two sisters saw each other frequently, and consulted how they might disturb and interrupt the happiness of the queen. They proposed a great many ways, but in deliberating about the manner of executing them, found so many difficulties that they durst not attempt them. In the meantime, with a detestable dissimulation, they often went together to make her visits, and every time showed her all the marks of affection they could devise, to persuade her how overjoyed they were to have a sister raised to so high a fortune. The queen, on her part, constantly received them with all the demonstrations of esteem they could expect from so near a relative. Some time after her marriage, the expected birth of an heir gave great joy to the queen and emperor, which was communicated to all the court, and spread throughout the empire. Upon this news the two sisters came to pay their compliments, and proffered their services, desiring her, if not provided with nurses, to accept of them.<br> <br>The queen said to them most obligingly: &#x201c;Sisters, I should desire nothing more, if it were in my power to make the choice. I am, however, obliged to you for your goodwill, but must submit to what the emperor shall order on this occasion. Let your husbands employ their friends to make interest, and get some courtier to ask this favour of his majesty, and if he speaks to me about it, be assured that I shall not only express the pleasure he does me but thank him for making choice of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The two husbands applied themselves to some courtiers, their patrons, and begged of them to use their interest to procure their wives the honour they aspired to. Those patrons exerted themselves so much in their behalf that the emperor promised them to consider of the matter, and was as good as his word; for in conversation with the queen he told her that he thought her sisters were the most proper persons to be about her, but would not name them before he had asked her consent. The queen, sensible of the deference the emperor so obligingly paid her, said to him, &#x201c;Sir, I was prepared to do as your majesty might please to command. But since you have been so kind as to think of my sisters, I thank you for the regard you have shown them for my sake, and therefore I shall not dissemble that I had rather have them than strangers.&#x201d; The emperor therefore named the queen&#x2019;s two sisters to be her attendants; and from that time they went frequently to the palace, overjoyed at the opportunity they would have of executing the detestable wickedness they had meditated against the queen.<br> <br>Shortly afterward a young prince, as bright as the day, was born to the queen; but neither his innocence nor beauty could move the cruel hearts of the merciless sisters. They wrapped him up carelessly in his cloths and put him into a basket, which they abandoned to the stream of a small canal that ran under the queen&#x2019;s apartment, and declared that she had given birth to a puppy. This dreadful intelligence was announced to the emperor, who became so angry at the circumstance, that he was likely to have occasioned the queen&#x2019;s death, if his grand vizier had not represented to him that he could not, without injustice, make her answerable for the misfortune.<br> <br>In the meantime, the basket in which the little prince was exposed was carried by the stream beyond a wall which bounded the prospect of the queen&#x2019;s apartment, and from thence floated with the current down the gardens. By chance the intendant of the emperor&#x2019;s gardens, one of the principal officers of the kingdom, was walking in the garden by the side of this canal, and, perceiving a basket floating, called to a gardener who was not far off, to bring it to shore that he might see what it contained. The gardener, with a rake which he had in his hand, drew the basket to the side of the canal, took it up, and gave it to him. The intendant of the gardens was extremely surprised to see in the basket a child, which, though he knew it could be but just born, had very fine features. This officer had been married several years, but though he had always been desirous of having children, Heaven had never blessed him with any. This accident interrupted his walk: he made the gardener follow him with the child, and when he came to his own house, which was situated at the entrance to the gardens of the palace, went into his wife&#x2019;s apartment. &#x201c;Wife,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;as we have no children of our own, God has sent us one. I recommend him to you; provide him a nurse, and take as much care of him as if he were our own son; for, from this moment, I acknowledge him as such.&#x201d; The intendant&#x2019;s wife received the child with great joy, and took particular pleasure in the care of him. The intendant himself would not inquire too narrowly whence the infant came. He saw plainly it came not far off from the queen&#x2019;s apartment, but it was not his business to examine too closely into what had passed, nor to create disturbances in a place where peace was so necessary.<br> <br>The following year another prince was born, on whom the unnatural sisters had no more compassion than on his brother, but exposed him likewise in a basket and set him adrift in the canal, pretending, this time, that the sultana had given birth to a cat. It was happy also for this child that the intendant of the gardens was walking by the canal side, for he had it carried to his wife, and charged her to take as much care of it as of the former, which was as agreeable to her inclination as it was to his own.<br> <br>The emperor of Persia was more enraged this time against the queen than before, and she had felt the effects of his anger if the grand vizier&#x2019;s remonstrances had not prevailed. The third year the queen gave birth to a princess, which innocent babe underwent the same fate as her brothers, for the two sisters, being determined not to desist from their detestable schemes till they had seen the queen cast off and humbled, claimed that a log of wood had been born and exposed this infant also on the canal. But the princess, as well as her brothers, was preserved from death by the compassion and charity of the intendant of the gardens.<br> <br>Kosrouschah could no longer contain himself, when he was informed of the new misfortune. He pronounced sentence of death upon the wretched queen and ordered the grand vizier to see it executed.<br> <br>The grand vizier and the courtiers who were present cast themselves at the emperor&#x2019;s feet, to beg of him to revoke the sentence. &#x201c;Your majesty, I hope, will give me leave,&#x201d; said the grand vizier, &#x201c;to represent to you, that the laws which condemn persons to death were made to punish crimes; the three extraordinary misfortunes of the queen are not crimes, for in what can she be said to have contributed toward them? Your majesty may abstain from seeing her, but let her live. The affliction in which she will spend the rest of her life, after the loss of your favour, will be a punishment sufficiently distressing.&#x201d;<br> <br>The emperor of Persia considered with himself, and, reflecting that it was unjust to condemn the queen to death for what had happened, said: &#x201c;Let her live then; I will spare her life, but it shall be on this condition: that she shall desire to die more than once every day. Let a wooden shed be built for her at the gate of the principal mosque, with iron bars to the windows, and let her be put into it, in the coarsest habit; and every Muslim that shall go into the mosque to prayers shall heap scorn upon her. If any one fail, I will have him exposed to the same punishment; and that I may be punctually obeyed, I charge you, vizier, to appoint persons to see this done.&#x201d; The emperor pronounced his sentence in such a tone that the grand vizier durst not further remonstrate; and it was executed, to the great satisfaction of the two envious sisters. A shed was built, and the queen, truly worthy of compassion, was put into it and exposed ignominiously to the contempt of the people, which usage she bore with a patient resignation that excited the compassion of those who were discriminating and judged of things better than the vulgar.<br> <br>The two princes and the princess were, in the meantime, nursed and brought up by the intendant of the gardens and his wife with the tenderness of a father and mother; and as they advanced in age, they all showed marks of superior dignity, which discovered itself every day by a certain air which could only belong to exalted birth. All this increased the affections of the intendant and his wife, who called the eldest prince Bahman, and the second Perviz, both of them names of the most ancient emperors of Persia, and the princess, Periezade, which name also had been borne by several queens and princesses of the kingdom.<br> <br>As soon as the two princes were old enough, the intendant provided proper masters to teach them to read and write; and the princess, their sister, who was often with them, showing a great desire to learn, the intendant, pleased with her quickness, employed the same master to teach her also. Her vivacity and piercing wit made her, in a little time, as great a profic...</p><h2>Oceans Ventured: Winning the Cold War at Sea</h2><p><p><strong>A thrilling story of the Cold War, told by a former navy secretary on the basis of recently declassified documents.</strong></p><p>When Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981, the United States and NATO were losing the Cold War. The USSR had superiority in conventional weapons and manpower in Europe, and had embarked on a massive program to gain naval preeminence. But Reagan already had a plan to end the Cold War without armed conflict.</p><p>Reagan led a bipartisan Congress to restore American command of the seas by building the navy back to six hundred major ships and fifteen aircraft carriers. He adopted a bold new strategy to deploy the growing fleet to northern waters around the periphery of the Soviet Union and demonstrate that the NATO fleet could sink Soviet submarines, defeat Soviet bomber and missile forces, and strike aggressively deep into the Soviet homeland if the USSR attacked NATO in Central Europe. New technology in radars, sensors, and electronic warfare made ghosts of American submarines and surface fleets. The United States proved that it could effectively operate carriers and aircraft in the ice and storms of Arctic waters, which no other navy had attempted. The Soviets, suffocated by this naval strategy, were forced to bankrupt their economy trying to keep pace. Shortly thereafter the Berlin Wall fell, and the USSR disbanded.</p><p>In <em>Oceans Ventured</em>, John Lehman reveals for the first time the untold story of the naval operations that played a major role in winning the Cold War.</p></p><p>John Lehman, a former U.S. Navy aviator, served as United States secretary of the navy from 1981 to 1987.

He lives in New York and Pennsylvania.&#x201c;John Lehman has given us another naval classic in <em>Oceans Ventured</em>&#x2015;the incredible story of the Navy&#x2019;s central role in winning the Cold War. Based upon meticulous research and newly declassified documents, Lehman&#x2019;s fresh account has the grip of a well-crafted adventure novel. His perspective is uniquely authoritative: he was a key architect of American strategy, a crucial figure in its execution, and an active participant as a qualified naval aviator.

It is lean yet detailed, dramatic yet without hyperbole, and the lesson it teaches is something the public and the entire Washington policy community should internalize: that the projection of military power, done responsibly, leads to the projection of a nation's values. And when it comes to military power, the greatest weapon the United States had during the Cold War and today is its Navy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert D.

Outside observers often make two serious mistakes when they interpret the propaganda of this time. First, they assume the propaganda worked largely because they were supported by a police state, that people cheered Hitler and Honecker because they feared the consequences of not doing so. Second, they assume that propaganda really succeeded in persuading most of the citizenry that the Nuremberg rallies were a reflection of how most Germans thought, or that most East Germans were convinced Marxist-Leninists. Subsequently, World War II Allies feared that rooting out Nazism would be a very difficult task. No leading scholar or politician in the West expected East Germany to collapse nearly as rapidly as it did. Effective propaganda depends on a full range of persuasive methods, from the gentlest suggestion to overt violence, which the dictatorships of the twentieth century understood well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many ways, modern totalitarian movements present worldviews that are religious in nature. Nazism and Marxism-Leninism presented themselves as explanations for all of life&#x2014;culture, morality, science, history, and recreation. They provided people with reasons for accepting the status quo. <i>Bending Spines</i> examines the full range of persuasive techniques used by Nazi Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and concludes that both systems failed in part because they expected more of their propaganda than it was able to deliver.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Randall L.

As the pages of The Nine Freedoms are turned, the reader becomes aware that he is being taken on the longest, most dramatic, most important journey of all - the voyage across the nine seas of his evolution. Here, for the first time in history, the passage through the classroom of this Earth to glorious worlds of lasting achievement beyond - is laid out in intimate detail. </p><p> The same profound effect which was experienced by those serious metaphysical studentsalready exposed to a series of lectures on The Nine Freedoms, will be enjoyed by every reader, especially as no one will read this book by chance.

Through these celebrations of birth, partings, and reunions, this gifted writer displays both her love of the Navajo world and her resonant use of language. Blending memoir and fiction in the storytelling style common to many Indian traditions, Tapahonso's writing shows that life and death are intertwined, and that the Navajo people live with the knowledge that identity is formed by knowing about the people to whom one belongs. The use of both English and Navajo in her work creates an interplay that may also give readers a new way of understanding their connectedness to their own inner lives and to other people.<br><br> Luci Tapahonso shows how the details of everyday life&#x2014;whether the tragedy of losing a loved one or the joy of raising children, or simply drinking coffee with her uncle&#x2014;bear evidence of cultural endurance and continuity. Through her work, readers may come to better appreciate the different perceptions that come from women's lives.</p><p>"These stories, simple on the surface, are enormous and resonant. . . .

Both capture the voice of a storyteller steeped in traditional ways but fluent as well in contemporary expression....Tapahonso provides us with a true bridge to her culture and its spiritual insights."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>Navajo poet and English professor Tapahonso here celebrates the importance of conversation and the spoken word among her people. Driving back and forth between her parents' home in Shiprock, New Mexico, and her current home in Lawrence, Kansas, this gifted writer recalls snatches of family memories and tribal stories through the intermingled forms of poetry, songs, prayers, and anecdotes. Ranging across Navajo history, this collection in English and Navajo is warm and witty. Tapahonso states that for people like herself who live away from their homelands, "writing is the means for... restoring our spirits to the state of hozho , or beauty, which is the basis of Navajo philosophy." This book is a clear reflection of that sentiment. Recommended for most collections.<br><i>- Lisa A.

Bailey builds his world with great care, slowly and carefully drawing both you and the characters in, revealing some pieces of the puzzle only gradually.

The mystery is compelling but the heart of Dale Bailey&#x2019;s latest novel is the damaged relationship between grieving parents. Conquering their guilt and salvaging their love for one another depends on their ability to untangle the mystery. This is a heady combination of natural and supernatural influences, clues scattered by an enigmatic ancestor, and local legends both feeding and deriving from a work of fiction. Together these elements create resonance and urgency in a story about the complex workings of the human heart." &#x2014;<b>S. P.

Some days pass us by without leaving a trace and some days we remember forever. </p><p>Do you remember your first kiss? Or how the first rays of the spring sun feel? Or how about the best meal you ever had?These memorable experiences are characterized by intensity of perception, depth of feeling or sense of profound significance causing them to stand out in our mind and involve a heightened sense of wonder and awe.</p><p>But what ingredients produce these happy memories? Why is it that a piece of music, a smell, a taste can take us back to something we had forgotten? And can we learn to create happy memories and be better at holding on to them?</p><p>Combining research on happiness and mnemonics (learning techniques that aids memory retention or retrieval) Meik Wiking explores how peak experiences are made, stored and remembered.

Moments that will shape who we are.</p></p><p></p><h2>Seahenge: a quest for life and death in Bronze Age Britain</h2><p><p>A lively and authoritative investigation into the lives of our ancestors, based on the revolution in the field of Bronze Age archaeology which has been taking place in Norfolk and the Fenlands over the last twenty years, and in which the author has played a central role.</p><p>One of the most haunting and enigmatic archaeological discoveries of recent times was the uncovering in 1998 at low tide of the so-called Seahenge off the north coast of Norfolk. This circle of wooden planks set vertically in the sand, with a large inverted tree-trunk in the middle, likened to a ghostly &#x2018;hand reaching up from the underworld&#x2019;, has now been dated back to around 2020 BC. The timbers are currently (and controversially) in the author&#x2019;s safekeeping at Flag Fen.</p><p>Francis Pryor and his wife (an expert in ancient wood-working and analysis) have been at the centre of Bronze Age fieldwork for nearly 30 years, piecing together the way of life of Bronze Age people, their settlement of the landscape, their religion and rituals.

He has been a central figure in the so-called &#x2018;Wetland Revolution&#x2019; of British archaeology, and has published a number of specialist monographs on his discoveries.

Archaic beliefs in magic and ecstasy meet current notions of the power of the spoken word. Waldman writes, "The poem is a textured energy field or modal structure. The poems for performance seem to manifest as psychological states of mind. They come together in a mental, verbal, physical, and emotional form, making their particular demands on my voice and body. I am the &#x2018;energumen.&#x2019; The poem is the experience." Also included in this book are three essays on the oral tradition in poetry. One essay discusses the history and occasion of the title poem. The others treat such topics as performance art and poetic tradition, ethnopoetics, intoxication and transformation, Tibetan Buddhism, and the renewed ascendency of feminine energy in writing. Anne Waldman, world renowned for her high-energy poetry performances, is the author of over thirty books and chapbooks of poetry. She is the co-founder and director of The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado.</p><p>"Anne Waldman is one of the fastest, wisest women to run with the wolves in some time."&#x2014;<em>The New York Times Book Review</em></p><p>Anne Waldman, world renowned for her high-energy poetry performances, is&nbsp;the co-founder and director of The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado.&nbsp;She is the author of over thirty books and chapbooks of poetry including&nbsp;<em>The Iovis Trilogy: Colors in the Mechanism of Concealment, Voice's Daughter of a Heart Yet to be Born&nbsp;</em>and <em>Manatee/Humanity (Penguin Poets).</em></p></p><p>This expanded edition of Anne Waldman&#39;s poems and essays adds 20 poems and three essays to the original.

Haunted by war wounds and the woman who left him, Ex-Delta Army Sergeant Joe Warren is a man scarred body and soul. His life as he knew it is over, and he has no idea where to go from here. When his sister begs him to rescue a young woman in trouble, Joe reluctantly agrees to help&#x2014;and comes face-to-face with the most beautiful&#x2014;willful, stubborn, and sexy&#x2014;woman he&#x2019;s ever met. Lady Lydia Benedict yearns for a life of passion and adventure, one where she&#x2019;s appreciated for her brains as well as her beauty. But she panics when she awakens&#x2014;still dressed in her ball gown&#x2014;and discovers that the priceless pearl necklace she&#x2019;d worn to a charity ball the night before is missing. To make matters worse, Lydia never got permission from her mother to borrow the necklace, and it&#x2019;s her brother, who trusted her with the irreplaceable pearl, who&#x2019;ll be punished if it isn&#x2019;t found. Joe is Lydia&#x2019;s only hope, but the hard-hearted soldier and the British aristocrat find themselves at odds as time runs out. Can Joe allow himself to trust another woman? Can Lydia fall in love with a man who&#x2019;s nothing like the sophisticated gentlemen she&#x2019;s known all her life?

Can't wait for it to arrive. Terry has developed a mastery in storytelling. You are there. When he discusses being out in the middle of the night, I feel like reading under the blanket with a flashlight. Truly. The easy read is perfection as well as understandable, but have to force myself to put it down as I don't want it to end so quickly.

Temporarily silenced by the Inquisition's threat of torture, and forced to abjure his theories publicly, Galileo continues to work in private, eventually smuggling his work out of the country. As an examination of the problems that face not only the scientist but also the whole spirit of free inquiry when brought into conflict with the requirements of government or official ideology, <i>Life of Galileo</i> has few equals.</p><br><br><p> Mother Courage is usually seen as Brecht's greatest work. Remaining a powerful indictment of war and social injustice, it is an epic drama set in the seventeenth century during the Thirty Years' War. The plot follows the resilient Mother Courage who survives by running a commissary business that profits from all sides. As the war claims all of her children in turn, the play poignantly demonstrates that no one can profit from the war without being subject to its terrible cost also.</p><br><br><p>The translations are ideal for both study and performance. The volume is accompanied by a full introduction and notes by the series editor John Willett and includes Brecht's own notes and relevant texts as well as all the important textual variants.</p></p><p>Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) is acknowledged as one of the great dramatists whose work has had a considerable influence on the theatre. His landmark plays include<i> The Threepenny Opera</i>, <i>Life of Galileo</i>, and <i>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</i>. His plays and dramatic theory are central to the study of modern theatre.</p><h2>Beaded Chains &amp; Ropes: Create Easy-to-Wear Jewelry Using Popular Stitches</h2><p><i>Beaded Chains &amp; Ropes</i> presents many ideas for making over 25 sturdy, pretty chains and ropes.

Out of it came Samuel Taylor Coleridge's <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> and &#x201c;Kubla Khan,&#x201d; as well as his unmatched hymns to friendship and fatherhood, and William Wordsworth&#x2019;s revolutionary songs in <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> along with &#x201c;Tintern Abbey,&#x201d; Wordsworth's paean to the unity of soul and cosmos, love and understanding.</p><p>In <i>The Making of Poetry</i>, Adam Nicolson embeds himself in the reality of this unique moment, exploring the idea that these poems came from this particular place and time, and that only by experiencing the physical circumstances of the year, in all weathers and all seasons, at night and at dawn, in sunlit reverie and moonlit walks, can the genesis of the poetry start to be understood.</p><p>The poetry Wordsworth and Coleridge made was not from settled conclusions but from the adventure on which they embarked, thinking of poetry as a challenge to all received ideas, stripping away the dead matter, looking to shed consciousness and so change the world. What emerges is a portrait of these great figures seen not as literary monuments but as young men, troubled, ambitious, dreaming of a vision of wholeness, knowing they had greatness in them but still in urgent search of the paths toward it.</p><p>The artist Tom Hammick accompanied Nicolson for much of the year, making woodcuts from the fallen timber in the park at Alfoxden where the Wordsworths lived. Interspersed throughout the book, his images bridge the centuries, depicting lives at the source of our modern sensibility: a psychic landscape of doubt and possibility, full of beauty and thick with desire for a kind of connectedness that seems permanently at hand and yet always out of reach.</p></p><p><b>Adam Nicolson</b> is the author of many books on history, travel, and the environment. He is the winner of the Somerset Maugham Award and the British Topography Prize, and lives at Sissinghust Castle in Kent.<p><b>Named a Best Book of 2019 by <i>The Guardian </i>and <i>The Sunday Times</i></b></p><p>"[A] sublime, densely textured study . . . This is a book of wonders . . . Nicolson&#x2019;s prose swoops and sings all over the landscape; his poets&#x2019; embeddings in nature and interconnections of thought are richly evoked, and his enjoyment of their (and his) journey into understanding is utterly infectious. Wordsworth and Coleridge, were they able to read his fabulous tribute in some Parnassian glade, would surely tip their hats to a kindred spirit." &#x2015;John Walsh, <i><b>The Times </b></i>(London)</p><p>"[A] spellbinding recreation of the making of Romantic poetry amid the Somerset Quantock Hills . . . <i>T</i><i>he Making of Poetry</i> is an excitingly new kind of literary book, one which artfully combines illustrations (the bright and powerful woodcut images by Tom Hammick offer haunting correspondences to Nicolson&#x2019;s imaginative prose) with a naturalist&#x2019;s approach to biography. The result, hard-earned in arduous daily walks through difficult terrain, often in savage weather, enables the writer to evoke as never before the regular pilgrimages of Wordsworth, Coleridge and their companions . . . one of the most imaginative and luminously intelligent books about poetry I have read." &#x2015;Miranda Seymour,<b> <i>Financial Times</i></b></p><p>"Nicolson, in the footsteps of Wordsworth, comes with his own Coleridge, the prodigiously gifted and colourful artist Tom Hammick, whose dreamy woodcuts and paintings are scattered through the narrative . . . poetry and place are perfectly braided together in prose whose biographical mood pays tribute to Richard Holmes and whose topographical fervour evokes Robert Macfarlane." &#x2015;Robert McCrum, <i><b>The Guardian</b></i></p><p><i>"</i>[A] captivating book . . . intensely moving and thrilling. There are meditations on dusk, rain, wind, the exciting darkness and strangeness of &#x201c;winter power&#x201d;; there are wonderful words like 'rhyne', 'laminar' and 'haulms' and brilliant readings of the poems, the lives and the temperaments of the two poets, feeling the spiritual ley lines running between our time and theirs." &#x2015;Claire Harman, <i><b>Evening Standard</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;A fabulous book! Passionate, original, intensely personal, and thrillingly observant. Adam Nicolson has achieved a total immersion in the Romantic poets&#x2019; world, and I can&#x2019;t think of any other study quite like it. It will have terrific impact. The combination of Nicolson&#x2019;s fine nature writing through all the seasons, with his revealing use of local sources, and his own exquisite/patient close reading of the poets&#x2019; notebooks is completely captivating. It is also truly moving. Above all, he is fascinating on the central relationship between Coleridge and Wordsworth, the dark depths and emerging complications of that friendship: the rivalries and creative tensions it always contained, and the final sense of Wordsworth striding on alone into the Wye Valley.&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Holmes, author of <i><b>The Age of Wonder</b></i></p></p><h2>Of Murder and Men (A Cat Latimer Mystery)</h2><p><b>Love is in the air in Aspen Hills, and it&#x2019;s making a terrible mess of Cat Latimer&#x2019;s writers&#x2019; retreat&#x2014;especially when blood stains the plot . . .</b><br><br>Ever since her business partner, Shauna, fell for a wealthy landowner in town, Cat has been working double time to keep her writers&#x2019; retreat running.

Determined to make of her life a work of art, she tries to tell her story, sometimes casting it as a memoir, sometimes a novel, always fascinatingly incomplete.&nbsp;</strong></p> "Alameddine's new novel unfolds like a secret... creating a tale...humorous and heartbreaking and always real" (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>). "[W]ith each new approach, [Sarah] sheds another layer of her pretension, revealing another truth about her humanity" (<em>San Francisco Weekly</em>). Raised in a hybrid family shaped by divorce and remarriage, and by Beirut in wartime, Sarah finds a fragile peace in self-imposed exile in the United States. Her extraordinary dignity is supported by a best friend, a grown-up son, occasional sensual pleasures, and her determination to tell her own story. "Like her narrative, [Sarah's] life is broken and fragmented. [But] the bright, strange, often startling pieces...are moving and memorable" (<em>Boston Globe</em>). Reading group guide included.</p><p>Rabih Alameddine is the author of the novels Koolaids, I, the Divine, and The Hakawati, the story collection The Perv, and most recently, An Unnecessary Woman. He divides his time between San Francisco and Beirut.Talk about writer's block; Sarah Nour El-Din never manages to get past the first chapter of the memoir she aspires to pen. Alameddine's innovative novel collects several dozen of (fictional) Sarah's aborted attempts, a structural gimmick that works to create a revealing composite of a character who can't seem to finish her own story. Sarah is the Beirut-born daughter of a love match that went sour; her Lebanese father sent her American mother back to the United States when he tired of her and married a traditional Lebanese wife instead. Saniya, Sarah's stepmother, disapproves of her athletic gifts and packs her off to a strict convent school. Sarah, named after Sarah Bernhardt by her grandfather and just as mischievous and dramatic as the famous actress, grows up in wartorn 1970s Beirut, longing for American freedoms. She emigrates to New York with her first husband, Omar, and resists his attempts to force her to move back to Lebanon, losing custody of her son, Kamal, in the process. Over the next several decades, she marries and divorces again, suffers a devastating breakup with a controlling lover and becomes a well-known painter. Alameddine, a distinguished painter himself, is best known for Koolaids, a novel in which a Lebanese-American gay protagonist discovers he is HIV-positive. His Sarah is a compelling, believable character who struggles to establish an identity as she navigates between cultures, but one wishes that the novel's structure did not mirror her confusion so faithfully. Some vignettes are beautifully written and touching, but others seem rambling or irrelevant. Ultimately, the novel's clever framing device is also its weakness, as the reader yearns for the satisfaction of a linear story. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Walls of Constantinople AD 324&#x2013;1453 (Fortress)</h2><p>The walls of Constantinople are the greatest surviving example of European medieval military architecture in the world. They withstood numerous sieges until being finally overcome by the artillery of Mehmet the Conqueror in 1453, and exist today as a time capsule of Byzantine and Medieval history. This book examines the main defensive system protecting the landward side of the city, which consisted of three parallel walls about 5 miles long. The walls defended the city against intruders, including Attila the Hun, before finally being breached by European knights during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and, ultimately, destroyed by Turkish artillery in 1453.</p><p>Stephen Turnbull is recognised as one of the world&#39;s foremost military historians of the Medieval and Early Modern periods.

After studying English at Oxford, she worked as an English teacher in Greece, a literary agent in Canada, a freelance editor in France and editorial director of a publishing company on her return to England. Her travels in many countries inspired her to write a first book, Meeting Mr Kim, as well as stories in newspapers, magazines and websites. In 2011, she moved to the tiny Greek island of Tilos, where she now works from home surrounded by mountains and sea, and wrote the book Falling in Honey.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> <em>Pick an Island, Any Island</em></p> <p>I am looking for a Greek island.</p> <p>If I were going on my own, maybe I'd just take a backpack and trust to serendipity. I've fallen in love with so many islands over the years just by hopping on the next ferry: islands that smelled of herbs and pine trees, whose villages had whitewashed alleys overhung with magenta bougainvillea, stalked by cats and chickens. Islands where pigs roamed on the wild beaches and cows wandered through the ruins of ancient hilltop castles; where people gathered in the village square at least once a day to gossip and play backgammon; where the hills were filled with olive trees and thyme and dropped away to a deep sparkling blue.</p> <p>Once, island-hopping with another traveler, we'd arrived on the night of a big local festival. All the rooms were booked up, but sometimes you could sleep on someone's rooftop. It had been too late to ask permission, and I was slightly nervous the next morning when I heard a window opening by our heads, expecting a sharp telling off. Instead, we got an amused "Kalimera!" or good morning, and a coffee and biscuits.</p> <p>Later, we found a room to rent at the back of someone's house; our landlady, Eleni, gave us plates heaped with ripe fresh fruit from her garden every day. In the mornings I had a coffee and homemade biscuits on the balcony with her, and one day we went to help the family with the grape harvest. We followed stony tracks all over the island, accompanied by the sound of birds and crickets, but mostly to the empty beach where Eleni's mother used to go when she was courting. As the sun was going down, we sometimes stopped at a farm where a jolly man would fill up our water bottle with slightly fizzy homemade wine that we sipped on the way back to the pretty port, and we sat on the quayside watching brightly painted fishing boats bobbing in deep blue water, their nets laid out to dry.</p> <p>The spontaneous hospitality, the color, the traditional, rural island life, the shimmering blue sea, the sheer, sunny beauty of it all-that's what I'm looking for again.</p> <p>This time John and I are going together, so I've offered to book somewhere in advance. It feels like the grown-up thing to do, and a good compromise. I want him to get hooked on Greece too. I want to find somewhere new so that we can discover it together.</p> <p>Guidebook nearby, I look at some beautiful places to rent on various websites, but keep going back to a big villa with a swimming pool available for a reasonable last-minute deal on Tilos, halfway between Rhodes and Kos. It's an island I've somehow missed before, even though I've traveled up and down the Dodecanese. The villa looks fantastic. It's within walking distance of a village and two beaches.</p> <p>"Hey, Jen," mumbles John, who's been dozing in front of the Grand Prix in his sunny, cozy flat; he's been working some crazy shifts. Nestling into the couch for a while with him, I sift through the options, tell him about the villa and what little I've managed to find out about Tilos.</p> <p>"Book it! It's huge. We can bring Kate and Chris over. I owe her a birthday present-I'll pay for her flight."</p> <p>I smile. What a lovely, generous idea. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah, why not? I'll leave the decision to you-you're the expert on Greece, Jen! But it sounds great to me. Let's do it."</p> <p>I go back to book the villa with a big smile on my face, remembering how I met John and his sister Kate the first time.</p> <p>Almost a year ago, I was sitting at the bar of the Park Tavern one evening with a glass of wine and got into conversation with Kate, who was visiting from Vancouver. That's the kind of place the Park Tavern is. When I first moved to this town near the south coast of England for my work, the Park was a welcoming place to stop on my way home, look over some paperwork, and eat a sandwich. Soon, I got to know the landlord and he'd introduce me to people. I might end up talking to the local judge, a builder, a city planning officer, or a sausage maker. When John took on managing a local restaurant, he was welcomed into the special club of the Park Tavern too. He and his sister Kate were half English and half Canadian; I knew Vancouver, had stayed there with friends and visited the islands. We all swapped notes on favorite places. Kate wore vintage clothes, was a music producer, and had a mischievous grin. John looked very clean-cut with his suit and tie and baby-blond hair, but there was much more than met the eye; he had a wicked sense of humor, and the more I learned about him, the more I was fascinated. There was good chemistry between us. Before long, we started seeing each other.</p> <p>I don't mind that John's job involves working long and unusual hours. I happily spend the early parts of the evenings seeing friends or reading or catching up at the office; it's good having a bit of downtime for myself. I go for challenging bike rides or walks on the weekends while he works. I don't have to faff around in supermarkets making sure we have something for dinner; if we're hungry, he'll make us something later. When he finishes work, he comes to meet me wherever I am and we exchange news of our days on his sofa over a good bottle of wine or listen to music. We talk about our experiences and our dreams. I'm drawn to his passion for his work, the way he throws himself into what he loves doing, the way I do; I'm inspired by the way he nurtures his staff. And finally he's found a way to take a week away from work in the summer, a super-busy time of year for him, and spend it with me in the place I love, Greece.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My dad sometimes says his happiest memories are of family holidays we took when my brother and I were young. I'm pretty sure he's not thinking of the holidays when we drove to the south of France and he swore a lot trying to put up a seventies-style three-bedroom tent made of scaffolding and canvas during a torrential thunderstorm; or of the holiday where the old station wagon broke down carrying that tent through the Alps, and all my mum's clothes were stolen at a campsite in Italy while Hare Krishnas chanted next door. I expect he's mainly thinking about the later holidays when we ditched the tent and started going to Greece.</p> <p>I still have a diary from when we first went to Corfu-I was eleven:</p> <p>After a few seconds of waking up I literally jumped out of bed and dressed immediately.</p> <p>Apparently I enjoyed every minute of the three-hour flight (including the meal, described in great detail right down to the sachets). Then arrival in Corfu: the heat, the drive through quaint villages, the Greek folk songs, the vines and olive trees, washing hanging outside the whitewashed or stone houses.</p> <p>We step off the coach and the holiday really begins. We were on the beach after 15 minutes. The sea was blue and warm and the sand hot, white, and soft, even if it was a bit dirty with sticks and seaweed.</p> <p>I ate souvlaki and chips and Greek salad, and drank Greek lemonade, "which is more like fruit juice, and much nicer than English."</p> <p>If the first day is anything to go by, I think the holiday is going to be wonderful. Already by two o'clock we have sunbathed, swum, played in the dinghy... The sweets like Turkish delight are so cheap and sesame bars are only 8.50 dmx which is the same as 8� p. We did some Greek dancing at a hotel.</p> <p>I'm afraid we did bring back a record of Greek dance music. I remember all of us dancing around our house in Saddleworth to "Zorba."</p> <p>In case you're not familiar with it, you hold your left arm around the shoulders of the person to the left of you, and your right arm around the shoulders of the person to the right; you kick one leg out gently in front, then the other, then take steps to the side and repeat, slowly at first, but getting faster in time with the music until you think you can't keep going another minute and collapse, laughing, at the end (at least in our house we did).</p> <p>But I also remember the solo dances by the men: shows of grace, agility, and strength to slow songs about pain and heartache that were utterly mesmerizing.</p> <p>Miss Hatch, Hulme Grammar School for Girls' most eccentric teacher, with a passion for playing the violin and tending her tropical fish, scared most students off the classics during first-year Latin by making us all jump around the edges of the classroom carrying a ruler and shouting, "Um, am, em-object," a lesson most of us will never forget. But a few of us who were also perhaps eccentric went on to do Ancient Greek and memorized long monologues from classical plays, to be rewarded with powdery Greek coffee brewed in a metal jug and biscuits made from sesame seeds and honey. It's partly Miss Hatch's fault, too, that Greece got under my skin.</p> <p>By the time I was seventeen, I was the only student at my school still studying Ancient Greek, and Miss Hatch gave me extra lessons in my free periods if I wanted to finish reading and translating a text. She taught me how the ancient roots were reflected in Modern Greek, instilling in me a fascination with words. Over my teenage years, there were holidays to Rhodes and Crete, Cephalonia and Ithaca, and then with a university friend around the Greek mainland.</p> <p>After graduation from university, I'd had no idea what to do. I'd been applying for all sorts of graduate jobs, but with no clear goals (just big dreams), I wasn't getting very far at all. Then I saw an ad in the paper: an agency looking for graduates to be English teachers in private language schools in Athens. I thought of warm sunshine and blue sea, dancing and ancient amphitheaters. Maybe it was time to stay for longer. So I went to Greece.</p> <p>Athens, when I first arrived that autumn, was not much like those dreamy holidays I'd been on before. My new home as an English teacher-it came with the job that the agency assigned to me in a frontistirion, or language school, in the district of Galatsi-was beside a six-lane highway that never seemed to sleep, among an endless stretch of gray concrete apartment buildings. But in the afternoons, I went up to the roof of my building where people hung their laundry, and high above the noise of street level I marked papers or read books in the sun, looking beyond the jumble of faded apartments to the gleaming silver sea. On Saturday mornings I'd hurry to the port of Piraeus. The clocks on the back of each ferry showed what time they would leave for which islands, and that would determine my adventure for the weekend.</p> <p>On the island of Hydra, with houses clinging to rugged hillsides, there were no cars allowed and no real roads. I followed a footpath to the other, emptier side of the island, past a monastery and fields where mules and goats wandered, until the huge expanse of sea opened out before me. I found a flat rock on a hillside and lay barefoot on it, feeling like an Arcadian shepherdess as I ate my bread and cheese, basking in the warmth of the sun and the gentle breeze.</p> <p>In the winter, on a ferry to the island of Aegina, I ran into my friend Yiannis, who I'd first met in Hydra. He had just bought a new artist's studio outside the town, and invited me to come and stay. It was a converted stone barn, with thick walls and wooden beams. French doors opened out onto a patio where bougainvillea trailed from a wooden trellis, the fallen leaves and petals swept by the wind into a pretty drift against the wall. The bedroom window looked out across an orchard of frost-covered fig trees and vines. Yiannis looked perfectly at home, transformed in his potter's apron and woolen hat, his bushy black mustache peeping out over the top of a scarf. Unfortunately my attempts at getting a fire going while he got absorbed in his work were useless. So he taught me instead to help him shape the clay and we drank ouzo, the strong Greek aniseed liqueur, to keep warm.</p> <p>For the Easter holidays, I took the overnight ferry to the huge island of Crete. After another term's teaching in Athens in winter, I needed solitude and the rugged beauty of the wild, west coast. I found a room on a farm, whose big window looked out onto a deserted beach and a clear, pale blue sea. I scrambled high up rocks to vast views of wild scrub and mountains whose tops were enveloped in clouds. I tired myself out and then retreated under the quilts to fall asleep to the sound of birds and waves. Dinner was tomatoes stuffed with rice and herbs, or stews of potatoes, aubergines, broad beans, tomato, and more fresh herbs, with lots of fresh crusty bread. In the evening, I drank brandy and had live music played for me on the bouzouki, a Greek stringed instrument like a lute. The simple physical pleasures of sea and fresh air made me feel alive.</p> <p>The island of Mykonos in early summer was completely different, with its exquisite whitewashed dovecotes, the town a jumble of baffling alleys and painted balconies. Wending my way toward the harbor, I turned a corner and there was a huge bird strutting up toward me: Petros, the resident friendly pelican, with a soft pink quiff that he let me stroke. You couldn't help liking a town that had its own pelican. Later, I made friends with someone who made a living by performing Greek dancing and catching fish; he taught me a few steps of syrtaki and directed me to where I could watch locals dancing to traditional music, holding hands together in never-ending lines that snaked around the room, the steps far more complex than they looked to the observer. I danced and I swam at Paradise Beach and soaked up the infectiously free-love atmosphere of the bars and caf�s. A beautiful stranger said, "How do you say good-bye in England-kissing? On the lips? Like this?"</p> <p>Even Athens began to feel like home. I liked the orange trees lining the streets, even if they were straggly and dusty. It was a joy to listen to men standing in the bakery having detailed discussions about different types of bread, or to brave the busy queues in the local market to buy heavy bags of vegetables. Good things happened out of the blue. I would be reading a sign, and an old man would offer assistance; I would end up with incomprehensible instructions in Greek and a foolish smile on my face. I'd go up to the roof of my apartment building in the evening, see the mountains all smoky blue, Athens a hazy white jumble of crystals, and off Piraeus, tankers lying motionless in the sea. One evening, a man from Crete started talking to me as we were walking the same way; he liked Athens, he said, because he didn't need to buy cigarettes anymore-he could breathe bad air for free. "I like the pollution. I like the rubbish. I like fighting people for my position on the bus." I laughed. I knew what he meant. I liked the random, bizarre excitement of my new life too.</p> <p>It wasn't exactly clear what would happen next. Sometimes I thought I'd stay. Coming to Greece was not just about a job, I knew that. I was having the adventures that life should be about, searching out what my life was supposed to be.</p> <p>A few years later, I found myself living in Canada. I moved from one neighborhood of Toronto to another until I ended up on the Danforth-the Greek district. The street signs were in both English and Greek, there was a Greek butcher who sold marinated souvlaki, and travel agents catering mostly to...</p></p><h2>Greek Coins and Their Values: Volume 2 - Asia and Africa</h2><p>The second volume of this catalogue deals with the issues of mints in Asia Minor (including the islands and Cyprus), Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine (including Jewish coins of the Hasmonaean dynasty), Arabia, Mesopotamia, and other regions of the East, Egypt, Cyrenaica, and other regions of North Africa (including Carthage); also covered are the coinages of the Hellenistic Monarchies (Macedon, Thrace, Seleucids of Syria, Ptolemies of Egypt, Pergamum, Pontus, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Armenia, Parthia, Bactria and IndoGreeks).

What kind of sense is that?" </p> <p>Behind all the joyful personal stories of being close to death and going to heaven, there is a rarely discussed fact: that a significant minority of near-death experiences (NDEs) are unpleasant. They may be frightening, alienating, guilt-producing, and/or hellish, and they pack the same voltage of emotional and spiritual power as the beautiful ones. </p> <p>The images in those experiences are as old as myths and as recent as the nearest emergency room. Their interpretations shape religions and philosophies, New Testament doctrines and New Age ideas, video games and movies. For centuries, theyhave been understood as proof of the hell described by medieval Christianity.</p> <p>Is that hell the only explanation? Most of those interpretations assume the experiences exist as punishment. What if evidence shows that's not entirely true?</p> <p>Over more than forty years, Nancy Evans Bush has emerged as a leading voice in the search for answers to these questions. Her first book, <em>Dancing Past the Dark, </em> was a research-based description of distressing near-death experiences and their place in the cultural scene. Now <em>The Buddha in Hell and Other Alarms </em>draws on questions from her blog, conference audiences, and correspondence over the years to build a framework for a more personal discussion of perspectives not often seen in the literature. Her material is presented in three sections: </p> <ul> <li> Understanding near-death experience generally and distressing NDEs in particular</li> <li>The development of hell as a concept (eye-opening!), with varying perspectives</li> <li>Alternative ways of approaching hard questions, including religious ideas and profound psychological insights.</li> </ul> <p>Longtime readers know her writing as intelligent, engaging, and readable, respecting both religion and science in the age of the Hubble universe. One reader says, "In the wake of all the mainstream 'Heavenly tourism' pablum, this book should get plenty of attention. It will be one of only two books of its kind. Both written by the same author." Another writes, "Your first book was a life raft for my soul. Hoping I'll make it to safety with your next book."</p> <p>Here it is: <em>The Buddha in Hell and Other Alarms: Distressing Near-Death Experiences in Perspective.</em></p></p><p>Nancy Evans Bush, MA, President Emerita of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS), has for almost forty years been a voice for the substantial minority of near-death experiencers who encounter fear, guilt, and even terror rather than heavenly realms.

Segar's original <i>Popeye</i> (a.k.a. <i>Thimble Theatre</i>) comic strips features work from 1932 to 1934. In addition to the daily and Sunday strips, this volume will present a true collector's item: Segar's never-reprinted two-week "World's Fair" continuity. This sequence has never been republished since its original publication 75 years ago. This volume will also contain the conclusion of Donald Phelps's incisive and articulate critical essay on Segar's work "Real People, Real Theatre," and Richard Marschall's insightful analysis of Segar's continuity and story techniques. E.C. Segar blended complex narratives, slapstick traditions, brilliant characterization, and an inimitable cartooning style to create the most exciting and profound humor of his era. <br><br></p><p>E.C. Segar (1894-1938), creator of Popeye, is a member of the Will Eisner Awards Hall of Fame. He was born in Chester, IL in 1894 and passed away in his longtime home of Santa Monica, CA. The National Cartoonists Society created the Elzie Segar Award in his honor, which was awarded annually to a cartoonist who has made a unique and outstanding contribution to the profession.In the third oversize volume chronologically collecting the exploits of the indefatigable comic-strip sailor, black-and-white weekday installments offer lengthy, adventure-oriented continuities, such as the seafaring epic &#x201c;The Eighth Sea,&#x201d; featuring Popeye&#x2019;s first tussle with Bluto, and &#x201c;Star Reporter,&#x201d; in which he joins the Fourth Estate, acquires his &#x201c;infink&#x201d; Swee&#x2019;pea, and becomes a wandering amnesiac after a blow to the head gives him Bonkus of the Konkus. The less narrative-driven color Sundays, in which slapstick comes to the fore, are equally wonderful, especially those focused on the magnificent scoundrel J. Wellington Wimpy, one of the great creations of American humor, who &#x201c;looks like a down-at-the heels Buddha,&#x201d; Donald Phelps observes in the introduction, and elevates slothfulness to an art. Because he died in 1938 at only 43, Segar drew Popeye for less than a decade, but none of his successors approached his felicitous blending of vigorous cartooning and spellbinding narrative. Modern audiences who know Popeye and his supporting cast only through later animated cartoons will be surprised by the richness of his original incarnation. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>James Merrill: Life and Art</h2><p>Langdon Hammer has given us the first biography of the poet James Merrill (1926&#x2013;95), whose life is surely one of the most fascinating in American literature. Merrill was born to high privilege and high expectations as the son of Charles Merrill, the charismatic cofounder of the brokerage firm Merrill Lynch, and Hellen Ingram, a muse, ally, and antagonist throughout her son&#x2019;s life. Wounded by his parents&#x2019; bitter divorce, he was the child of a broken home, looking for repair in poetry and love. This is the story of a young man escaping, yet also reenacting, the energies and obsessions of those powerful parents. It is the story of a gay man inventing his identity against the grain of American society during the eras of the closet, gay liberation, and AIDS. Above all, it is the story of a brilliantly gifted, fiercely dedicated poet working every day to turn his life into art. <br>&nbsp;<br> After college at Amherst and a period of adventure in Europe, Merrill returned to the New York art world of the 1950s (he was friendly with W. H. Auden, Maya Deren, Truman Capote, Larry Rivers, Elizabeth Bishop, and other midcentury luminaries) and began publishing poems, plays, and novels. In 1953, he fell in love with an aspiring writer, David Jackson. They explored &#x201c;boys and bars&#x201d; as they made their life together in Connecticut and later in Greece and Key West. At the same time, improbably, they carried on a forty-year conversation with spirits of the Other World by means of a Ouija board. The board became a source of poetic inspiration for Merrill, culminating in his prizewinning, uncanny, one-of-a-kind work <i>The Changing Light at Sandover.</i> In his virtuosic poetry and in the candid letters and diaries that enrich every page of this deliciously readable life, Merrill created a prismatic art of multiple perspectives and comic self-knowledge, expressing hope for a world threatened by nuclear war and environmental catastrophe. Holding this life and art together in a complex, evolving whole, Hammer illuminates Merrill's &#x201c;chronicles of love &amp; loss&#x201d; and the poignant personal journey they record.</p><p>LANGDON HAMMER is professor of English and American Studies and chair of the English Department at Yale University.

He was no handyman, but the names of plumbers and carpenters show up in his address book. He knew the neighbors and shopkeepers; he drank at the bar of the Portuguese Holy Ghost Society on Main Street; and he came home with the town&#x2019;s gossip. &#x201c;David is my newspaper,&#x201d; Jimmy liked to say. Jimmy&#x2019;s role was in the kitchen. He was an assiduous chef, but an eccentric one, not a gourmet. He traded recipes with female friends like Toklas, who used his recipe for shrimp � l&#x2019;orange in The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook; in turn, she taught him how to bake hash brownies. He reprised leftovers with the stin�giness of a rich Yankee-improvised concoctions that sometimes seemed like pranks. In the kitchen, as at his desk, he was averse to throwing things away. More than once, when a casserole crashed on its way to the table, he picked out the shards of glass or crockery, and served it to his guests with a smile.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Hilda was their &#x201c;small, baritone-voiced, more than a little mad cleaning woman," as Jackson described her. She called Jackson &#x201c;Dave" and Jimmy &#x201c;Merrill.&#x201d; When neighbors said that they had peered into the apartment from a nearby building "and you was running aroun up here nakid," she defended the boys: &#x201c;I says, 'so what! its theah propity!&#x2019;&#x201d; Hilda told them about her mother in the state asylum and her father forced to work the &#x201c;night ship." An elderly and entirely &#x201c;stone-deaf&#x201d; Englishman fell in love with her (&#x201c;there&#x2019;s something in her nature, primitive don&#x2019;t you know, that appeals to me&#x201d;); and, when Hilda welcomed his advances, and word of it got around, her husband beat her up. She took refuge in the guest apartment at 107 Water Street. The police called on her, David called a lawyer, and Jimmy called the Englishman &#x201c;in pure self-defense,&#x201d; so as "to give her another ear (even deaf) to pour her sad tale into.&#x201d; None of this was lost on the neighbors. &#x201c;The beauty of life in a small town,&#x201d; Merrill reflected, &#x201c;is that everyone has a little part to play, and can be watched playing it by the others.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>That spring &#x2014; it was 1960 &#x2014; Merrill composed a poem about his Water Street home, called &#x201c;A Tenancy,&#x201d; which he dedicated to Jackson. The poem &#x201c;An Urban Convalescence,&#x201d; a lonely poem of self-questioning in which Merrill determines to create "some kind of house/ Out of the life lived, the love spent," would come first in Merrill&#x2019;s collection&nbsp;<i>Water Street&nbsp;</i>and &#x201c;A Tenancy&#x201d; last. In effect Mer�rill gives up New York in the book&#x2019;s first poem and makes his home in Stonington in the last poem. &#x201c;A Tenancy&#x201d; begins by looking back even further. The snowy, March afternoon light that he savors in his present home prompts Merrill to recall his elation when he took his first apartment in Amherst in 1946. It is dawn at the end of the war:<br><br>The dance<br> Had ended, it was light; the men look tired<br> And awkward in their uniforms.<br> I sat, head thrown back, and with the dried stains<br> Of light on my own cheeks, proposed<br> This bargain with &#x2014; say with the source of light:<br> That given a few years more<br> (Seven or ten or, what seemed vast, fifteen)<br> To spend in love, in a country not at war,<br> I would give in return<br> All I had. All? A little sun<br> Rose in my throat. The lease was drawn.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Almost fifteen years later, the duration of Merrill's first &#x201c;lease&#x201d; on life has turned out not to be &#x201c;vast&#x201d; at all. &#x201c;I did not even feel the time expire,&#x201d; he marvels. But that has changed:<br><br>I feel it though, today, in this new room,<br> Mine, with my things and thoughts, a view<br> Of housetops, treetops, the walls bare.<br> A changing light is deepening, is changing<br> To a gilt ballroom chair a chair<br> Bound to break under someone before long.<br> I let the light change also me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The &#x201c;changing light&#x201d;: this is the first appearance of that phrase which Mer�rill would return to for the title of his long poem,&nbsp;<i>The Changing Light at Sandover,</i>&nbsp;more than twenty years later. Here it is a trope for time and the way time changes the self, which Merrill is no longer determined to resist: &#x201c;I let the light change also me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A Tenancy&#x201d;: the title is curious, since Merrill is talking about a home he owns. It implies that we are merely tenants even in our own house. The principle holds for our bodies: &#x201c;The body that lived through that day,&#x201d; Merrill says about the long-ago day he is remembering, &#x201c;[. . .] is now not mine.&#x201d; His body, no longer the youthful one he had, will become stranger still with age. But, he reasons, perhaps the body is transformed by time before it is lost to it-like that ordinary chair which, although &#x201c;Bound to break under someone before long," becomes &#x201c;a gilt ballroom chair&#x201d; in the late-afternoon light. &#x201c;Would it be called a soul?&#x201d; Merrill asks, wondering what time is making of him. He doesn't go so far as to claim for himself a metaphysical, Keatsian &#x201c;soul,&#x201d; but simply a developed attitude, a point of view that is worldly, practical, and witty. He knows that &#x201c;when the light dies and the bell rings,&#x201d; guests will appear. He ends by welcoming them:<br><br>One foot asleep, I hop<br> To let my three friends in. They stamp<br> Themselves free of the spring's<br> Last snow &#x2014; or so we hope.<br> One has brought violets in a pot;<br> The second, wine; the best,<br> His open, empty hand. Now in the room<br> The sun is shining like a lamp.<br> I put the flowers where I need them most<br> And then, not asking why they come,<br> Invite the visitors to sit.<br> If I am host at last<br> It is of little more than my own past.<br> May others be at home in it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The metaphorical house envisioned at the end of &#x201c;An Urban Convalescence&#x201d; takes shape in Merrill's Stonington home. As in that poem, the switch from free verse into metered stanzas matters. At a moment when American poets were arguing over &#x201c;closed&#x201d; and &#x201c;open&#x201d; form, Merrill recognized that, to get beyond the self-enclosure of his early poems, he didn&#x2019;t have to reject rhyme and meter; he could change how he used them. In &#x201c;A Tenancy," he puts them in the service not of lyric idealization and abstraction, but of sociability and comic self-dramatization, and gives us a look into his house and his writing process. &#x201c;One foot asleep, I hop / To let my three friends in,&#x201d; he says, getting his metrical feet in working order, ready to host his guests and readers both. &#x201c;Closed&#x201d; form would be his means to openness.</p><h2>Exploits and Adventures of Brigadier Gerard (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><p>Having killed off Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle began a new series of tales on a very different theme. Brigadier Gerard is an officer in Napoleon's army&#x2014;ecklessly brave, engagingly openhearted, and unshakable, if not a little absurd, in his devotion to the enigmatic Emperor. The Brigadier's wonderful comic adventures, long established in the affections of Conan Doyle's admirers as second only to those of the incomparable Holmes, are sure to find new devotees among the ardent fans of such writers as Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser.</p></p><p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) graduated from Edinburgh University with a medical degree in 1881 and traveled as a ship&#x2019;s doctor before settling down into a private practice. He wrote Sherlock Holmes stories for four years before killing off the suave detective, only to resurrect him in&nbsp;<i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>&nbsp;in 1902. His historical fiction took the form of a novel,&nbsp;<i>The White Company</i>&nbsp;(1891), and the epic tales of the adventurous Brigadier Gerard.<br><br>George MacDonald Fraser, OBE (1925 &#x2013;2008) was an English-born author of Scottish descent, best known for his Flashman novels and McAuslan stories.

She became his full-time caregiver&#x2014;cooking, cleaning, and administering medications. When her father died, she was undone by the experience, by grief and the visceral quality of dying. Neumann struggled to put her life back in order and found herself haunted by a question: Was her father&#x2019;s death a good death?<br><br>The way we talk about dying and the way we actually die are two very different things, she discovered, and many of us are shielded from what death actually looks like. To gain a better understanding, Neumann became a hospice volunteer and set out to discover what a good death is today. She attended conferences, academic lectures, and grief sessions in church basements. She went to Montana to talk with the attorney who successfully argued for the legalization of aid in dying, and to Scranton, Pennsylvania, to listen to &#x201c;pro-life&#x201d; groups who believe the removal of feeding tubes from some patients is tantamount to murder. Above all, she listened to the stories of those who were close to death.<br><br>What Neumann found is that death in contemporary America is much more complicated than we think. Medical technologies and increased life expectancies have changed the very definition of medical death. And although death is our common fate, it is also a divisive issue that we all experience differently. What constitutes a good death is unique to each of us, depending on our age, race, economic status, culture, and beliefs. What&#x2019;s more, differing concepts of choice, autonomy, and consent make death a contested landscape, governed by social, medical, legal, and religious systems.<br><br>In these pages, Neumann brings us intimate portraits of the nurses, patients, bishops, bioethicists, and activists who are shaping the way we die. <i>The Good Death</i> presents a fearless examination of how we approach death, and how those of us close to dying loved ones live in death&#x2019;s wake.</p><p><b>Ann Neumann</b> is a visiting scholar at the Center for Religion and Media at New York University, where she is a contributing editor to the <i>Revealer</i>.

This is her first book.&#x201c;Neumann...takes an unflinching look at the reality of dying and end-of-life decisions...A valuable discussion of the complex issues involved in end-of-life care.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;Readers seeking a refreshing examination of an ever-changing singular human experience will appreciate this concise and accessible volume that combines curiosity, modernity, and compassion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Through elegant prose, Neumann&#x2019;s <i>The Good Death</i> thoughtfully tries to make sense of the process of dying and to learn what makes a good death.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jessica Bylander, <i>Health Affairs</i><br><br>&#x201c;Ann Neumann&#x2019;s father wanted to die quietly at home. Most Americans share this wish, but it frequently doesn&#x2019;t happen that way. We most often die not in the arms of those we love, but in rooms full of bewildering machinery and uniformed professionals. Caught up in the medical paradigm of cure, we assent to heroic measures we didn&#x2019;t want in hospitals we deplore. In <i>The Good Death</i>, Neumann sets out to understand this modern tragedy, volunteering as a hospice worker and developing deep attachments to the dying people with whom she works, hoping that frequent encounters with mortality will demystify it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrew Solomon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;At once detailed and accessible, <i>The Good Death</i> chronicles the history of the modern American death, including landmark cases the reader will recognize as having changed the course of media portrayal of living and dying in America. Neumann deftly navigates these situations and humanizes all sides of arguments for what makes a good death or life...A must-read for physicians and those passionate about care for the dying in this country, <i>The Good Death</i> provides additional context outside the specific realm of health care, or rather reminds us how we might impact the daily living and dying for all Americans, no matter socioeconomic circumstance or credo.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Pallimed<br><br>&#x201c;If <i>The Good Death</i> is anything, it is a call for people to examine their own wishes around end-of-life issues and decide what role religion&#x2014;either theirs or that of their caregivers&#x2014;will play.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kimberly Winston, Religion News Service<br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...If you have to take the big trip, having Neumann by your side wouldn&#x2019;t be a bad way to go.

Ann Neumann takes death head-on. With unflinching honesty and searing prose, <i>The Good Death</i> confronts the entwined realities of dying and surviving in all their complexity and pathos. It is that rare book that is at once a tremendously moving reflection and a clear-eyed approach to moments we all must face.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Peter Manseau, author of <i>One Nation Under Gods</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Good Death</i> is a work of fierce empathy, at times profoundly compassionate and at times driven by a sharp sense of the absurdities and injustices of the American way of dying. Neumann is part investigative journalist, part memoirist, an elegant and clear-eyed writer drawing from all corners of argument and experience to summon us to a better, more honest way of thinking about how we care for the dying and how we, too, will confront death in our time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jeff Sharlet, author of <i>Sweet Heaven When I Die</i><br><br>&#x201c;A powerful, elegant look at how we face death: both the ways we try to stave it off and the process of accepting its inevitability.

It was early morning and still</p><p>cool; a breeze off the river Dnieper rustled gently over</p><p>the scores of unwashed bodies. It was July and the water</p><p>below the embankment flowed smoothly and serenely</p><p>within the Dnieper&#x2019;s broad banks now, the ice</p><p>floes having finally melted early the month before. The</p><p>consequent flooding had eased now as well, sending</p><p>cleansing river smells upward.</p><p>The sun had just risen behind Kiev, showing bright</p><p>gold behind the endless stretch of barren hills and jagged</p><p>mountains to the east. The stench of winter-dirty</p><p>furs and scrawny bodies too long unwashed wouldn&#x2019;t</p><p>offend the nostrils until later in the day, even here in</p><p>the slave ring. The only thing here to offend anyone was</p><p>the abject human misery, and that was a condition so</p><p>familiar in a place like this, it hardly bore notice.</p><p>Merrik Haraldsson had unfastened the pounded silver</p><p>brooch and slipped its sharp point from the soft otter</p><p>fur cloak. He&#x2019;d slung the cloak over his arm as he</p><p>walked toward the slave market&#x2019;s perimeter. He&#x2019;d come</p><p>from his longboat, The Silver Raven, moored below at</p><p>a long wooden pier that lay in a protected inlet of the</p><p>Dnieper just below Kiev. He wasn&#x2019;t sweating now, but</p><p>the climb was a hard one, and he&#x2019;d walked briskly,</p><p>wanting to be here as early as possible to find a slave</p><p>his mother would approve before they&#x2019;d been picked</p><p>over and only the sick and wasted were left.</p><p>The Khagan-Rus slave market was set apart from the</p><p>town. Its name was the same as that of the prince of</p><p>Kiev: a reminder that there was a tax at each purchase</p><p>that would go directly into Prince Khagan-Rus&#x2019;s capacious</p><p>pockets.</p><p>Merrik turned to Oleg, a man he&#x2019;d known since they&#x2019;d</p><p>both been boys&#x2014;wild and passionate and eager to best</p><p>their older brothers and acquire their own longboats to</p><p>trade and fight and grow rich, rich enough to buy their</p><p>own farmsteads sometime in a future that they pondered</p><p>only rarely, richer even than their fathers and</p><p>older brothers.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;We will leave after I buy a female slave. Keep a</p><p>sharp eye, Oleg, for I don&#x2019;t want a drudge for my</p><p>mother&#x2019;s longhouse, or a sloe-eyed maid that would unduly</p><p>strain my father&#x2019;s faithfulness. He has had no concubine</p><p>for thirty years.

Very well, then, I think of my brother&#x2019;s wife.</p><p>Sarla is a shy little thing and could easily be governed</p><p>by a clever female, slave or no.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;And your brother is a man of strong appetites, Merrik.</p><p>A female doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to be toothsome</p><p>for Erik to want her. Look at Caylis, I&#x2019;ll grant you she&#x2019;s</p><p>a beauty even though her son is close to ten years old</p><p>now, but Megot, whom he beds just as much, is a plump</p><p>pullet and her chins shake when she laughs.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Aye, &#x2019;tis true. We must consider many factors before</p><p>I pick the right female. My mother needs a female slave</p><p>who will be loyal to her and work only for her. My</p><p>mother wants to teach her to spin, for her fingers stiffen</p><p>and give her pain now. Roran told me this should be an</p><p>excellent selection this morning, many slaves were</p><p>brought in just last night from Byzantium.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Aye, and the great golden city of Miklagard. How I</p><p>should like to voyage there, Merrik. It is the greatest</p><p>city in the world, it is said.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Aye, &#x2019;tis difficult to believe that more than half a</p><p>million people live there. Next summer we will have to</p><p>build a stronger longboat, for the currents and rapids</p><p>below Kiev are vicious. There are seven rapids and each</p><p>is more deadly than the last. The one called Aifur kills</p><p>more men than all the others combined. Even the portage</p><p>is dangerous for there are many vicious tribes living</p><p>along the Dnieper waiting for men to come ashore</p><p>with their longboats to drag them overland to beyond</p><p>the rapids. Aye, we&#x2019;ll join an armada of other trading</p><p>ships for protection. I don&#x2019;t wish to die just to see Miklagard</p><p>and the Black Sea.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;The Aifur, huh?&#x2019;&#x2019; Oleg grinned at Merrik. &#x2018;&#x2018;You have</p><p>been talking to other traders, Merrik. You are already</p><p>preparing this in your mind, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Aye, I am, but Oleg, we grow rich trading in Birka</p><p>and Hedeby, for we are known there and trusted. The</p><p>Irish slaves brought more silver than even I believed</p><p>possible. And this year we grew even richer trading our</p><p>Lapp furs in Staraya Ladoga. Remember that man who</p><p>bought every reindeer comb we had? He told me he had</p><p>more women than he wanted and all of them begged</p><p>combs from him. He said their hair would beggar him.</p><p> &#x2018;&#x2018;Nay, we will wait to travel to Miklagard next year.</p><p>Be content.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018; &#x2019;Tis you who aren&#x2019;t content, Merrik.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Very well, I will be patient. We return home with</p><p>more silver than our fathers and brothers have. We are</p><p>rich, my friend, and there is no one to gainsay us now.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Forget not that lovely blue silk that came from the</p><p>Caliphate, at least that&#x2019;s what Old Firren claimed.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;He&#x2019;s a liar who has grown over the years to believe</p><p>his own words, but the material is beyond beautiful.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;Aye, and you will continue the lie. Will you give it</p><p>to your bride? You plan to buy your own farmstead now,</p><p>Merrik? Or perhaps return with your bride to her</p><p>father&#x2019;s?&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>Merrik said nothing, but he frowned. During the winter,</p><p>his father had negotiated with the Thoragassons,</p><p>not bothering to tell his son until the two fathers had</p><p>come to agreement. Merrik barely knew the seventeenyear-</p><p>old Letta. He&#x2019;d felt anger at his father at such interference,</p><p>for Merrik was, after all, nearly twenty-four</p><p>years old, but he&#x2019;d said nothing. The girl was lovely,</p><p>appeared gentle, and her dowry would be impressive.</p><p>He would look closely at her when he returned home,</p><p>then make his decision. But if he wedded her he would</p><p>have to leave his father&#x2019;s farmstead, for already his eldest</p><p>brother and his wife of two years, the gentle Sarla,</p><p>lived there and would continue there after their parents</p><p>died. Surely they would have many babes, and soon it</p><p>would be too crowded, what with all his father&#x2019;s and</p><p>brother&#x2019;s people and his own men and slaves as well.</p><p>He shook his head. He disliked thinking of leaving his</p><p>home, but if he wed, he would have to take his wife</p><p>somewhere, and there was no more land in Vestfold</p><p>that could be farmed. His brother, Rorik, had gone to</p><p>Hawkfell Island, just off the coast of Britain, and had</p><p>prospered. Ah, but to leave his home, it was something</p><p>he didn&#x2019;t yet wish to do. He also disliked knowing he</p><p>was now rich enough to leave.</p><p>He said only to Oleg, &#x2018;&#x2018;A farmstead and a wife are two</p><p>decisions a man must weigh carefully.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2018;That is what my father says, but he is always smiling</p><p>at me when he says it. Think you he wants me out</p><p>of his longhouse?&#x2019;&#x2019;</p><p>There were at least eighty slaves in the pit, as it was</p><p>called. They were of all ages, both sexes in nearly equal</p><p>numbers, some few still proud, their shoulders squared,</p><p>but most stood still as stones with their heads bowed,</p><p>knowing what was to come, perhaps praying to their</p><p>gods that the men or women who bought them would</p><p>be kind.</p><p>Merrik walked slowly through the rows. The young</p><p>women were lined up on one side, the older women behind</p><p>them, and the boys and men on the other side of</p><p>the pit. There were guards only behind the men, whips</p><p>in their hands, watching, ever watching, silent and</p><p>menacing, but they really weren&#x2019;t concerned. None of</p><p>this group would cause any problems. They&#x2019;d been broken</p><p>sufficiently since they&#x2019;d been captured on raids,</p><p>some of them had been slaves for decades, some even</p><p>born of slaves.</p><p>It was a sight Merrik had seen since he&#x2019;d been a boy</p><p>when his father had first taken him to York to buy</p><p>slaves. This was nothing new, save that this slave market</p><p>wasn&#x2019;t as grim or as dirty and didn&#x2019;t smell yet since</p><p>it was so early in the day and they were in the cool fresh</p><p>air of Kiev and not in the Danelaw where the Saxons</p><p>smelled as bad as the slaves, and their stench filled the</p><p>air. Here a man could breathe as he made his selections.</p><p>Many of the girls were fine looking and appeared</p><p>clean enough. They were from all parts of the world,</p><p>some with yellowish skin and beautifully slanted eyes</p><p>and the thickest black hair he&#x2019;d ever seen, long and</p><p>board-straight. They were slight, and all had their</p><p>heads down. There were redheads and blonds from</p><p>Samarkand, some very tall and broadly built, others</p><p>squat with heavy torsos and short legs who hailed from</p><p>Bulgar and beyond. Merrik saw a girl who pleased him.</p><p>He realized she pleased him too much, for she had the</p><p>pale golden hair of his people, pale clear flesh, and a</p><p>long slender body. He felt a mild spurt of lust and shook</p><p>his head. No, she wouldn&#x2019;t do for his mother. His</p><p>brother would soon have her flat on her back, if Merrik</p><p>didn&#x2019;t take her first. He wouldn&#x2019;t provide another concubine</p><p>for his brother Erik, for unlike his brother, he</p><p>saw how much it hurt Sarla when her husband ignored</p><p>her at night, then took himself off to bed with one of his</p><p>women.</p><p>He must search for a comely face, but not too comely,</p><p>certainly no more than a pleasant face, perhaps one on</p><p>the broad, flat side. His brother disliked thin women;</p><p>Merrik searched out females with hollow cheeks, showing</p><p>bones. He selected three possible young slave girls,</p><p>turned to search out the slave-auction merchant, Valai,</p><p>to bargain. As he waited for Valai to finish with a Swedish</p><p>merchant who smelled of rotted fish and stale sex,</p><p>he realized he&#x2019;d seen that same merchant&#x2014;so obese he</p><p>wheezed even as he spoke&#x2014;the night before with a</p><p>dozen more merchants at the house of a man who had</p><p>many female slaves to sell. Each merchant was given a</p><p>girl and they had, each one in turn, with all the others</p><p>looking on, stripped the girls and had sex there on the</p><p>wooden benches that lines the inside wall of the great</p><p>hall. Merrik had felt immediate lust, for he saw that</p><p>there were still half a dozen girls left and one would be</p><p>his, until he saw a merchant over a girl, and the girl</p><p>was lying there, her eyes closed, so still she could have</p><p>been dead, and the fat merchant had shoved into her,</p><p>huffing, his great belly shaking, until, finally, he&#x2019;d</p><p>spilled his seed inside her. She&#x2019;d never opened her eyes.</p><p>Merrik saw tears seeping from beneath her closed eyelids,</p><p>streaking down her face. He had left.</p><p>He turned away from the fat merchant, and looked</p><p>indifferently at the long line of men and boys. He froze.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know why that of all the scores of men he</p><p>looked directly at the boy, but somehow, once he had,</p><p>he couldn&#x2019;t seem to look away. The boy was perhaps</p><p>twelve years old, not older than thirteen. He was so thin</p><p>Merrik could see the long bones clearly in his bare</p><p>arms, the knobby scabbed elbows, the wrists so thin he</p><p>could wrap his fingers about them twice over, long narrow</p><p>hands held loosely to his sides. His legs, bare from</p><p>the knees down were just as thin and very white where</p><p>they weren&#x2019;t blackened and streaked with filth and</p><p>scabs from cuts. He could even see the pale blue veins.</p><p>The boy was pathetic and would die soon if he weren&#x2019;t</p><p>bought by a master who would at least feed him properly.</p><p>He&#x2019;d doubtless been mistreated in the past. He</p><p>was wearing rags and a ripped filthy sealskin.</p><p>Not that it concerned Merrik. The boy was a slave</p><p>and would be sold, perhaps to a cruel master, perhaps</p><p>not, perhaps to a master who would let him buy his</p><p>freedom someday. It was a common practice and perhaps</p><p>the lad would be lucky. It didn&#x2019;t matter. Ah, but</p><p>there was something about him that held Merrik very</p><p>still, that wouldn&#x2019;t allow him to look away. But he</p><p>forced himself to look away. He wanted to sail from</p><p>Kiev this morning and there was much he still had to</p><p>do before leaving. He turned to go when the boy </p><p>denly looked up and their eyes met. The boy&#x2019;s eyes were</p><p>a gray-blue, two colors that sounded normal, even common,</p><p>particularly in Norway, but this boy&#x2019;s eyes were</p><p>different. The gray color was deeper than the rich pewter</p><p>bowl Merrik&#x2019;s mother had received as a gift upon</p><p>her wedding to his father, and the blue darker than a</p><p>sea in winter. He could tell that the boy&#x2019;s flesh was very</p><p>white despite all the dirt. His brows were dark and</p><p>well-drawn but the tangled, filthy mat of hair on his</p><p>head was too dirty and oily to determine its true color.</p><p>It was simply dull and dark and filthy. The boy was</p><p>beneath notice were it not for those eyes. They caught</p><p>Merrik cold. Eyes weren&#x2019;t made filthy; but eyes could</p><p>reflect a man or woman&#x2019;s thoughts, and the boy&#x2019;s eyes</p><p>were drained empty, dull, accepting. Certainly that</p><p>wasn&#x2019;t odd. But then, quite suddenly, there was a remarkable</p><p>shift&#x2014;where there&#x2019;d been emptiness, there</p><p>was now coldness and a look of defiance that would</p><p>probably get the boy killed or beaten to death if he</p><p>didn&#x2019;t learn to mask that spark better. In a flash that</p><p>look of defiance turned to one of anger, immense anger</p><p>that held such violence and rage, it shook Merrik. Then,</p><p>just as suddenly, the boy&#x2019;s eyes became blank again, all</p><p>that fury and passion buried beneath hopelessness and</p><p>awareness that his lot in life was that of a slave and</p><p>probably would remain so until he died. It was as if</p><p>Merrik could see the boy withdrawing into himself. He</p><p>could see him dying and accepting death before his</p><p>eyes.</p><p>Merrik roused himself from this ridiculous revery.</p><p>The boy was a slave, nothing more. It didn&#x2019;t matter if</p><p>he&#x2019;d been captured from a hovel in a small village or</p><p>from a rich farmhouse. Merrik would never see him</p><p>again after he left the slave pit. He would cease to think</p><p>about him the moment his hand was on the rudder of</p><p>his longboat and the wind from the sails was sharp in</p><p>his face. He shrugged and shook his head. He turned</p><p>then when Oleg tugged on his arm to point out another</p><p>slave.</p><p>He heard an agonized cry and turned back.

Katherine Profeta, a working dramaturg for more than fifteen years, shifts the focus from asking &#x201c;Who is the dramaturg?&#x201d; to &#x201c;What does the dramaturg think about?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profeta explores five arenas for the dramaturg&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;text and language, research, audience, movement, and interculturalism. Drawing on her extended collaboration with choreographer and visual artist Ralph Lemon, she grounds her thinking in actual rehearsal-room examples and situates practice within theoretical discourse about contemporary dramaturgy. Moving between theory and practice, word and movement, question and answer until these distinctions blur, she develops the foundational concept of dramaturgical labor as a quality of motion.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dramaturgy in Motion</i> will be invaluable to practitioners and scholars interested in the processes of creating contemporary dance and movement performance&#x2014;particularly artists wondering what it might be like to collaborate with a dramaturg and dramaturgs wondering what it might be like to collaborate on movement performance.

Old Testament scholar Christopher R. Seitz has written <i>Prophecy and Hermeneutics</i> as a way of revisiting, from the ground floor up, what gave rise to studies of the prophets in our modern period. In addition, Seitz clearly shows that a new conceptuality of prophecy, hermeneutics, history, and time is needed--one that is appropriate to current views on Isaiah and the Twelve. Scholars, students, professors, and theological libraries will find this an essential foundational resource.</p><p>"It is rare when reviewing a book to recognize that a profound paradigm shift is being proposed that deeply affects how the Old Testament prophets are to be understood. Building on over two decades of probing, critical exegesis, Christopher Seitz now offers a magisterial overview of the entire field and outlines a new and brilliant hermeneutical synthesis of biblical prophecy that restores the centrality of the canonical Scriptures to the church."--<b>Brevard S. Childs</b>, Yale University Divinity School<br><br>"Building on the long history of prophetic introduction and interpretation, Seitz offers a new way of viewing the prophets. He takes the realities of time and history with utmost seriousness but also attends to the hermeneutical implications of the present form of the prophetic books. The future of theological interpretation of Scripture depends on such breakthroughs as Seitz offers in these pages. We will have to read the prophets differently henceforth."--<b>Patrick D. Miller</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"Chris Seitz is one of the most insightful and creative biblical theologians working in the field today. In this book he shows us how traditional historical-critical readings have brought us to an impasse and then marks out a bold new path with his own proposal to take the canonical form of prophetic literature seriously. No one will look at the prophetic corpus in the same way after being tutored by Seitz."--<b>Gary Anderson</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"Seitz has offered a fresh and bold proposal for understanding the formation and theological significance of prophetic literature. In rich dialogue with Gerhard von Rad and building on recent scholarly research devoted to the Book of the Twelve, Seitz discerns a process of 'figural integration' in prophetic literature. Prophetic words were, in his judgment, fulfilled, not in some simplistic fashion, but over the course of time and, ultimately, in the New Testament. All those interested in prophetic literature and the character of Scripture will find this volume both challenging and useful."--<b>David L. Petersen</b>, Emory University<br><br>"This is a highly interesting book. Christopher Seitz shows in detail how historical questions about the different books within the Twelve are useful and even necessary but that they must finally move into an understanding of the text in its final form. It can be expected that this book will cause a vivid methodological discussion."--<b>Rolf Rendtorff</b>, Heidelberg University<b>Christopher R.

How much is reflected in a remark Martin Luther King Jr. made to Don Newcombe: &#34;You&#39;ll never know what you and Jackie and Roy did to make it possible to do my job.&#34; Red Barber was perfectly situated to observe this drama. Broadcaster for the Dodgers, friend of Branch Rickey-who confided in him before and during the year of decision-and keen student of the game and the behavior of its players, Red held the microphone as the story unfolded with a cast of characters that included baseball immortals Duke Snyder, Leo Durocher, Pee Wee Reese, Peter Reiser, Larry McPhail, and Joe DiMaggio.

Now business is booming at her charming new tea room, Thyme for Tea<b>&#x2014;</b>but China is too distracted to revel in her latest entrepreneurial triumph. When she&#x2019;s not trying to spend more time with her new husband and stepson, she&#x2019;s worrying about her best friend, Ruby, who just hasn&#x2019;t been herself lately. To further complicate matters, China has to round up a supply of mistletoe, the season&#x2019;s most popular herb. It seems an easy enough task<b>&#x2014;</b>until her chief supplier turns up dead... </p><p></p></p><p>China Bayles, a lawyer who's dropped out of practice but hasn't yet handed in her bar card, is back in business at Thyme and Season, her herb shop in Pecan Springs, Texas. The shop is so successful that China and Ruby, a friend with another remarkably successful New Age boutique named Crystal Cave, have added a tea room--named, of course, Thyme for Tea. Pecan Springs is getting to sound a lot like Sausalito, but apparently a lot of tourists pass through the west Texas town on their way to or from the Pecan Pageant, the Herb Fair, and, presumably, other unnamed attractions. <p> This ninth China Bayles mystery is a cozy case of confused property lines that lead a couple of likable people into a confrontation that ends in murder. Unfortunately, the dead man was China's main supplier of the herb of the title, and Christmas is just around the corner. So it behooves China (along with her new husband, a retired police detective, and her close friends, who all seem to be in law enforcement) to straighten things out, nail the culprit, and reestablish the mistletoe supply as soon as possible. Which they do, in a whimsical story that's as much about China's strained relationship with Ruby and her new life as a wife and stepmother as it is about who killed the Mistletoe Man. This all-but-bloodless tale is long on charm and local color and short on action. Susan Wittig Albert's quirky characters and their customs are on display (like the maiden lady who believes she's been abducted by aliens) rather than suspense or plot. But Albert's many fans won't mind a leisurely afternoon with China or the herbal lore that's served up as an appetizer before each chapter. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley.

Of course, Jack Kerouac&#39;s &#34;239th Chorus&#34; is a standout, but there are also swinging poems from Etheridge Knight, Marilyn Hacker, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and many others.Since the turn of the century, there have been hundreds of poems responding to jazz in all its musical and cultural overtones. Although many people associate this union only with the poetry and jazz readings of the Beat movement, the range of poetic and jazz anesthetics, not merely from writers across the United States but from countries around the world as well, embraces an enormous, cross-cultural gathering of writers.

This relationship was never easy, however, as&nbsp;anticolonial thinkers have resisted the historical determinism, teleology, Eurocentrism, and singular emphasis that some Marxisms place on class identity at the expense of race, nation, and popular identity. In recent decades, the conflict between dialectics and postcolonial theory has only deepened. In <i>Decolonizing Dialectics </i>George Ciccariello-Maher breaks this impasse by bringing the work of Georges Sorel, Frantz Fanon, and Enrique Dussel together with contemporary Venezuelan politics to formulate a dialectics suited to the struggle against the legacies of colonialism and slavery. This is a decolonized dialectics premised on constant struggle in which progress must be fought for and where the struggles of the wretched of the earth themselves provide the only guarantee of historical motion.</p><p>George Ciccariello-Maher is Associate Professor of Politics and Global Studies at Drexel University and the author of <i>We Created Ch�vez: A People's History of the Venezuelan Revolution</i>, also published by Duke University Press."Critiques of the dialectic are a constant in the contemporary intellectual scene, most of them unconsciously animated by dialectical logic, as George Ciccariello-Maher demonstrates. His book traces the dialectical logic of two fundamental contemporary movements, the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela and the internal debates within Black politics and theory. At the same time, he restores three great antidialectical thinkers&#x2014;Sorel, Fanon, and Dussel&#x2014;to their full dialectical stature, in analyses that range from the nature of violence to the different moments of nationalism and colonialism. It is an energetic and stimulating new intervention that enhances the theoretical canon and forces a welcome rethinking of practice itself." (Fredric Jameson)<br><br>"If the Euro-dialectic of Hegel and Marx has limited its adventures to the poles of master and slave, or bourgeoisie and proletariat, a decolonized dialectic must take in far more territory to be true to our multipolar non-Euro world. Drawing on Sorel, Fanon, and Dussel, George Ciccariello-Maher demonstrates how this classic philosophical concept can be dynamically developed to illuminate the logics of the emancipatory struggles of the global South against white supremacy and colonial/neo-colonial rule."

Here, for the first time, is a collection of his stories for teen and adult readers alike. From the streets of his famed Newford to the alleys of Bordertown to the realms of Faerie, this is storytelling that will transfix and delight, with characters who will linger in the mind, many of them from his novels. Featuring an illuminating preface by acclaimed author, anthologist, and critic Terri Windling, Waifs and Strays is a must-own for de Lint fans, and an ideal introduction to his work for newcomers.</p><p><b>Charles de Lint (www.charlesdelint.com)&nbsp;</b>is the author of more than seventy adult, young adult, and children&#x2019;s books. Renowned as one of the trailblazers of the modern fantasy genre, he is the recipient of the World Fantasy, White Pine, Crawford, and Aurora awards. The first book of the Wildlings trilogy,&nbsp;<i>Under My Skin</i>, won the 2013 Aurora Award for Young Adult Fiction. De Lint is a poet, songwriter, performer, and folklorist, and he writes a monthly book-review column for The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction.Grade 8 Up-Mythic fiction is at its best in this anthology of stories of memorable heroines, rooted not in a secondary world but in an urban environment. The author introduces each selection, providing insight and interesting biographical information. The subject of two stories is a 16-year-old vampire named Apples who receives "the Gift" from a stranger during a Bryan Adams concert. She hopes to "turn" her sister Cassie when she is older, if she agrees, so they can live together forever. Poking fun at the television version of a teenage vampire, the heroine offers a more pragmatic view of her lot in life as she avenges evil doings in her neighborhood. In the section "Bordertown," where magic and reality coexist, an elf named Manda saves the life of a Harley-riding black man who is the neighborhood peacekeeper in a city rife with prejudice and violence. Elements of Robin Hood, Merlin, Native American mythology, and Celtic music weave through each story. Some of the heroines are humans who briefly tiptoe into a magical realm or are skeptical about its existence. De Lint's characters are often lonely and intelligent misfits whose self-discovery triumphs over plot. Described as "urban fantasy," these stories represent a hybrid genre for readers who only want one arm through the door into another world.<br><i>Vicki Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Faith of Jesus Christ: The Narrative Substructure of Galatians 3:1-4:11 (The Biblical Resource Series)</h2><p>Widely praised as a major contribution to Pauline studies, Richard Hays&#39;s Faith of Jesus Christ is now available in an expanded second edition complete with a new preface by the author and a substantial dialogue about the book with James D. G. Dunn. In this important study Hays argues against the mainstream that any attempt to account for the nature and method of Paul&#39;s theological language must first reckon with the centrality of narrative elements in his thought. Through an in-depth investigation of Galatians 3:1-4:11, Hays shows that the framework of Paul&#39;s thought is neither a system of doctrines nor his personal religious experience&#39; both of which are the most common approaches to Paul&#39;s writing &#39;but the &#34;sacred story&#34; of Jesus Christ. Above all, Paul&#39;s thought is guided by his concern to draw out the implications of the gospel story, particularly how the &#34;faith of Jesus Christ&#34; reflects the mission of the church.</p><p></p><h2>Policing Sexuality: The Mann Act and the Making of the FBI</h2><p><p>America&#x2019;s first anti&#x2013;sex trafficking law, the 1910 Mann Act, made it illegal to transport women over state lines for prostitution &#x201c;or any other immoral purpose.&#x201d; It was meant to protect women and girls from being seduced or sold into sexual slavery. But, as Jessica Pliley illustrates, its enforcement resulted more often in the policing of women&#x2019;s sexual behavior, reflecting conservative attitudes toward women&#x2019;s roles at home and their movements in public. By citing its mandate to halt illicit sexuality, the fledgling Bureau of Investigation gained entry not only into brothels but also into private bedrooms and justified its own expansion.<i></i></p><p><i>Policing Sexuality</i> links the crusade against sex trafficking to the rapid growth of the Bureau from a few dozen agents at the time of the Mann Act into a formidable law enforcement organization that cooperated with state and municipal authorities across the nation. In pursuit of offenders, the Bureau often intervened in domestic squabbles on behalf of men intent on monitoring their wives and daughters. Working prostitutes were imprisoned at dramatically increased rates, while their male clients were seldom prosecuted.</p><p>In upholding the Mann Act, the FBI reinforced sexually conservative views of the chaste woman and the respectable husband and father. It built its national power and prestige by expanding its legal authority to police Americans&#x2019; sexuality and by marginalizing the very women it was charged to protect.</p></p><p>Jessica R. Pliley is Assistant Professor of Women&#x2019;s History at Texas State University.&#x201c;A fascinating, first-rate study. Using a remarkable trove of documents in the Bureau of Investigation&#x2019;s white slavery files, <b>Pliley </b>resurrects a lost history of conflicts over gender, sexuality, masculinity, disease, and deviance in the early twentieth-century United States.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Beverly Gage, author of <i>The Day Wall Street Exploded</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant, counterintuitive history of the FBI that takes women from the margins&#x2015;party girls and runaways, adventurers and adulterers, hardened hustlers and delinquent daughters&#x2015;and shows how they were central to the rise of federal power in America. Written in crystal clear, jargon-free prose, and brimming with important insights, <i>Policing Sexuality</i> is a major contribution to the histories of sexuality and government surveillance, and will be required reading for anyone interested in the sex trade, past, present, or future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Debby Applegate, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>The Most Famous Man in America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The White-Slave Traffic Act, commonly known as the Mann Act, was passed in the United States in 1910 and made it a felony to transport any &#x2018;woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose&#x2019; across state lines. It was designed to fight a perceived growth of prostitution, especially the trafficking in of women from Europe to America. <b>Pliley</b>, drawing largely from the records of the Bureau of Immigration, Bureau of Investigation, and then Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), examines the way these agencies used the expansion of their powers less to protect women and more to control sexuality according to their own conservative culture. Using case files, Pliley shows how ideas about women&#x2019;s sexuality and the vagueness of the phrase &#x2018;any immoral purpose&#x2019; were used to police sexual and moral boundaries. She illustrates how the law was more often employed by the FBI before World War II to prosecute unapproved premarital, extramarital, and interracial sexual relationships, than to prosecute human trafficking...A valuable contribution for those curious about the history of women, gender, and sexuality, as well as those interested in the role of policing and the FBI in the cultural and political history of the U.S. in the 20th century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jessica Moran</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Policing Sexuality</i>, is an insightful document about the history of government surveillance and control of sex and sexuality in the United States...<b>Pliley</b>&#x2019;s intriguing and easy to read book is a brilliant resource for historians, researchers in the field of gender and sexuality and anyone who is interested in the legal and historical aspects of sex trafficking and state policies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nafiseh Sharifi</b><b>, </b><b><i>LSE Review of Books</i></b></p><h2>Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps</h2><p><p>"...

Yet just as things were about to turn around, she was abruptly fired, making front-page news around the world. <br><br> Fiorina has been the subject of endless debate and speculation. But she has never spoken publicly about crucial details of her time at HP, about the mysterious circumstances of her firing, or about many other aspects of her landmark career. Until now. <br><br> In this extraordinarily candid memoir, she reveals the private person behind the public persona. She shares her triumphs and failures, her deepest fears and most painful confrontations. She shows us what it was like to be an ambitious young woman at stodgy old AT&amp;T and then a fast- track executive during the spin-off of Lucent Technologies. Above all, she describes how she drove the transformation of legendary but deeply troubled HP, in the face of fierce opposition. <br><br> One of Fiorina's big themes is that in the end business isn't just about numbers; it's about people.This book goes beyond the caricature of the powerful woman executive to show who she really is and what the rest of us male or female, in business or not can learn from the tough choices she made along the way.</p><p>For her six years as CEO of technology giant Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorina was one of the most public faces in business, consistently chosen as the most powerful woman in corporate America. But after being ousted by the HP board of directors in early 2005, she stepped away from the spotlight. She returns to the public eye with her new memoir, <i>Tough Choices</i>, the story of her tenure at HP and of her unprecedented--and unexpected--rise to the top. While much of the early attention to the book will no doubt focus on her battles with the HP board and her dismissal--and she lays out her side of that story in full detail--what is more likely to give her book a wide and lasting readership is her account of the choices she made to get to that point. As she says, she never expected to become a captain of industry; she never planned to go into business at all. But what she found, as she tells in a straightforward, personal style, was that she had a talent and a taste for working with people and making the kinds of decisions that business leadership requires. In a series of "tough choices" that give her book its name, she gravitated toward the most challenging paths that were offered her. Those choices, which many around her told her not to make, were what led her to the top in record time. <p> She visited the Amazon.com offices to give a talk to our employees about the book before it was published, and we were so impressed with what she had to say--and the open and focused way she said it--that we wanted to share some of her visit with you. Click on the image below to watch a section of her talk that explains what fear and choice have to do with leadership: </p><p></p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td><br> Watch Carly Fiorina talk about <i>Tough Choices</i></td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong>Two Tough Choices</strong> </p><p> We also asked her to tell us here about two of the many tough choices she writes about in the book: </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Why did you decide to drop out of law school, and why was that a hard decision? </p><p> <strong>Fiorina:</strong> I went to UCLA Law School mainly because my father was a lawyer and he encouraged me to follow in his footsteps. From the very first day it left me cold. Although I could respect the law, I felt no passion for it. I had terrible headaches every day and barely slept for months. </p><p> When my father came to visit, I told him I hated it. He was concerned, but he didn't want me to quit. He had always taught me that quitting was the same as failure--you stuck it out, even in a tough situation. And so, although I had planned to tell him I'd decided to leave law school, I didn't. I went back and stuck it out for another month. </p><p> Then I came home one weekend to visit. I was in turmoil. As dramatic as it sounds, I had an epiphany while taking a shower on Sunday morning. My body had been trying to tell me something with all those months of headaches. I suddenly realized I had no idea why I was in law school at all. At twenty-two, at that moment, it finally dawned on me that my life couldn't be about pleasing my parents. </p><p> I think of that as the day I grew up. I had made a truly difficult decision on my own. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Tell us about the time when you were a junior sales person at AT&amp;T, and you had to choose whether or not to attend a meeting at a strip club. </p><p> <strong>Fiorina:</strong> One day my senior colleague, David, let me know that the two of our most important customers were coming to town for a meeting. I was delighted. It would be great to have my first introduction to these customers come from a veteran like him. </p><p> The day before the meeting, David came to my cubicle. "You know, Carly, I'm really sorry. I know we'd planned to have you meet the two directors. The thing is, they have a favorite restaurant here in D.C., and they've requested that we meet there. It's the Board Room. So I don't think you'll be able to join us." </p><p> This didn't make any sense to me, until someone else explained that the Board Room was an upscale strip club for businessmen. Between acts, the young women who worked there would dress in see-through baby-doll negligees and dance on top of the tables while the patrons ate lunch. </p><p> I was both very embarrassed and very anxious. I sat in the ladies' room to think about it in private, and worked myself into a state of near panic. I had no idea what I was supposed to do in this situation. I couldn't tell myself it didn&#x2019;t matter--it clearly was important to meet these clients and to convince David that I should be taken seriously. It never occurred to me to be outraged and demand that they not go--and that wouldn't have worked anyway. </p><p> Finally, I went to David's desk and said, "You know, I hope it won't make you too uncomfortable, but I think I'm going to go to lunch anyway. I'll meet you all there." You could have heard a pin drop in the office as everyone watched this scenario unfold. </p><p> What happened the next day at the strip club is a funny story, but I'll save that one for the book. </p><p></p><b>Advanced Praise:</b> <br> "Ms. Fiorina... will have her own say in a much-anticipated memoir arriving next month."<br> --<i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "The Fiorina buzz is expected to get even louder in October, when she releases her long-awaited tell-all book, Tough Choices."<br> --<i>USA Today</i> <br><br> "Fiorina's tome is sure to create media buzz."<br> --<i>Fortune</i> <br><br> "Ms. Fiorina plans to tell her version of events in a book being published next month."<br> --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br><br> "The saga has added piquancy because Ms Fiorina is scheduled to publish her memoirs, Tough Choices, next month, and some colourful revelations are expected."<br> --<i>The Times of London</i> <br><br> "With news stories circulating about corporate foul play... the media is consistently pointing to Fiorina's upcoming book as an opportunity for her to give her side of the story."<br> --<i>PW Daily</i></p><h2>What It Takes to Become a Chess Master: Chess Strategies That Get Results</h2><p>Chess players sometimes wonder if they have what it takes to become a chess master.

Time magazine opined that &#39;&#39;Rose,&#39;&#39; the book&#39;s final novella, &#39;&#39;by itself is worth the price of the book; it is the most powerful entry in Dubus&#39;s impressive canon.&#39;&#39; Finally, this third volume in the series draws together for the first time many of Dubus&#39;s previously uncollected stories, including work from the mid-1960s and the late 1990s. The earliest story appearing here in book form for the first time - &#39;&#39;The Cross Country Runner&#39;&#39; - was first published in the long-defunct Midwestern University Quarterly in 1966 when Dubus was 30 years old and only recently graduated from the Iowa Writers&#39; Workshop. The final story - the western-themed &#39;&#39;Sisters&#39;&#39; - is the last piece of fiction Dubus was working on when he died suddenly in 1999 at just 63 years old.</p><p>Andre Dubus was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana to a Cajun-Irish Catholic family. He graduated from the University of Iowa Writers&#39; Workshop and later moved to Massachusetts, where he taught creative writing at Bradford College. His life was marked with personal tragedies, as are those of his protagonists - ostensibly ordinary men who are drawn to addiction and violence as methods to distract themselves from their woes. Unlike his characters, however, Dubus eventually found success and repute, as well as the corresponding offers from large publishers. He nevertheless remained loyal to Godine until the end of his career.A welcome gathering in a worthy project to bring Dubus' work to a new generation of readers. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>...the three volumes reaffirm Dubus's status as a master, as an unparalleled excavator of the heart and its pains, its longings, its errors, its thumping against the constant threat of grief, despair, and loneliness. --Nina MacLaughlin, The Paris Review<br><br>...Dubus's frank and inquisitive stories of conscience are incisively of their time and ours. --Booklist Starred Review</p><h2>The Front (Win Garano)</h2><p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>When Patricia Cornwell introduced a quicksilver, cut-to-the-bone style and extraordinary cast of characters in At Risk, the result was electrifying.

It's a sunny afternoon, mid-May, and Harvard Square is crowded. He straddles a bench, overdressed and sweaty in a black Armani suit and black patent-leather Prada shoes, pretty sure the original owner of them is dead. </p><p>He got a feeling about it when the saleslady in the Hand-Me-Ups shop said he could have the "gently worn" outfit for ninety-nine dollars. Next she pulled out suits, shoes, belts, ties, even socks. DKNY, Hugo Boss, Gucci, Hermes, Ralph Lauren. All from the same <i>celebrity whose name I can't tell you</i>, and it occurred to Win that not so long ago, a wide receiver for the Patriots got killed in a car wreck. One eighty, six feet tall, muscular but not a moose. In other words, Win's size. </p><p>He sits alone at the picnic table, more self-conscious by the moment. Students, faculty, the elite-most of them in jeans, shorts, carrying knapsacks-cluster at other tables deep in conversations that include very few comments about the dull lecture District Attorney Monique Lamont just gave at the Forum. <i>No Neighbor Left Behind</i>. Win warned her it was a confusing title, not to mention a banal topic for such a prestigious political venue. She's not going to appreciate that he was right. He doesn't appreciate that she ordered him here on his day off so she could boss him around, belittle him. Make a note of this. Make a note of that. Call so and so. Get her a coffee. Starbucks. Latte with skim milk and Splenda. Wait for her outside in the heat while she hobnobs inside the air-conditioned Littauer Center. </p><p>He sullenly watches her emerge from the brick building escorted by two plainclothes officers from Massachusetts State Police, where Win is a homicide detective currently assigned to the Middlesex County District Attorney's detective unit. In other words, assigned to Lamont, who called him at home last night and said effective immediately he's on leave from his regular duties. <i>I'll explain after my lecture at the Forum. See you at two.</i> No further details. </p><p>She pauses to give an interview to the local ABC affiliate, then to NPR. She talks with reporters from <i>The Boston Globe</i> the AP, and that Harvard student, Cal Tradd, who writes for the <i>Crimson</i>, thinks he's from <i>The Washington Post</i>. The presses loves Lamont. The press loves to hate her. No one is indifferent to the powerful, beautiful DA-today, conspicuous in a bright green suit. Escada. This year's spring collection. Seems she's been on quite the shopping spree of late, a new outfit practically every time Win sees her. </p><p>She continues talking to Cal as she walks confidently across the brick plaza, past massive planters of azaleas, rhodendrons, and pink and white dogwoods. Blond, blue-eyed, pretty-boy Cal, so cool and collected, so sure of himself, never flustered, never frowns, always so damn pleasant. Says something while scribbling on his notepad, and Lamont nods, and he says something else, and she keeps nodding. Win wishes the guy would do something stupid, get himself kicked out of Harvard. Flunking out would be even better. What a friggin' pest. </p><p>Lamont dismisses Cal, signals for her plainclothes protection to give her privacy, and sits across from Win, her eyes hidden by reflective gray-tinted glasses. </p><p>"I thought it went well." She picks up her latte without thanking him for it. </p><p>"Not much of a turnout. But you seemed to make your point." He says. </p><p>"Obviously, most people, including you, don't grasp the enormity of the problem." That flat tone she uses when her narcissism has been insulted. "The decline of the neighborhoods is potentially as destructive as global warming. Citizens have no respect for law enforcement, no interest whatsoever in helping us or each other. This past weekend I was in New York, walking through Central Park, and noticed a backpack abandoned on a bench. Do you think a single person thought to call the police? Maybe consider there could be an explosive device inside it? No. Everyone just kept going, figuring if it blew up, it wasn't their problem as long as they didn't get hurt, I suppose." </p><p>"The world is going to hell, Monique." </p><p>"People have slipped into complacency, and here's what we're going to do about it," she says. "I've set the stage. Now we create the drama." </p><p>Every day with Lamont is drama. </p><p>She toys with her latte, looks around to see who's looking at her. "How do we attention? How do we take people who are jaded, desensitized, and make them care about crime? Care so much they decide to get involved at a grass-roots level? Can't be gangs, drugs, carjackings, robberies, burglaries. Why? Because people want a crime problem that's, let's be honest,' front-page news but happens to others, not to them." </p>"I wasn't aware people actually want a crime problem." He notices a skinny young woman with kinky red hair loitering near a Japanese maple not far from them. Dressed like Raggedy Ann, right down to her striped stockings and clunky shoes. Saw her the other week, in downtown Cambridge, loitering around the courthouse, probably some petty crime like shoplifting. <p>"An unsolved sexual homicide," Lamont is saying. "April fourth, 1962, Watertown." </p><p>"I see. Not a cold case this time but a frozen one," he says, keeping his eye on Raggedy Ann. "I'm surprised you even know where Watertown is." </p><p>In Middlesex County, her jurisdiction-along with some sixty other modest municipalities she doesn't give a damn about. </p><p>"Four square miles, population thirty-five thousand, very diverse ethnic base," she says. "The perfect crime that just so happens to have been committed in the perfect microcosm for my initiative. The chief will partner you up with his lead detective&amp; You know, the one who drives that monstrous scene truck. Oh, what is it the call her? </p><p>'"Stump." </p><p>"That's right. Because she's short and fat." </p><p>"She has a prosthesis, a below-the-knee amputation," he says. </p><p>"Cops can be so insensitive. I believe the two of you know each other, from the little grocery store around the corner from where she works a second job. So that's a good start. Helps to be friends with someone you're going to spend a lot of time with." </p><p>"It's an upscale gourmet shop, and it isn't just a second job, and we're not friends." </p><p>"You sound defensive. The two of you go out, maybe not get along? Because that could be a problem." </p><p>"Nothing personal between us, never even worked a case with her," Win says. "But I think you have, since Watertown has plenty of crime and she's been around as long as you have." </p><p>"Why? Has she talked about me." </p><p>"Usually we talk about cheese." </p><p>Lamont glances at her watch. "Let's go to the facts of the case. Janie Brolin."</p><p>"Never heard of her." </p><p>"British. She was blind, decided to spend a year in the States, chose Watertown, most likely because of Perkins, probably the most famous school for the blind in the world. Where Helen Keller went." </p><p>"Perkins wasn't located in Watertown back in the Helen Keller days. It was in Boston." </p><p>"And why would you know trivia like that?" </p><p>"Because I'm a trivial person. And obviously you've been planning this <i>drama</i> for a while. So why did you wait until the last minute to tell me about it?"</p><p>"This is very sensitive and must be handled very discreetly. Imagine being blind and realizing there's an intruder inside your apartment. That horror factor and something far more important. I think you're going to discover she very well may have been the Boston Strangler's first victim. </p><p>"You said early April 1962?" Win frowns.
